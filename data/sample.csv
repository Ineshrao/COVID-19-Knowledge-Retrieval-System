"INTRODUCTION In persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), little evidence exist on the effects of Alemtuzumab on physiological, physical, and cognitive function along with patient-reported outcomes, despite these domains are being rated as highly important. Therefore, our purpose was to perform a prospective observational study to examine these outlined outcomes during the first two years of Alemtuzumab treatment in pwMS. METHODS In n = 17 relapsing-remitting pwMS, physiological function [body composition; bone mineral content; muscle strength; aerobic capacity], physical function [6-min walk test (6MWT, primary outcome); timed 25 ft walk test (T25FWT); six spot step test (SSST); 9-step stair ascend (9SSA); timed up and go test (TUG); 5 × sit to stand test (5STS)], cognitive function [selective reminding test (SRT); symbol digit modalities test (SDMT)], and patient-reported outcomes [multiple sclerosis impact scale-29 (MSIS29); 12-item multiple sclerosis walking scale (MSWS12); modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS); hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)] were assessed prior to Alemtuzumab treatment initiation as well as 3, 6, 12, and 24 months into the treatment. RESULTS Improvements were observed at 24-month follow-up in T25FWT (+ 8%), SSST (+ 10%), SDMT (+ 5.2 points, 53% improved more than the clinical cut-off score) and SRT, whereas the primary outcome 6MWT, and all other remaining outcomes, remained stable throughout the Alemtuzumab treatment period. CONCLUSION The present findings suggest that Alemtuzumab treatment in relapsing-remitting pwMS can improve certain domains of physical function (short distance walking) and cognitive function (processing speed, memory), and furthermore stabilize physiological and physical function along with patient-reported outcomes.

"A Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak occurred in Korea between June 20 and July 28, 2015. A total of 186 patients were confirmed as being infected with MERS-CoV, 36 of whom died. Infection control nurses referred to hospital guidelines to address the screening and isolation needs of patients and instigated a variety of infection control activities to prevent MERS-CoV transmission at the frontlines of patient care. Their concerted effort is believed to have been instrumental in ending the outbreak.",Crisis prevention and management by infection control nurses during the Middle East respiratory coronavirus outbreak in Korea
"Observational studies are the basis for much of our knowledge of veterinary pathology and are highly relevant to the daily practice of pathology. However, recommendations for conducting pathology-based observational studies are not readily available. In part 1 of this series, we offer advice on planning and conducting an observational study with examples from the veterinary pathology literature. Investigators should recognize the importance of creativity, insight, and innovation in devising studies that solve problems and fill important gaps in knowledge. Studies should focus on specific and testable hypotheses, questions, or objectives. The methodology is developed to support these goals. We consider the merits and limitations of different types of analytic and descriptive studies, as well as of prospective vs retrospective enrollment. Investigators should define clear inclusion and exclusion criteria and select adequate numbers of study subjects, including careful selection of the most appropriate controls. Studies of causality must consider the temporal relationships between variables and the advantages of measuring incident cases rather than prevalent cases. Investigators must consider unique aspects of studies based on archived laboratory case material and take particular care to consider and mitigate the potential for selection bias and information bias. We close by discussing approaches to adding value and impact to observational studies. Part 2 of the series focuses on methodology and validation of methods.","Observational Study Design in Veterinary Pathology, Part 1: Study Design."
"OBJECTIVES: To summarise clinical presentation, diagnostic findings and long‐term outcome for dogs clinically diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin affecting the spinal cord alone. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for dogs diagnosed with presumptive spinal‐only meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin between 2006 and 2015. RESULTS: 21 dogs were included; the majority presented with an acute (43%) or chronic (52%) onset of neurological signs. Ambulatory paresis was the most common neurological presentation (67%). Neurological examination most commonly revealed a T3‐L3 myelopathy, and spinal hyperaesthesia was a common finding (71%). A spinal cord lesion was visible in 90% of cases on magnetic resonance imaging. Eighteen lesions (86%) showed parenchymal contrast enhancement and 17 lesions (81%) showed contrast enhancement of overlying meninges. All dogs were treated with immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticosteroids, sometimes combined with cytosine arabinoside. At time of data capture, 10/21 dogs (48%) had died or been euthanased because of the condition. Overall median survival time was 669 days. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dogs presenting with a progressive myelopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging features can possibly help to distinguish presumptive meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin from other more common spinal diseases. Overall, long‐term survival is guarded, approximately 50% of dogs will die or be euthanased despite appropriate therapy.","Clinical presentation, diagnostic findings and outcome in dogs diagnosed withpresumptive spinal‐only meningoen‐cephalomyelitis of unknown origin"
"PURPOSE: Hypovitaminosis D is a highly spread condition correlated with increased risk of respiratory tract infections. Nowadays, the world is in the grip of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic. In these patients, cytokine storm is associated with disease severity. In consideration of the role of vitamin D in the immune system, aim of this study was to analyse vitamin D levels in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and to assess any correlations with disease severity and prognosis. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we analysed demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 42 patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, treated in Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) of the Policlinic of Bari from March, 11 to April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Eighty one percent of patients had hypovitaminosis D. Based on vitamin D levels, the population was stratified into four groups: no hypovitaminosis D, insufficiency, moderate deficiency, and severe deficiency. No differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were found. A survival analysis highlighted that, after 10 days of hospitalization, severe vitamin D deficiency patients had a 50% mortality probability, while those with vitamin D &#8805; 10 ng/mL had a 5% mortality risk (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was found in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, treated in a RICU. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher mortality risk. Severe vitamin D deficiency may be a marker of poor prognosis in these patients, suggesting that adjunctive treatment might improve disease outcomes.",Vitamin D deficiency as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19
"Some camouflaged animals hide colour signals and display them only transiently. These hidden colour signals are often conspicuous and are used as a secondary defence to warn or startle predators (deimatic displays) and/or to confuse them (flash displays). The hidden signals used in these displays frequently resemble typical aposematic signals, so it is possible that prey with hidden signals have evolved to employ colour patterns of a form that predators have previously learned to associate with unprofitability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by conducting two experiments that examined the effect of predator avoidance learning on the efficacy of deimatic and flash displays. We found that the survival benefits of both deimatic and flash displays were substantially higher against predators that had previously learned to associate the hidden colours with unprofitability than against naive predators. These findings help explain the phenological patterns we found in 1568 macro-lepidopteran species on three continents: species with hidden signals tend to occur later in the season than species without hidden signals.",Prey with hidden colour defences benefit from their similarity to aposematic signals.
"COVID-19 can cause important sequels in the respiratory system and frequently presents loss of strength, dyspnea, polyneuropathies and multi-organic affectation. Physiotherapy interventions acquire a fundamental role in the recovery of the functions and the quality of life. Regarding the recovery phases after hospital discharge, the current evidence available is very preliminary. Telerehabilitation is presented as a promising complementary treatment method to standard physiotherapy. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized telerehabilitation intervention after discharge from hospital for the improvement of functional capacity and quality of life compared to a program of health education and/or care in a rehabilitation center. As secondary objectives, to identify the satisfaction and perception of patients with the telerehabilitation intervention and the presence of barriers to its implementation, as well as to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the health system. This study protocol will be carried out through a single blind multicenter randomized clinical trial in the south of Spain. We hypothesize that the implementation of a telerehabilitation program presents results not inferior to those obtained with the current standard intervention. If the hypothesis is confirmed, it would be an opportunity to define new policies and interventions to address this disease and its consequences.

"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most common complications in coronavirus disease 2019 patients suffering from acute lung injury (ALI). In ARDS, marked distortion of pulmonary architecture has been reported. The pulmonary lesions in ARDS include hemodynamic derangements (such as alveolar edema and hemorrhage), vascular and bronchiolar damage, interstitial inflammatory cellular aggregations, and eventually fibrosis. Bleomycin induces ARDS-representative pulmonary damage in mice and rats; therefore, we used bleomycin model mice in our study. Recently, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) was implicated in the development of ARDS and ALI. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of a TLR9 blocker (ODN2088) on bleomycin-induced pulmonary damage. We measured the apoptosis rate, inflammatory reaction, and fibroplasia in bleomycin- and bleomycin + ODN2088-treated mice. RESULTS: Our results showed a significant amelioration in bleomycin-induced damage to pulmonary architecture following ODN2088 treatment. A marked decrease in pulmonary epithelial and endothelial apoptosis rate as measured by cleaved caspase-3 expression, inflammatory reaction as indicated by tumor necrosis factor α expression, and pulmonary fibrosis as demonstrated by Van Gieson staining and α-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry were observed following ODN2088 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: All these findings indicate that blocking downstream TLR9 signaling could be beneficial in prevention or mitigation of ARDS through hemodynamic derangements, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis.",Blocking Toll-like receptor 9 attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which is responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a gateway into host cells. In this review, we summarise the biology of this enzyme, which plays a key role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin system modify the expression and activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in different ways. The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the expression and enzyme activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 are reviewed, and the consequences of these treatments for the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 infection are discussed.",Renin-angiotensin system blockers and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.",Activatable Carbocyanine Dimers for Photoacoustic and Fluorescent Detection of Protease Activity
"OBJECTIVES: There is little in-depth qualitative evidence of how symptoms manifest themselves in outpatients with COVID-19 and how these in turn impact outpatients’ daily lives. The objective of the study was therefore to explore the experience of outpatients with COVID-19 qualitatively, concerning the symptomatic experience and its subsequent impact on daily life. SETTING: Qualitative research study comprising virtual in-depth, open-ended interviews with outpatients and clinicians. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty US adult patients with COVID-19 were interviewed within 21 days of diagnosis. Patients were 60% female and 87% white, who had to self-report one of the following: fever, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, change/loss of taste/smell, vomiting/diarrhoea or body/muscle aches. Five independent clinicians were also interviewed about their experience treating outpatients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Transcripts were analysed thematically to organise symptoms and impacts of daily life into higher-order overarching categories, and subsequently propose a conceptual model. The adequacy of the sample size was assessed by conceptual saturation analysis. RESULTS: Patient-reported concepts were organised into six symptom themes (upper respiratory, lower respiratory, systemic, gastrointestinal, smell and taste, and other) and seven impact themes (activities of daily living, broad daily activities, leisure/social activities, and physical, emotional, professional and quarantine-specific impacts). Symptom type, severity, duration and time of onset varied by patient. Clinicians endorsed all patient-reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The manifestation of symptoms in outpatients is heterogeneous and affects all aspects of daily life. Outpatients offered new detailed insights into their symptomatic experiences, including heterogeneous experiences of smell and taste, and the impacts that symptoms had on their daily lives. Findings of this research may be used to supplement existing knowledge of the outpatient experience of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, to further inform treatment guidelines and to provide an evidence base for evaluating potential treatment benefits.",Patient experience of symptoms and impacts of COVID-19: a qualitative investigation with symptomatic outpatients
"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic it has become clear that there is a need for therapies that are capable of reducing damage caused to patients from infections. Infections that induce Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are especially devastating because lung damage is so critical and difficult to manage. Angiotensin (1–7) [A(1–7)] has already been shown to protect pulmonary health and architecture in various models of disease. There is also evidence that A(1–7) can modulate immune function and protect various organs (lung, kidney, and heart) from oxidative damage and inflammation. Here we focus on making a case for the development of novel therapies that target the protective arm of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS).",Countermeasure and therapeutic: A(1–7) to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 infection
BACKGROUND: The SARS-COV-2 is a novel coronavirus which is the etiological agent of the COVID-19 infection. The neurosurgical practice is not exempted from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Awake craniotomy in a COVID-19 positive patient pose a significant risk for theatre staff but intubation of a COVID-19 positive patient for surgery under general anesthesia also pose similar risk. METHOD: Federal Teaching Hospital Ido Ekiti is a tertiary hospital in suburban community in Southwest Nigeria with 300-bed capacity. The hospital is a designated COVID-19 treatment centre. A 69-year-old female patient was referred from a nearby COVID-19 treatment hospital on account of left parieto-occipital high grade glioma. She had awake craniotomy and gross total tumor excision. RESULT: There was no need to convert to general anesthesia and she had immediate post-operative neurological improvement. Repeat COVID-19 test on post-operative day 4 was negative and she was discharged home. Thirty-day post-operative review confirmed progressive motor gain. CONCLUSION: Awake craniotomy in COVID-19 positive patient with appropriate use of necessary PPEs is achievable.,Awake craniotomy in a Covid-19 positive patient: The challenges and outcome
"COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global crisis, whether it comes to a huge global health emergency or to the global economic crisis situation. It is one of the greatest challenges this generation is facing. Computational simulations are playing a huge rule in the prediction of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early predictions for future projections of the pandemic and are useful to estimate the efficiency of control action taken against this virus. The SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model is a commonly used model to compute the simulations of any infectious viral diseases and was widely used before to model and simulate SARS, EBOLA, Spanish Flu, etc. This paper presents a modified SEIR model with additional parameters taken into consideration such as the death, recovered and recovered with the chance of being infected again, vaccination and control efficiency;where the control represents the effectiveness of the lockdown. This factor is being controlled in order to extend the projections into controlled death, recovery, and infection. Specific information including time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, ageing factor of the population, and resusceptibility with temporal immune response are also included in the model. After that, the model examines the outcome of the system after adding a controllable vaccine with taking into consideration the vaccination rate and vaccine's efficacy. The numerical results are demonstrated to show the predictability range of this model.",Development of a Robust Mathematical Model to Estimate COVID-19 Cases in Lebanon Based on SEIRDV Modified Model
"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept the world in early 2020, all the Chinese universities and colleges adopted online learning to fulfill the directive saying “classes suspended but learning continues.” Understanding the impact of this large-scale online learning experience on the future online learning intention of Chinese university students can help design better blended-learning activities. This study applies flow experience and theory of planned behavior (TPB) to construct a theoretical framework for assumption making and the assumptions made are validated by data gained from questionnaires. A total of 6,933 students from 54 institutions in China participated in the investigation, with 5,456 valid questionnaires returned. This study employs partial least squares (PLS) regression and confirmative factor analysis (CFA) to analyze and estimate the measurement model and the structural model. The results indicate that the experience of home-based learning significantly influenced the attitudes of Chinese university students, which in turn had a positive influence on their intention to continue online learning. The research findings provide a theoretical framework and practical guidelines on building a scientific online learning platform with appropriate online learning environments and tasks for a post-COVID-19 era blended-learning in Chinese universities.",Impact of Home-Based Learning Experience During COVID-19 on Future Intentions to Study Online: A Chinese University Perspective
"The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on healthcare services around the world has been unprecedented. Surgical specialities, in particular, had to respond rapidly and adapt to continue to meet the needs of their patients in this ever-evolving and uncertain situation. With the cancellation of elective surgery and outpatient clinics, the majority of work carried out by spinal surgeons was obliterated. It was imperative emergency spinal care continued throughout the pandemic, with the creation of guidelines to assist spinal surgeons manage patients appropriately. Alongside assisting on the frontline, spinal surgeons had to triage referrals to ensure urgent care was still provided, undertake outpatient clinics virtually and ensure educational opportunities were available for colleagues. Paediatric spinal surgery was affected by the pandemic; although the virus did not significantly impact children to the same extent, a notable consequence of the lockdown restrictions was a reduction in GP referrals into the specialist service. In the event of any future pandemics, national spinal organizations have created guidelines to assist in the prioritization and care of spinal pathologies. While a ‘return to normality’ is a long way off, the impact of the past year will undoubtedly change spinal surgeons and their practice forever.",The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spinal surgery
"AIM: Data are limited on clinical characteristics and outcomes of recovered the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients with the reoccurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. PATIENTS & METHODS: Discharged patients in our hospital were included, who had recovered from COVID-19 with the reoccurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Six patients were redetectable and positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after discharge from 3 to 15 days. The main symptoms, although no fever, included fatigue, dry cough and pharyngeal or chest discomfort, which were generally milder in the repositive period compared with the period of initial infection. Their laboratory indexes were significantly improved compared with the initial infection, and the pulmonary lesions were continuously improving. All close contacts were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative. CONCLUSION: No worsening outcomes or active transmission to close contacts were found for the repositive COVID-19 patients.",Clinical characteristics and outcomes of discharged COVID-19 patients with reoccurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
"Study Objectives. To distinguish adverse events related to ribavirin therapy from those attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to determine the rate of potential ribavirin‐related adverse events. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Patients. A cohort of 306 patients with confirmed or probable SARS, 183 of whom received ribavirin and 123 of whom did not, between February 23, 2003, and July 1, 2003. Of the 183 treated patients, 155 (85%) received very high‐dose ribavirin; the other 28 treated patients received lower‐dose regimens. Measurements and Main Results. Data on all patients with SARS admitted to hospitals in Toronto were abstracted from charts and electronic databases onto a standardized form by trained research nurses. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between ribavirin use and each adverse event (progressive anemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, bradycardia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia) after adjusting for SARS‐related prognostic factors and corticosteroid use. In the primary logistic regression analysis, ribavirin use was strongly associated with anemia (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–6.1, p<0.0001), hypomagnesemia (OR 21, 99% CI 5.8–73, p<0.0001), and bradycardia (OR 2.3, 99% CI 1.0–5.1, p=0.007). Hypocalcemia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia were not associated with ribavirin use. The risk of anemia, hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia attributable to ribavirin use was 27%, 45%, and 17%, respectively. Conclusions. High‐dose ribavirin is associated with a high rate of adverse events. The use of high‐dose ribavirin is appropriate only for the treatment of infectious diseases for which ribavirin has proven clinical efficacy, or in the context of a clinical trial. Ribavirin should not be used empirically for the treatment of viral syndromes of unknown origin.",Adverse Events Associated with High‐Dose Ribavirin: Evidence from the Toronto Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
"At the end of 2019, an outbreak of unknown pathogen pneumonia occurred in China, then it was named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the rapid spread of COVID-19, a series of strict prevention and control measures were implemented to cut the spread of the epidemic. Influenza as a respiratory tract infection disease as COVID-19 might also be controlled. To assess the effects, we used the total passenger numbers sent in mainland China from 2018 to 2020 and the daily number of railway passenger (DNRP) flow in 2020 during Spring Festival travel rush to reflect the population movement and further to analyze newly and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 and influenza. We found that with implementing the series measures on COVID-19, not only COVID-19, but also influenza mitigated in China. The prevention and control measures for COVID-19 might be used in controlling respiratory tract diseases, and reducing the national health economic burden. When other countries issue measures on COVID-19 and influenza, they should consider adopting more aggressive epidemic prevention and control strategies.",Epidemic prevention and control measures in China significantly curbed the epidemic of COVID-19 and influenza
"Background: Acute onset polyarthritis is a common presentation in rheumatology outpatient consultations, which include both post-infectious arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs). COVID pandemic has added to the list of infectious agents that could result in arthritis. Materials and Methods: The retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre. The study included patients who presented with clinical suspicion of post-infectious arthritis between July-September 2019 and 2020. The study was extended for another 2 months to include patients who presented between October-November 2020. The patients were categorized into post-viral arthritis, post-COVID arthritis, chikungunya arthritis and AIRDs. The demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, examination findings and laboratory parameters and the response to treatment for each participant were collected and assessed. Results: In the year 2019 and 2020 (July-Sep), the corresponding number of patients analyzed were 20 and 33. The mean duration of presentation was 1.53 (±3.10) weeks. Chikungunya arthritis was noted in 10% of patients in 2019, while it was 15.15% in 2020. Other post-viral arthritis was identified in 65% and 66.67% of patients in 2019 and 2020 respectively. In the second part of the study, 65.68% of patients were classified as post-viral arthritis, including chikungunya arthritis, post-COVID arthritis and other post-viral arthritis. Around 27% were categorized as AIRDs. Rheumatoid factor negativity and anti-nuclear antibody negativity were found to be significant (P 0.0) in categorizing the patients into post-viral arthritis group, while presence of urinary symptoms (P 0.0) classified the patients into reactive arthritis. Conclusion: The study revealed that the presence of chikungunya arthritis across the two years was comparable. Post-COVID arthritis needs to be considered as a potential differential in post-infectious arthritis. There are no identifiable characteristics (clinical or a simple routine laboratory parameter) that could differentiate the causes of post-infectious arthritis from AIRDs. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

"INTRODUCTION: Eating and feeding disorders (EFD's) represent the psychiatric pathology with the highest mortality rate and one of the major disorders with the highest psychiatric and clinical comorbidity. The vagus nerve represents one of the main components of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system and is involved in important neurophysiological functions. Previous studies have shown that vagal nerve stimulation is effective in the treatment of resistant major depression, epilepsy and anxiety disorders. In EFD's there are a spectrum of symptoms which with Transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (Ta-VNS) therapy could have a therapeutic efficacy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sample subjects is composed by 15 female subjects aged 18-51. Admitted to a psychiatry community having diagnosed in according to DSM-5: anorexia nervosa (AN) (N=9), bulimia nervosa (BN) (N=5), binge eating disorder (BED) (N=1). Psychiatric comorbidities: bipolar disorder type 1 (N=4), bipolar disorder type 2 (N=6), border line disorder (N=5). The protocol included 9 weeks of Ta-VNS stimulation at a frequency of 1.5-3.5 mA for 4 hours per day. The variables detected in four different times (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4) are the following: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-HDRS-17), Body Mass Index (BMI), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI). RESULTS: Data analysis showed statistically significant differences between recording times (p>0.05) in HAM-D (t0=18.28±5.31; t4=9.14±7.15), in BAI (t0=24.7±10.99; t4=13.8±7.0) the reported values show how during (T0-T4) the treatment there are a decay of the degree in the depressive state, in the state of anxiety and an improvement in the value of BMI. In particular, the BMI in the AN-BN sub-sample had a minimum gain of 5% and a maximum of 11%. The analysis of H.R.V. did not show a significant changes among subjects thus confirming the discordance of the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in EFD's. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sample does not possess a relevant value to determine long-term efficacy of Ta-VNS or on a larger number of patients, this study reports how the application of neuro-stimulation in EFD's may become an ADD-ON in therapeutic approach. Indeed, substantial improvements are highlighted in the results and confirmed hypotheses proposed by the study.",Trans-auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation in the Treatment of Recovered Patients Affected by Eating and Feeding Disorders and Their Comorbidities

Methods: Two hundred seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 146 males and 124 females, with median age of 51 (9,89). The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. Results: 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive. According to the number of lung segments involved in the lesion, the lesions range from <30% of the lung area (Common type), 30–50% (Severe type), and> 50% (Critical type). At the first CT exam, 136 cases (50.37%) of the common type, 89 cases (32.96%) of the severe type and 45 cases (16.67%) of the critical type. At the second CT exam, 84 cases (31.11%) of the common type, 103 cases (38.15%) of the severe type and 83 cases (30.74%) of the critical type. In the third CT exam, there were 151 cases (55.93%) of the common type, 86 cases (31.85%) of the severe type and 33 cases (12.22%) of the critical type. The differences in image typing were statistically significant (P < 0.05). During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. Conclusion: In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.",High Resolution CT Imaging Dynamic Follow-Up Study of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
"OBJECTIVES The adoption of laparoscopy for the Whipple procedure remains limited in part by its technical difficulty. We sought to develop a superior, simpler pancreaticojejunostomy technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We applied a running barbed suture (V-Loc™; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to perform the pancreaticojejunostomy over a stent placed in the pancreatic duct and a small enterotomy in the jejunum. This technique was attempted in the last 19 of 37 patients presenting to two surgeons (M.A.M. and B.H.E.) for a laparoscopic Whipple procedure. Data were collected on operative time, pancreatic leak events, and related complications. RESULTS We successfully applied the modified technique in all 19 patients. Pancreatic leak occurred in 5% of patients with the modified technique (Grade A=0; Grade B=1; Grade C=0) and 11% with the standard technique (Grade A=1; Grade B=1; Grade C=0). All leaks were managed with external drainage. There were no leak-related complications. Mean operative time was shorter for the modified technique (mean, 367 minutes; range, 260-576 minutes) than the standard technique (mean, 440 minutes; range, 300-665 minutes). CONCLUSIONS The use of a running barbed suture for laparoscopic pancreaticojejunostomy is a safe and efficient technique. Our operative times were decreased with this technique, and our outcomes were similar to other laparoscopic Whipple series.",Laparoscopic pancreaticojejunostomy using a barbed suture: a novel technique.
"In December 2019, the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization first reported on a cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause. Nine months later more than 1.4 million people have died from COVID 19. In this work, the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on five nursing homes in Austria, which cared for 889 residents in the first half of 2020, were examined. The research question was whether the measures taken were appropriate to prevent an outbreak within the individual facilities. To detect previously unrecognized infections, the present study evaluated the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in residents and employees of the nursing homes. Following the analysis of blood samples, the prospectively collected data was connected to data from screening examinations and data from contact tracing. The present study demonstrated an overall prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nursing homes of 3.7%. Whereas the prevalence in those facilities that have never been hit by an outbreak is 0%, the prevalence in those facilities with an outbreak is up to 4.9%. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 35 persons. A retrospective analysis of all 5 included nursing homes demonstrated that upon regular clinical screening in combination with PCRs an infection with SARS-COV-2 was detected in 66 residents and 24 employees from different professional groups. In only 25 of the 35 persons with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 an infection was proven in advance. This study suggests that specific measures can prevent transmission within a health care facility. Nevertheless, the results also show that a risk reduction to 0% cannot be achieved. In preparation for further pandemic waves there is still the need to reduce the probability of a transmission in nursing homes with specific test strategies.",Can We Protect Those We Care for in A Pandemic? - Prevalence of Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes
"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) is challenging among hospitalized older adults, particularly among those with altered mental status. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) for UTI in hospitalized older adults. DESIGN: We performed a prospective cohort study of older adults (≥65 years old) admitted to a single hospital with evidence of pyuria on urinalysis. PCT was tested on initial blood samples. The reference standard was a clinical definition that included the presence of a positive urine culture and any symptom or sign of infection referable to the genitourinary tract. We also surveyed the treating physicians for their clinical judgment and performed expert adjudication of cases for the determination of UTI. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-nine study participants at a major academic medical center. MAIN MEASURES: We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of PCT for the diagnosis of UTI. KEY RESULTS: In this study cohort, 61 (27%) participants met clinical criteria for UTI. The median age of the overall cohort was 82.6 (IQR 74.9–89.7) years. The AUC of PCT for the diagnosis of UTI was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.46–0.65). A series of sensitivity analyses on UTI definition, which included using a decreased threshold for bacteriuria, the treating physicians’ clinical judgment, and independent infectious disease specialist adjudication, confirmed the negative result. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that PCT has limited value in the diagnosis of UTI among hospitalized older adults. Clinicians should be cautious using PCT for the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older adults.

"In this perspective, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis (TB)/HIV health services and approaches to mitigating the growing burden of these three colliding epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.","Minimizing the impact of the triple burden of COVID-19, tuberculosis and HIV on health services in sub-Saharan Africa"
"Vigorously developing high-tech industry has been considered to be an effective way to coordinate economic growth with excessive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, previous studies have not explored the heterogeneous impacts of high-tech industry on CO2 emissions in regions with different levels of high-tech industry development, and not distinguished the direct and indirect impacts. Based on STIRPAT model, this study investigates the impacts of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions in China between 2005 and 2016. Adopting the K-medians cluster method, effects in regions with high, middle, and low levels of high-tech industry development are considered. Indirect effects of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions by affecting industry structure upgrades and economic growth are explored. Empirical results illustrate a positive U-shaped nonlinear link between the level of high-tech industry development and CO2 emissions at the national level and regional (high, middle, and low) level. In terms of indirect impacts, high-tech industry development attenuates the reduction of CO2 emissions due to industry structure upgrades, and promotes economic growth to increase CO2 emissions slightly. The indirect impact intensity gradually decreases as the level of high-tech industry development decreases across three regions. Reasonable implications of our findings are proposed.",Direct and indirect impacts of high-tech industry development on CO2 emissions: empirical evidence from China
"Patients are required to be observed and treated continually in some emergency situations. However, due to time constraints, visiting the hospital to execute such tasks is challenging. This can be achieved using a remote healthcare monitoring system. The proposed system introduces an effective data science technique for IoT supported healthcare monitoring system with the rapid adoption of cloud computing that enhances the efficiency of data processing and the accessibility of data in the cloud. Many IoT sensors are employed, which collect real healthcare data. These data are retained in the cloud for the processing of data science. In the Healthcare Monitoring-Data Science Technique (HM-DST), initially, an altered data science technique is introduced. This algorithm is known as the Improved Pigeon Optimization (IPO) algorithm, which is employed for grouping the stored data in the cloud, which helps in improving the prediction rate. Next, the optimum feature selection technique for extraction and selection of features is illustrated. A Backtracking Search-Based Deep Neural Network (BS-DNN) is utilized for classifying human healthcare. The proposed system's performance is finally examined with various healthcare datasets of real time and the variations are observed with the available smart healthcare systems for monitoring.",An Effective Data Science Technique for IoT-Assisted Healthcare Monitoring System with a Rapid Adoption of Cloud Computing
"Objective: Mortality rates of COVID-19 are higher among the elderly. Curfews have been imposed on individuals aged 65 and older to reduce contact with other people. We aimed to determine anxiety and loneliness levels and associated factors of individuals aged 65 and over in-home quarantine. Method: We determined sociodemographic, clinical features, information status on COVID-19 pandemic, geriatric anxiety scale and loneliness scale for the elderly values of 290 individuals (65- 90 years old) in Turkey. Results: The mean age was 71.2+/-5.9 years, and 54.8% were male(n: 159). 87.6% followed COVID-19 process, and 88.3% received the information from the television. 14.1% reported significant worries about the individuals in their family, 14.1% about their social life, and 19.7% about their economic situation. A statistically significant relationship was observed between the geriatric anxiety and the loneliness scale(r: 0.498, p: 0.001). Anxiety scores were increased 1.29 fold by loneliness scores, 3.56 fold by having a chronic disease and 3.26 fold by the history of a psychiatric disorder. Discussion: We suggest that quarantine increases anxiety and loneliness levels in geriatric population with a positive correlation between anxiety and loneliness levels. Having a chronic disease and History of a psychiatric disorder was also associated with anxiety levels. The majority of concerns is about their family members, future social and economic lives. It has been observed that television has become an essential source of information in the pandemic for the geriatric population.

"BACKGROUND: A community lockdown has a profound impact on its citizens. Our objective was to identify changes in trauma patient demographics, volume, and pattern of injury following the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted at a Level-1 Trauma Center from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: A downward trend in volume is seen December–April in 2020 (R(2) = 0.9907). February through April showed an upward trend in 2018 and 2019 (R(2=) 0.80 and R(2) = 0.90 respectively), but a downward trend in 2020 (R(2) = 0.97). In April 2020, there was 41.6% decrease in total volume, a 47.4% decrease in blunt injury and no decrease in penetrating injury. In contrast to previous months, in April the majority of injuries occurred in home zip codes. CONCLUSIONS: A community lockdown decreased the number of blunt trauma, however despite social distancing, did not decrease penetrating injury. Injuries were more likely to occur in home zip codes.","Changes in trends during the COVID-19 lockdown: An urban, Level-1 trauma centers experience"
"Objective: Gun violence is a pressing public health concern, particularly in the United States. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a record-breaking year with 43,551 deaths attributed to gun violence in the U.S., with almost 20,000 classified as murder/unintentional death and more than 24,000 classified as suicide (Gun Violence Archive, 2021). Black men are 10 times more likely to die from gun violence than are white men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020c). Yet, in proportion to these sobering statistics, researchers' knowledge of the range of causes and possible remedies remains negligible. The purpose of this Special Issue of the Psychology of Violence devoted to Gun Violence was to highlight and spur additional, psychologically oriented research regarding firearm violence. Method: This Special Issue consists of seven original U.S.-based studies that address various aspects of gun violence, including individual, geographical, psychological, and sociological factors associated with attitudes toward guns, gun policies, and gun violence. Results: Individually and collectively, these studies provide novel insights regarding different types of gun perceptions and beliefs. These works consider a wide range of factors including media exposure, beliefs about the link between mental illness and gun violence, cumulative trauma, masculinity norms, regional norms, and trust in law enforcement. Discussion: This Special Issue is intended to spark greater interest in working to mitigate firearm violence and encourage researchers across scientific disciplines to collaboratively apply their theoretical perspectives and methodologies to reduce the devastating, but understudied, U.S. gun violence epidemic.

"There is currently no approved pharmaceutical product for the treatment of COVID-19. However, antibiotics are currently being used for the management of COVID-19 patients in many settings either treat to co-infections or for the treatment of COVID-19 itself. In this commentary, we highlight that the increased rates of antimicrobial prescribing for COVID-19 patients could further worsen the burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We also highlight that though AMR is a global threat, Africa tends to suffer most from the consequences. We, therefore, call on African countries not to lose sight of the possible implications of the treatment of COVID-19 on AMR and a need to redouble efforts towards the fight against AMR while dealing with the pandemic.",Treatment of COVID-19: implications for antimicrobial resistance in Africa
"Medical education, research, and health care practice continue to grow with minimal coproduction guidance. We suggest the Commons Principle approach to medical education as modeled by Ostrom and Williamson, where we share how adapting these models to multiple settings can enhance empathy, increase psychological safety, and provide robust just-in-time learning tools for practice. We here describe patient and public coproduction in diverse areas within health care using the commons philosophy across populations, cultures, and generations with learning examples across age groups and cultures. We further explore descriptive, mixed methods participatory action in medical and research education. We adopt an “Everyone Included” perspective and sought to identify its use in continuing medical education, citizen science, marginalized groups, publishing, and student internships. Overall, we outline coproduction at the point of need, as we report on strategies that improved engagement. This work demonstrates coproduction with the public across multiple settings and cultures, showing that even with minimal resources and experience, this partnership can improve medical education and care.","Coproduction, Coeducation, and Patient Involvement: Everyone Included Framework for Medical Education Across Age Groups and Cultures"
"Many living organisms respond to pandemics using strategies such as isolation. This is true, for example, of social insects, for whom the spread of disease can pose a high risk to colony survival. In light of such behaviors, the present study investigated a different way of developing strategies to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, we considered the strategies ants use to handle epidemics and limit disease spread within colonies. To enhance our understanding of these strategies, we explored ants' social systems and how they specifically respond to infectious diseases. The early warning threshold system reflects the importance of building mechanisms and making early decisions to enable appropriate actions to be taken to control the spread of disease and develop alternative plans. Determining thresholds is a complex process with several factors related to decision-making. For example, reliable warnings about pathogens among ants require the defense system to allocate more members to more valuable resources. The effectiveness of ants' disease-control strategies is rooted in behaviors such as social coordination between members, organizational immunity, disease-outbreak reduction, behavioral plasticity, and risk-threshold determination. Understanding such behaviors among ants could inspire the development of new strategies for limiting the spread of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics.",Strategies for Reducing the Spread of COVID-19 Based on an Ant-Inspired Framework
"BACKGROUND AND AIM: As recently outlined in the WHO-ECDC Indicator framework to evaluate the public health effectiveness of digital proximity tracing solutions, one of the main barriers to digital contact tracing (DCT) is population acceptance, which, in turns, is influenced by digital literacy, attitudes and practice. DCT came to public prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence on its population acceptance have not been comprehensively analyzed. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42021253668) following the PRISMA guidelines. Original studies reporting on different measures of population DCT acceptance were included. RESULTS: The systematic review was based on 41 articles meeting our a priori defined inclusion criteria, comprising aa total of 186144 surveyed subjects, 50000 tweets, 5025 Reddit posts and 714 written comments. Data extraction and synthesis required qualitative outcome grouping, performed ex-post, in 14 different benchmarks components. They constitute a narrative analysis of actionable points for public health policy. CONCLUSION: Population acceptance is a key component of DCT effective adoption and, ultimately, infection control during infectious diseases outbreaks. Assessing DCT acceptance’s determinants in different settings, populations and cultural contexts it is of fundamental importance to inform the planning, implementation and monitoring of public health interventions. The results of our in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis should guide future research aimed at exploring how digitalization can serve people-centred care.

"In August 2020-2021, symptoms of leaf spot were observed in luffa (Luffa cylindrical) fields in Qingdao city, Shandong Province. In all the 10 fields investigated, leaf spot occurred. The incidence (% luffa plants with symptoms from a defined number of plants assessed) was 35 to 60%. Early symptoms of infected leaves were small and irregular chlorotic lesions which later became irregular brown spots. As the disease progressed, the lesions gradually spread from the edge to the center of leaves to the middle, and became dark brown. The enlarged spots coalesced and eventually led to the withering and death of the leaves. In order to isolate the pathogen, 30 symptomatic leaves were collected from different planting fields. Small pieces of leaf tissues (5×5 mm) were cut from the junction of healthy and diseased tissues, sanitized with 2% NaClO for 1 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. The tissue samples were then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 50 mg/L streptomycin sulfate, and incubated at 28℃ for 5 days in the dark. Ten purified fungal isolates were obtained by single spore isolation method. Colonies of these fungal isolates on the PDA medium were initially grayish-white, and then turned olive green with abundant cotton-like aerial hyphae. On potato carrot agar (PCA) medium, these fungi produced light brown and solitary conidiophore with septum. Conidia were obclavate or ellipsoid, brown, with 1-5 transverse septa and 0-3 longitudinal septa, and measured 13.2 to 49.5 × 9.5 to 21.6 µm (n=50). The morphological characteristics of these isolates were consistent with that of Alternaria spp. (Simmons 2007). The representative isolate NEAU-SG-1 was selected for molecular identification. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF), histone 3 (HIS3), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) were amplified using primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), gpd1/gpd2 (Berbee et al. 1999), EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), H3-1a/H3-1b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and RPB2-5F2/fRPB2-7cR (Sung et al. 2007), respectively. Sequences of these genes of isolate NEAU-SG-1 were deposited into GenBank database with the accession numbers of OL307719, OL415166, OL415169, OL415167, and OL415168. BLAST analysis of these sequences showed 99-100% homology with sequence homology with Alternaria tenuissima strains (ITS, MH824269; GAPDH, MK683783; TEF, MN056178; HIS3, MH824371; RPB2, LC621694). To fulfill Koch's postulates, ten surface disinfected 30-day-old luffa seedlings were inoculated by spraying conidia suspension (106 conidia/ml) of isolate NEAU-SG-1. The other ten surface disinfected seedlings inoculated with sterile distilled water served as the control group. After inoculation, each plant was covered with plastic bags for three days and cultured in greenhouse at 25℃. One week later, leaves inoculated with conidia suspension were observed with the same symptoms as described above, while the leaves of the control group were asymptomatic. Pathogenicity test was repeated twice. The Alternaria isolates were successfully re-isolated from those infected leaves and identified using the morphological and molecular methods described above. A. tenuissima has a wide host range in the world, and is the pathogen of leaf spot of many crops (Ma et al. 2021). To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. tenuissima causing leaf spot on luffa in China. This report will provide basic information for the diagnosis and prevention and control strategies of luffa leaf spot.",First Report of Alternaria tenuissima Causing Leaf spot on Luffa cylindrica in China.

"We developed an agent-based stochastic model, based on P Systems methodology, to decipher the effects of vaccination and contact tracing on the control of COVID-19 outbreak at population level under different control measures (social distancing, mask wearing and hand hygiene) and epidemiological scenarios Our findings suggest that without the application of protection social measures, 56 1% of the Spanish population would contract the disease with a mortality of 0 4% Assuming that 20% of the population was protected by vaccination by the end of the summer of 2021, it would be expected that 45% of the population would contract the disease and 0 3% of the population would die However, both of these percentages are significantly lower when social measures were adopted, being the best results when social measures are in place and 40% of contacts traced Our model shows that if 40% of the population can be vaccinated, even without social control measures, the percentage of people who die or recover from infection would fall from 0 41% and 56 1% to 0 16% and 33 5%, respectively compared with an unvaccinated population When social control measures were applied in concert with vaccination the percentage of people who die or recover from infection diminishes until 0 10% and 14 5%, after vaccinating 40% of the population Vaccination alone can be crucial in controlling this disease, but it is necessary to vaccinate a significant part of the population and to back this up with social control measures",Modeling of Vaccination and Contact Tracing as Tools to Control the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain
"The COVID-19 pandemic affected millions of people globally with lasting effects on society, patients, investigators and health institutions. Clinical trials, our best tool to improve cancer treatment for patients through testing the clinical value of a new treatment, have been affected by the pandemic. The pandemic footprint represents both a risk of compromising development of new therapies and an opportunity to elicit discussion over a portfolio of broader reforms, applicable irrespective of pandemics, in order to improve the design and implementation of clinical trials in oncology. The administrative load should be reduced, without affecting the quality of research and principles of good clinical practice. Cancer centres are encouraged to adapt their research/operational structures to the requirements of molecular oncology and embrace novel trial designs. Technological and methodological leaps in telemedicine can convert physical to virtual visits while routine examinations may be performed in local institutions (co-research centres), maintaining adherence to good clinical and research practices.

"Current knowledge on the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) indicates its central role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular remodelling via both hemodynamic alterations and direct growth and the proliferation effects of angiotensin II or aldosterone resulting in the hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, the proliferation of fibroblasts, and inflammatory immune cell activation. The noncoding regulatory microRNAs has recently emerged as a completely novel approach to the study of the RAS. A growing number of microRNAs serve as mediators and/or regulators of RAS-induced cardiac remodelling by directly targeting RAS enzymes, receptors, signalling molecules, or inhibitors of signalling pathways. Specifically, microRNAs that directly modulate pro-hypertrophic, pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory signalling initiated by angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) stimulation are of particular relevance in mediating the cardiovascular effects of the RAS. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge in the field that is still in the early stage of preclinical investigation with occasionally conflicting reports.

MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.1 cells. Both strains produced titers of 106 TCID50/ml in subsequent passages in J774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.1 cells. Therefore J774A.1 cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.1 cells, MHV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17C1-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 1469), though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay. Infant mouse bioassays, plaque assays and cell culture infections were compared for their sensitivity in detecting MHV-Y in infected intestinal homogenates and cell supernatants.",Optimization of in vitro growth conditions for enterotropic murine coronavirus strains
"INTRODUCTION Repetitive peripheral sensory stimulation (RPSS) followed by 4-hour task-specific training (TST) improves upper limb motor function in subjects with stroke who experience moderate to severe motor upper limb impairments. Here, we compared effects of RPSS vs sham followed by a shorter duration of training in subjects with moderate to severe motor impairments in the chronic phase after stroke. METHODS This single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial compared effects of 18 sessions of either 1.5 h of active RPSS or sham followed by a supervised session that included 45 min of TST of the paretic upper limb. In both groups, subjects were instructed to perform functional tasks at home, without supervision. The primary outcome measure was the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) after 6 weeks of treatment. Grasp and pinch strength were secondary outcomes. RESULTS In intention-to-treat analysis, WMFT improved significantly in both active and sham groups at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. Grasp strength improved significantly in the active, but not in the sham group, at 3 and 6 weeks. Pinch strength improved significantly in both groups at 3 weeks, and only in the active group at 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS The between-group difference in changes in WMFT was not statistically significant. Despite the short duration of supervised treatment, WMFT improved significantly in subjects treated with RPSS or sham. These findings are relevant to settings that impose constraints in duration of direct contact between therapists and patients. In addition, RPSS led to significant gains in hand strength.Trial Registry Name: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation and Motor Training in Stroke Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT0265878 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02658578.",Repetitive Peripheral Sensory Stimulation as an Add-On Intervention for Upper Limb Rehabilitation in Stroke: A Randomized Trial.
"Adaptin proteins (APs) play a crucial role in intracellular cell trafficking. The ‘classical’ role of APs is carried out by AP1‒3, which bind to clathrin, cargo, and accessory proteins. Accordingly, AP1–3 are crucial for both vesicle formation and sorting. All APs consist of four subunits that are indispensable for their functions. In fact, based on studies using cells, model organism knockdown/knock-out, and human variants, each subunit plays crucial roles and contributes to the specificity of each AP. These studies also revealed that the sorting and intracellular trafficking function of AP can exert varying effects on pathology by controlling features such as cell development, signal transduction related to the apoptosis and proliferation pathways in cancer cells, organelle integrity, receptor presentation, and viral infection. Although the roles and functions of AP1‒3 are relatively well studied, the functions of the less abundant and more recently identified APs, AP4 and AP5, are still to be investigated. Further studies on these APs may enable a better understanding and targeting of specific diseases. APs known or suggested locations and functions.",Role of adaptin protein complexes in intracellular trafficking and their impact on diseases
"This study evaluates the extent to which COVID-19 vaccination affects population mental health. Exploiting the within-state and within-survey week variation in the number fully vaccinated per 10 million people, I uncover the favorable effects of vaccination on individuals' psychological well-being. Particularly, a 100% increase in the number fully vaccinated per 10 million people makes individuals 0.24, 0.23, 0.12, and 0.14 percentage points less likely to experience anxiety, worry, displeasure, and depression on a daily basis, respectively. The probability of having at least one of the four symptoms (anxiety, worry, displeasure, and depression) every day also reduces by 0.27 percentage points. The study calls for the expansion of vaccine coverage, especially for disproportionately affected communities.",The Psychological Benefits of COVID-19 Vaccination
"BACKGROUND In 1998, an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing (EBVS) system was introduced and quickly became an integral component of the surgical armamentarium in various surgical specialties. Currently available EBVS instruments use a scissor-like jaw configuration and closing mechanism, which causes decreasing compression pressure from the proximal to the distal end of the jaws. A new EBVS system is described here which utilizes a different instrument jaw configuration and closing mechanism to enable a more homogeneous pressure distribution despite longer instrument jaws. METHODS Results of jaw pressure distribution measurements as well as sealing experiments with subsequent burst pressure measurements ex vivo on bovine uterine arteries are demonstrated. Furthermore, an in vivo evaluation of the new EBVS system in a canine and porcine model including histological examination is presented. RESULTS The device revealed an even pressure distribution throughout the whole jaw length. The ex vivo burst pressure measurements revealed high average burst pressures, above 300 mmHg, independent of the outer diameter (1 to 7 mm) of the tested vessels. Histological evaluation of sealed vessels 21 days postoperatively demonstrated sealed and fused vessels without adjacent tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS The even pressure distribution leading to a sufficient tissue sealing in combination with the novel closing mechanism and extended jaw length differentiates the novel device from other available EBVS systems. This might offer a reduction of the overall procedure time, which should be further evaluated in a clinical study.","Rationale, bench testing and in vivo evaluation of a novel 5 mm laparoscopic vessel sealing device with homogeneous pressure distribution in long instrument jaws."
"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial public health burden and widespread anxiety. The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.",How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms?

"Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China causing severe respiratory infections and resulting in millions admissions to hospital and over a million deaths worldwide. Authorities imposed protective measures including confinement to flatten curves of casualties resulted in sudden lifestyle and eating habit changes. The objectives of this study were to observe the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on eating behavior and lifestyle of the Kurdish population in Iraqi Kurdistan. A structured cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st to 14th of June when the lockdown finished with three different sections. Section one (6 questions) included socio-demographic information section two (11 questions) composed of dietary behavior information including a) Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence using 14-scaled items with a MD screener tool ranging from 0 to 14 b) and sections three (12 questions) composed of lifestyle habit changes such as physical activity, sleeping behavior, and smoking habit. The total number of included respondents was 2,137. The results showed that 12.0% (256) of participants stated that their lifestyle was improved, whereas 50.9% (1,087) declared their lifestyle deteriorated. In particular, the frequency of physical activity was decreased (McNemar value = 60.53, p <.001) and sleeping hours were significantly increased during lockdown (McNemar value = 447.93, p <.001). Regarding eating habits, it was noticed that 29.3% and 14.3% felt that appetite increased and decreased, respectively. The appetite change during lockdown was significantly associated with age (p =.0001), gender (p =.001), city (p =.007), and BMI (p =.001). Similarly, 32.4% reported weight gain. In conclusion, this study is among the earliest studies showing the effect of COVID-19 on eating behavior and lifestyle changes. COVID-19 confinement had a significant effect on lifestyle particularly reducing physical activity and changing eating habits.",The impact of COVID-19 confinement on the eating habits and lifestyle changes: A cross sectional study
"Pulmonary diseases are currently one of the major threats of human health, especially considering the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current treatments are facing the challenges like insufficient local drug concentrations, the fast lung clearance and risks to induce unexpected inflammation.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause gastrointestinal symptoms in the patients, but the role of gut microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Thus, in this study, we aim to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the composition and function of gut microbiota. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that significant shifts in microbiome composition and function were appeared in both SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. The relative abundance of Candidatus_Saccharibacteria was significantly increased, whereas the levels of Fibrobacteres was remarkably reduced in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases. There was one bacterial species, Spirochaetes displayed the difference between patients and asymptomatic cases. On the genus level, Tyzzerella was the key species that remarkably increased in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Analyses of genome annotations further revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in the significant ‘functional dysbiosis’ of gut microbiota, including metabolic pathway, regulatory pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites etc. We also identified potential metagenomic markers to discriminate SARS-CoV-2-infected symptomatic and asymptomatic cases from healthy controls. These findings together suggest gut microbiota is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Distinct Metagenomic Signatures in the SARS-CoV-2 Infection
"During pandemic events, strategies such as social distancing can be fundamental to curb viral spreading. Such actions can reduce the number of simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading, which is relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be suggested, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the disease risk. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated, avoiding unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic individual quarantine strategies, intending to combine in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. The disease spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in previous epidemic scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.",An epidemiological model with voluntary quarantine strategies governed by evolutionary game dynamics
"Purpose>COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the well-being and the psychological resilience of different populations, particularly in the addiction field. This study aims to assess anxiety and its severity among patients and staff from different types of addiction services in Israel during this emergency.Design/methodology/approach>The study was conducted during the period from March–July 2020. Participants included patients and staff (N = 282) from three different types of addiction services, were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the multi-dimensional scale of perceived social support and demographic variables. In addition, a logistic regression model was applied to identify predictors of state anxiety by using statistical package for the social sciences software.Findings>The results show that therapeutic communities clients reported more social support compared to other subjects. State anxiety has a positive strong correlation with trait anxiety both among patients and staff, and it was found as a crucial predictor of state anxiety in the regression equation. There is no statistically significant correlation between state anxiety and social support, gender or education among clients and staff as one. The state anxiety remains relatively stable and characterizes most people, staff and patients, men and women, medical staff members and other professionals.Research limitations/implications>The current study has some contributions to the addiction field by understanding the psychological distress of a vulnerable population: substance users in treatment settings. The study population relied on convenient samples and future studies should be planned using a cross-sectional design and should take into account substance use measures. The findings are reinforcing the assumption that state anxiety was likely to increase during the coronavirus pandemic.Practical implications>Adequate services should be planned to avoid relapse or mental deterioration of people who use drugs during health emergencies.Originality/value>The research points out the unique and real difficulties of SUD clients, as well as the complexity and risks in their staff members’ works.

"Potent neutralizing antibodies (Abs) have been proven with therapeutic efficacy for the intervention against SARS-CoV-2. Majority of these Abs function by directly interfering with the virus entry to host cells. Here, we identified a receptor binding domain (RBD) specific monoclonal Ab (mAb) 82A6 with efficient neutralizing potency against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. As most Abs targeting the non-receptor binding motif (RBM) region, 82A6 was incapable to block the RBD-ACE2 interaction. In particular, it actively promoted the S1 subunit shedding from the S protein, which may lead to effective reduction of intact SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Importantly, it could block potential syncytia formation associated with post-infectious cell surface expression of S proteins. Our study evidenced a RBD specific Ab with unique beneficial efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might bring informative significance to understand the collective effects of neutralizing Abs elicited in COVID-19 patients.",A non-RBM targeted RBD specific antibody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 inducing S1 shedding
"The use of the Internet and social networks have increased dramatically during the COVID quarantine mainly because several activities were moved online. In education, numerous stakeholders stayed at home and their academic plans were modified and adapted to an entire virtual environment. This was the case of a live event (Science Café) whose purpose was to disseminate knowledge through Facebook and YouTube. Thus, this study aimed at verifying if there was knowledge construction in social networks through user interactions by using 1,083 comments posted by the audience. Comments were coded according to validated frameworks for language taxonomy and collaborative knowledge construction. Results show that the predominant interaction is that in which viewers pose questions to speakers. Our analyses also revealed that attendees hardly reached the highest levels of knowledge construction through unguided interaction. Often, user interactions went beyond emotional expressions towards evaluation and therefore, could reach a higher level of knowledge construction. This study shows that social networks may offer informal spaces for deliberation and collaborative interaction with the potential to support learning if guided properly. This research aims to contribute empirical evidence to the growing body of literature that online interactions in informal environments may provide productive learning.",Informal Learning in Social Networks During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Empirical Analysis
"In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People’s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.","Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections"
"Prices send signals about consumer preferences and thus stimulate producers to make more of what people want. Pricing in a pandemic is complicated and fraught. The policy puzzle involves balancing lower prices to ensure access to essential medications, vaccines, and tests, and adequate revenue streams to provide manufacturers incentives to make the substantial, risky investments needed to develop products in the first place. We review alternative pricing strategies (cost-recovery models, monetary prizes, advanced market commitments) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. Hybrid pricing strategies are undoubtedly needed in a pandemic, but even in a public health crisis, value-based pricing is important. Cost-effectiveness analyses can inform pricing. Ideally, analyses would be conducted from both a health system and societal perspective. Incorporating the added value of social benefits into cost effectiveness analyses doesn't mean manufacturers should capture the entire societal benefit of a diagnostic, vaccine, or therapy. Such analyses can provide important information and help policy makers consider the full costs and benefits of products and the wide-ranging ramifications of their actions.

The final edited version will appear in an upcoming issue of Health Affairs.].","Consideration Of Value-Based Pricing For Treatments And Vaccines Is Important, Even In The COVID-19 Pandemic"
"PURPOSE: To promote well-being, healthcare education programs have incorporated mindfulness-based skills and principles into existing curriculums. Pandemic-related restrictions have compelled programs to deliver content virtually. Study objectives were to determine (1) whether teaching mindfulness-based skills within physician assistant (PA) programs can promote well-being and (2) whether delivery type (virtual vs. in-person) can impact the effectiveness. METHODS: During this 2-year study, a brief mindfulness-based curriculum was delivered to incoming first-year students at six PA programs, while students at two programs served as controls. The curriculum was delivered in-person in year one and virtually in year two. Validated pre- and post-test survey items assessed mindfulness (decentering ability, present moment attention and awareness, and psychological flexibility) and well-being (perceived stress and life satisfaction). RESULTS: As expected, coping abilities and well-being were adversely impacted by educational demands. The mindfulness-based curriculum intervention was effective in increasing mindfulness and life satisfaction, while decreasing perceived stress when delivered in-person. Virtual curricular delivery was effective in decreasing perceived stress but not improving life satisfaction. Over half of the participants receiving the curriculum reported positive changes on mindfulness measures with approximately 14–38% reporting a change of greater than one standard deviation. Changes on mindfulness measures explained 30–38% of the reported changes in perceived stress and 22–26% of the changes in life satisfaction. Therefore, the mindfulness curriculum demonstrated statistically significant improvements in measures of mindfulness and mitigated declines in life satisfaction and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based skills effectively taught in-person or virtually within PA programs successfully promote well-being.",Comparing the Effectiveness of Virtual and In-Person Delivery of Mindfulness-Based Skills Within Healthcare Curriculums
"BACKGROUND: Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus share similarities such as clinical features and outcome, laboratory, and radiological findings. METHODS: Literature search was done using PubMed to find MEDLINE indexed articles relevant to this study. As of 25 November 2020, the search has been conducted by combining the MeSH words ""COVID-19"" and ""Influenza"". RESULTS: Eighteen articles were finally selected in adult patients. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients, while pulmonary diseases and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza patients. The incidence rates of fever, vomiting, ocular and otorhinolaryngological symptoms were found to be significantly higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19 patients. However, neurologic symptoms and diarrhea were statistically more frequent in COVID-19 patients. The level of white cell count and procalcitonin was significantly higher in influenza patients, whereas thrombopenia and elevated transaminases were significantly more common in COVID-19 patients. Ground-grass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and a peripheral distribution were more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients where consolidations and linear opacities were described instead. COVID-19 patients were significantly more often transferred to intensive care unit with a higher rate of mortality.

"BACKGROUND: Caregivers often use the internet to access information related to stroke care to improve preparedness, thereby reducing uncertainty and enhancing the quality of care. METHOD: Social media communities used by caregivers of people affected by stroke were identified using popular keywords searched for using Google. Communities were filtered based on their ability to provide support to caregivers. Data from the included communities were extracted and analysed to determine the content and level of interaction. RESULTS: There was a significant rise in the use of social media by caregivers of people affected by stroke. The most popular social media communities were charitable and governmental organizations with the highest user interaction–this was for topics related to stroke prevention, signs and symptoms, and caregiver self-care delivered through video-based resources. CONCLUSION: Findings show the ability of social media to support stroke caregiver needs and practices that should be considered to increase their interaction and support.",Utilization of social media communities for caregiver information support in stroke recovery: An analysis of content and interactions
"COVID-19 has led to long overdue visibility of the gendered determinants and impacts of health emergencies and global health security. This article explores why gender was neglected in previous health emergencies, what led to change in visibility of gender issues during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implications of such change for understanding the relationship between gender and global health security. The article explores the question of neglect by drawing on original research into the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, its aftermath and implications for future pandemic preparedness. The article then looks in detail at the research efforts, funding, epistemic community activism and impact of COVID-19 to explain why gender received high profile political attention and acknowledgment. The article argues that the change in visibility, research and advocacy around gender equality during the COVID-19 outbreak does not demonstrate an advancement in gender equality in global health. To the contrary, such visibility reinforces the inherent problems of global health security evident in the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak that create and reproduce binaries of neglect and visibility, and hierarchies of the global health issues that matter, the people that matter and the women that matter. What unites neglect and visibility of gender in global health security is that gender is understood as solution rather than threat. Combined these factors make gender equality incompatible with global health security.

"In this study, the cytokine profiles of clinically healthy cats naturally infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV), of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and of specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats were investigated in whole blood using a traditional reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and a semi-quantitative method of analysis based on computerised quantification of positive bands. The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease. This hypothesis was also supported by the low levels of IFN-γ recorded in blood from cats with FIP.",Whole blood cytokine profiles in cats infected by feline coronavirus and healthy non-FCoV infected specific pathogen-free cats
"Background: Little research has examined the impact of working within the context of COVID-19 on UK healthcare professionals (HCPs) mental health and well-being, despite previous pandemic findings indicating that HCPs are particularly vulnerable to suffering PTSD and other mental health difficulties due to the nature of healthcare work. Specifically, it appears that no research has employed qualitative methodologies to explore the effects of working amidst COVID-19 on mental health for HCPs in the UK. Objective: To qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one centred on specific challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic, such as redeployment, isolation from loved ones, infection concerns, lack of PPE and impact on patient interpersonal care. Theme two offered insights into the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs, while many experienced feelings of fear, sadness and hypervigilance, all also demonstrated a marked resilience. Finally, many felt undervalued and misunderstood, and wished to press upon the general public seriousness of the disease.

"We studied the immunogenicity of an anti-SARS subunit vaccine comprised of the fragment of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein amino acids 318–510 (S318–510) containing the receptor-binding domain. The S protein fragment was purified from the culture supernatant of stably transformed HEK293T cells secreting a tagged version of the protein. The vaccine was given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice in saline, with alum adjuvant or with alum plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Mice immunized with the adjuvanted antigen elicited strong antibody and cellular immune responses; furthermore, adding the CpG ODN to the alum resulted in increased IgG2a antibody titers and a higher number of INF-γ-secreting murine splenocytes. Mice vaccinated with S318–510 deglycosylated by PNGase F (dgS318–510) showed a lower neutralizing antibody response but had similar numbers of INF-γ-producing cells in the spleen. This finding suggests that carbohydrate is important for the immunogenicity of the S318–510 protein fragment and provide useful information for designing an effective and safe SARS subunit vaccine.",Immunogenicity of a receptor-binding domain of SARS coronavirus spike protein in mice: Implications for a subunit vaccine
"BACKGROUND: Thromboembolism and bleeding contribute to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)'s morbidity and mortality and are also frequent complications of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO). As the interaction of the underlying pathologies caused by vvECMO in COVID-19 is barely understood, we designed this study to better differentiate coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients before, during and after vvECMO-support. METHODS: Observational case series, six consecutive patients with Coronavirus acute respiratory distress syndrome supported with vvECMO treated in the anaesthesiologic ICU in a third level University ECMO-centre. We measured routine coagulation parameters and assessed coagulation factors. We also conducted advanced von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer analysis, platelet aggregometry and immunological screening. RESULTS: We identified various phases of coagulation disorders: Initially, intensely activated coagulation with highly increased VWF and factor VIII activity in acute COVID-19, then severe acquired von Willebrand syndrome and platelet dysfunction during vvECMO leading to spontaneous bleeding and finally, hypercoagulopathy after vvECMO explantation. Five of six patients developed immunological abnormalities enhancing coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus-induced coagulopathy and bleeding disorders during vvECMO cannot be discriminated via 'routine' coagulation tests. Precise and specific analyses followed by the appropriate treatment of coagulation disorders may help us develop tailored therapeutic concepts to better manage the phases described above.","Hypercoagulopathy, acquired coagulation disorders and anticoagulation before, during and after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in COVID-19: a case series"

"Interleukin-12 is a lymphokine that triggers gamma interferon secretion by various cells and differentiation of T-helper lymphocytes towards the Th1 subtype. Since viruses are potent inducers of gamma interferon production and elicit immune responses most probably mediated by Th1 cells, like B-cell immunoglobulin G2a secretion, we analyzed interleukin-12 message expression after infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and mouse adenovirus. Our results indicated that the message for the p40 component of interleukin-12 was transiently increased shortly after infection. Interleukin-12 was expressed mainly by macrophages. Therefore, production of interleukin-12 might constitute the initial event that would determine the subsequent characteristics of the immune response elicited by viral infections.",Interleukin-12 gene expression after viral infection in the mouse.
"OBJECTIVE: To establish reliability, validity, and minimal detectable change in measures of function in older long-term cancer survivors. METHODS: Older cancer survivors were recruited to perform functional measures; 5 Times Sit-to-Stand (5xSTS), 30-second Timed Chair Rise (30sTCR), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Physical Performance Test-7 (PPT-7). Two testing sessions were completed two weeks apart. Test-retest reliability was examined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(2,1)), convergent and discriminant validity using Spearman’s rho and Minimal Detectable Change (MDC(95)) was calculated. RESULTS: Forty-seven older long-term cancer survivors participated. Test-retest reliability was good for 5xSTS (ICC(2,1)=0.86), 30sTCR (ICC(2,1)=0.89), and SPPB (ICC(2,1)=0.85) and poor for PPT-7 (ICC(2,1)=0.48). Both convergent and discriminant validity was established. CONCLUSIONS: SPPB, 5xSTS, and 30sTCR are reliable and valid tools to measure function in older long-term cancer survivors. MDC(95) values were larger than those reported in geriatrics and should be interpreted with caution. Residual effects of cancer treatment, comorbidity, and physical inactivity may contribute to decreased physical function in older long-term cancer survivors, therefore valid and reliable measures like SPPB and the timed chair rise tests should be used objectively measure function throughout the survivorship spectrum.",Physical function measurement in older long-term cancer survivors
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is immune-driven pathologies that are observed in severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 to 2003 and led to a global outbreak of SARS. As with the outcome of human infection, intranasal infection of C57BL/6J mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV results in high-titer virus replication within the lung, induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell infiltration within the lung. Using this model, we investigated the role of the complement system during SARS-CoV infection. We observed activation of the complement cascade in the lung as early as day 1 following SARS-CoV infection. To test whether this activation contributed to protective or pathologic outcomes, we utilized mice deficient in C3 (C3(–/–)), the central component of the complement system. Relative to C57BL/6J control mice, SARS-CoV-infected C3(–/–) mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung. Significantly fewer neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the lungs of C3(–/–) mice than in C56BL/6J controls, and subsequent studies revealed reduced lung pathology and lower cytokine and chemokine levels in both the lungs and the sera of C3(–/–) mice than in controls. These studies identify the complement system as an important host mediator of SARS-CoV-induced disease and suggest that complement activation regulates a systemic proinflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-mediated disease is largely immune driven and that inhibiting complement signaling after SARS-CoV infection might function as an effective immune therapeutic.",Complement Activation Contributes to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Pathogenesis
"OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate the clinical and immunological characteristics of patients who died of COVID-19 and to identify patients at high risk of death at an early stage and reduce their mortality. RESULTS: Total white blood cell count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients who died of COVID-19 than those who recovered from it (p < 0.05), but the total lymphocyte count, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells and natural killer cells were significantly lower when compared in the same groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased D-dimer, decreased CD4 + T cells and increased neutrophils were risk factors for mortality. Further multiple COX regression demonstrated that neutrophil &#8805; 5.27 × 109/L increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients after adjustment for age and gender. However, CD4 + T cells &#8805; 260/µL appeared to reduce the risk of death. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection led to a significant decrease of lymphocytes, and decreased CD4 + T cell count was a risk factor for COVID-19 patients to develop severe disease and death. METHODS: This study included 190 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from January 30, 2020 to March 4, 2020 in Wuhan, China, of whom 85 died and 105 recovered.

"Over the past ten years, the environmental and veterinary communities have sounded alarms over. an insidious keratinophilous fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, that has decimated populations of bats (yes, bats, Chiropterans) throughout North America, and most recently, Northern China and Siberia. We as dermatologists may find this invasive keratinophilous fungus of particular interest, as its method of destruction is disruption of the homeostatic mechanism of the bat wing integument. Although it is unlikely that this pathogen will become an infectious threat to humans, its environmental impact will likely affect us all, especially as recent data has shown upregulation of naturally occurring coronaviruses in coinfected bats. Dermatologists are familiar with keratinophilous dermatophyte infections, but these rarely cause serious morbidity in individual patients and never cause crisis on a population basis. This manuscript describes the effects of P destructans on both the individual and the population basis.

"To control the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government has been carrying on a series of joint prevention and control measures. Current domestic situation shows an encouraging sign of improvement. However, the situation abroad is in a serious phase. Therefore, interdicting abroad inputs will be the key point at the next stage. In this paper, we establish a dynamical model incorporating with impulse to describe the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of overseas inputs on domestic prevention and control. Considering the imported cases from a typical neighboring country, we study the impacts of control measures under three different levels of control strategy. The simulations for the provinces with risk are given. The numerical experiments show that the current epidemic prevention policy can control the development of the epidemic well in the areas with less imported population;for the provinces with more imported population from the epidemic area, the effective screening and necessary isolation at immigration ports are crucial for preventing the further outbreak caused by imported cases. © 2021, Science China Press.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus with overwhelming demand on healthcare systems, which require advanced predictive analytics to strategize COVID-19 management in a more effective and efficient manner. We analyzed clinical data of 2017 COVID-19 cases reported in the Dubai health authority and developed predictive models to predict the patient's length of hospital stay and risk of death. A decision tree (DT) model to predict COVID-19 length of stay was developed based on patient clinical information. The model showed very good performance with a coefficient of determination R(2) of 49.8% and a median absolute deviation of 2.85 days. Furthermore, another DT-based model was constructed to predict COVID-19 risk of death. The model showed excellent performance with sensitivity and specificity of 96.5 and 87.8%, respectively, and overall prediction accuracy of 96%. Further validation using unsupervised learning methods showed similar separation patterns, and a receiver operator characteristic approach suggested stable and robust DT model performance. The results show that a high risk of death of 78.2% is indicated for intubated COVID-19 patients who have not used anticoagulant medications. Fortunately, intubated patients who are using anticoagulant and dexamethasone medications with an international normalized ratio of <1.69 have zero risk of death from COVID-19. In conclusion, we constructed artificial intelligence–based models to accurately predict the length of hospital stay and risk of death in COVID-19 cases. These smart models will arm physicians on the front line to enhance management strategies to save lives.",Prediction of COVID-19 Hospital Length of Stay and Risk of Death Using Artificial Intelligence-Based Modeling
"Under the background of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in the world, unrestricted and contactless finger vein collection devices have significantly improved public health safety. However, due to the unfixed position of the finger and the open or semi-open characteristics of the acquisition device, it is inevitable to introduce plenty of factors that affect the recognition performance, such as low contrast, uneven illumination and edge disappearance. In view of these practical problems, we propose a method for ROI extraction of finger vein images that combines active contour method and morphological post-processing operations. This method starts from the local segmentation, and finally completes the acquisition of finger masks at the global level, and then combines some morphological operations to achieve precise extraction of finger masks. We designed and conducted plenty of comparison experiments on the proposed algorithm and the current mainstream finger vein image ROI extraction methods on three public available finger vein datasets. Experimental results show that our method accurately extracts the complete finger region mask and achieves the best matching accuracy on all datasets. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"BACKGROUND: To develop a machine learning-based CT radiomics model is critical for the accurate diagnosis of the rapid spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 326 chest CT exams from 134 patients (63 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 71 non-COVID-19 patients) were collected from January 20 to February 8, 2020. A semi-automatic segmentation procedure was used to delineate the volume of interest (VOI), and radiomic features were extracted. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was built on the combination of 4 groups of features, including radiomic features, traditional radiological features, quantifying features, and clinical features. By repeating cross-validation procedure, the performance on the time-independent testing cohort was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: For the SVM model built on the combination of 4 groups of features (integrated model), the per-exam AUC was 0.925 (95% CI 0.856 to 0.994) for differentiating COVID-19 on the testing cohort, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.816 (95% CI 0.651 to 0.917) and 0.923 (95% CI 0.621 to 0.996), respectively. As for the SVM models built on radiomic features, radiological features, quantifying features, and clinical features, individually, the AUC on the testing cohort reached 0.765, 0.818, 0.607, and 0.739, respectively, significantly lower than the integrated model, except for the radiomic model. CONCLUSION: The machine learning-based CT radiomics models may accurately classify COVID-19, helping clinicians and radiologists to identify COVID-19 positive cases.

"Laboratory testing is the single highest-volume medical activity, making it useful to ask how well one can anticipate whether a given test result will be high, low, or within the reference interval (“normal”). We analyzed 10 years of electronic health records—a total of 69.4 million blood tests—to see how well standard rule-mining techniques can anticipate test results based on patient age and gender, recent diagnoses, and recent laboratory test results. We evaluated rules according to their positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC AUCs). Using a stringent cutoff of PPV and/or NPV≥0.95, standard techniques yield few rules for sendout tests but several for in-house tests, mostly for repeat laboratory tests that are part of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Most rules were clinically and pathophysiologically plausible, and several seemed clinically useful for informing pre-test probability of a given result. But overall, rules were unlikely to be able to function as a general substitute for actually ordering a test. Improving laboratory utilization will likely require different input data and/or alternative methods.",Advantages and Limitations of Anticipating Laboratory Test Results from Regression- and Tree-Based Rules Derived from Electronic Health-Record Data
"Deep mutational scanning is a powerful method to explore the mutational fitness landscape of proteins. Its adaptation to anti-CRISPR proteins, which are natural CRISPR-Cas inhibitors and key players in the co-evolution of microbes and phages, would facilitate their in-depth characterization and optimization. Here, we developed a robust anti-CRISPR deep mutational scanning pipeline in Escherichia coli combining synthetic gene circuits based on CRISPR interference with flow cytometry-coupled sequencing and mathematical modeling. Using this pipeline, we created and characterized comprehensive single point mutation libraries for AcrIIA4 and AcrIIA5, two potent inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. The resulting mutational fitness landscapes revealed that both Acrs possess a considerable mutational tolerance as well as an intrinsic redundancy with respect to Cas9 inhibitory features, suggesting evolutionary pressure towards high plasticity and robustness. Finally, to demonstrate that our pipeline can inform the optimization and fine-tuning of Acrs for genome editing applications, we cross-validated a subset of AcrIIA4 mutants via gene editing assays in mammalian cells and in vitro affinity measurements. Together, our work establishes deep mutational scanning as powerful method for anti-CRISPR protein characterization and optimization.",A deep mutational scanning platform to characterize the fitness landscape of anti-CRISPR proteins
"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has severely crippled our globalized society. Despite the chaos, much of our civilization continued to function, thanks to contemporary information and communication technologies. In education, this situation required instructors and students to abandon the traditional face‐to‐face lectures and move to a fully online learning environment. Such a transition is challenging, both for the teacher tasked with creating digital educational content, and the student who needs to study in a new and isolated working environment. As educators, we have experienced these challenges when migrating our university courses to an online environment. Through this paper, we look to assist educators with building and running an online course. Before we needed to transition online, we researched and followed the best practices to establish various digital educational elements in our online classroom. We present these elements, along with guidance regarding their development and use. Next, we designed an empirical study consisting of two surveys, focus group discussions, and observations to understand the factors that influenced students' engagement with our online classroom. We used the same study to evaluate students' perceptions regarding our digital educational elements. We report the findings and define a set of recommendations from these results to help educators motivate their students and develop engaging digital educational content. Although our research is motivated by the pandemic, our findings and contributions are useful to all educators looking to establish some form of online learning.

"BACKGROUND: Prevalence and outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in relation to immunomodulatory medications are still unknown. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents on COVID-19 in a large cohort of patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: The study was conducted in the arthritis outpatient clinic at two large academic hospitals in the COVID-19 most endemic area of Northern Italy (Lombardy). We circulated a cross-sectional survey exploring the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 nasopharyngeal swab positivity and the occurrence of acute respiratory illness (fever and/or cough and/or dyspnea), administered face-to-face or by phone to consecutive patients from 25 February to 20 April 2020. COVID-19 cases were defined as confirmed or highly suspicious according to the World Health Organization criteria. The impact of medications on COVID-19 development was evaluated. RESULTS: The study population included 2050 adults with chronic inflammatory arthritis receiving glucocorticoids, conventional-synthetic (cs), or targeted-synthetic/biological (ts/b) disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs). Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious infection were recorded in 1.1% and 1.4% of the population, respectively. Treatment with glucocorticoids was independently associated with increased risk of COVID-19 (adjusted OR [95% CI] ranging from 1.23 [1.04–1.44] to 3.20 [1.97–5.18] depending on the definition used). Conversely, patients treated with ts/bDMARDs were at reduced risk (adjusted OR ranging from 0.46 [0.18–1.21] to 0.47 [0.46–0.48]). No independent effects of csDMARDs, age, sex, and comorbidities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, treatment with immunomodulatory medications appears safe. Conversely, glucocorticoids, even at low-dose, may confer increased risk of infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered.

"BACKGROUND: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-antibody (MOG-ab)-associated disease (MOGAD) has highly heterogenous clinical and imaging presentations, in which encephalitis is an important phenotype. In recent years, some atypical presentations in MOG-ab-associated encephalitis (MOG-E) have been increasingly reported but have not yet been described well. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and imaging features of patients with MOG-E in our center. Atypical phenotypes would be reported, which is expected to expand the spectrum of MOGAD. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 59 patients with MOGAD diagnosed in our center and identified cases who had ever experienced encephalitic symptoms. Three hundred ten patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) were also reviewed, and cases with positive MOG-ab were identified. Besides, patients with chronically progressive encephalitis were identified from 13 MOG-E and 310 AE patients. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and outcome data to explore clinical and imaging characteristics in MOG-E, especially in the atypical phenotype of chronically progressive encephalitis. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients (7 males, 6 females) with MOG-E. The median age at onset was 33 years (range 13~62 years). Most (9/13, 69.2%) of patients showed acute or subacute onset of encephalitic symptoms. Brain MRI abnormalities were observed in all patients. The most common lesion locations on MRI were cortical/subcortical (11/13, 84.6%), deep/periventricular white matter (10/13, 76.9%) and corpus callosum (4/13, 30.8%). Brain MRI patterns were categorized into four phenotypes. The most common pattern was cortical encephalitis with leptomeningeal enhancement/brain atrophy (10/13, 76.9%). Eight (8/13, 61.5%) patients had a good response to immunotherapy. Four (4/13, 30.8%) patients with chronically progressive course were identified from MOG-E cohort. They showed leukodystrophy-like pattern, multifocal hazy lesions, or cortical encephalitis on MRI. With immunotherapy, they only showed mild or no improvement. We also identified four (4/310, 1.3%) patients with chronically progressive course from AE cohort. They had better outcomes than counterparts in MOG-E. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that encephalitic presentations in MOGAD had complex clinical patterns. Chronically progressive encephalitis may be a new phenotype of MOGAD. We recommend to test MOG-ab in subacute and chronic progressive dementia with leukodystrophy-like MRI lesions.",Clinical and Imaging Features of Patients With Encephalitic Symptoms and Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibodies
"INTRODUCTION Screening programmes represent a considerable amount of healthcare activity. As complex interventions, they require careful delivery to generate net benefit. Much screening work occurs in primary care. Despite intensive study of intervention delivery in primary care, there is currently no synthesis of the delivery of screening programmes in this setting. The purpose of this review is to describe and critically evaluate the delivery of screening programmes in general practice and community services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use scoping review methods to explore which components of screening programmes are delivered in primary care and systematic review methods to locate and synthesise evidence on how screening programmes can be delivered in primary care, including barriers, facilitators and strategies. We will include empirical studies of any design which consider screening programmes in high-income countries, based in part or whole in primary care. We will search 20 information sources from 1 January 2000, including those relating to health (eg, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL), management (eg, Rx for change database) and grey literature (eg, OpenGrey, screening committee websites). Two reviewers will screen citations and full texts of potentially eligible studies and assess these against inclusion criteria. Qualitative and quantitative data will be extracted in duplicate and synthesised using a best fit framework approach. Within the systematic review, the mixed methods appraisal tool will be used to assess risk of bias. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethics approval is required. We will disseminate findings to academics through publication and presentation, to decision-makers through national screening bodies, to practitioners through professional bodies, and to the public through social media.

"Infection is the second leading cause of death in patients with cancer. Loss of efficacy in antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an urgent threat against the continuing success of cancer therapy. In this review, the authors focus on recent updates on the impact of antibiotic resistance in the cancer setting, particularly on the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.). This review highlights the health and financial impact of antibiotic resistance in patients with cancer. Furthermore, the authors recommend measures to control the emergence of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the risk factors associated with cancer care. A lack of data in the etiology of infections, specifically in oncology patients in United States, is identified as a concern, and the authors advocate for a centralized and specialized surveillance system for patients with cancer to predict and prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Finding better ways to predict, prevent, and treat antibiotic-resistant infections will have a major positive impact on the care of those with cancer.",Antibiotic resistance in the patient with cancer: Escalating challenges and paths forward.
"BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may require continuous administration of analgesics, sedatives, and muscle relaxants. Nafamostat has recently been reported as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19. However, there is a lack of information on the compatibility of nafamostat with the aforementioned drug classes. This study evaluated the physical compatibility of nafamostat with these drug classes. METHODS: Nafamostat was combined with 1-3 target drugs (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and rocuronium). Fifteen physical compatibility tests were conducted. Nafamostat was dissolved in 5% glucose solution; the final concentration was 10 mg/mL. All other medications were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain clinically relevant concentrations. The power of hydrogen (pH) of all medications was measured during each test. Compatibility tests were conducted with four test solutions wherein nafamostat and the target drugs were compounded at equal volume ratios (1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1). Visual appearance, turbidity, and pH were evaluated immediately after mixing and at 1 and 3 hours. Physical incompatibilities were defined as gross precipitation, cloudiness, appearance of the Tyndall effect, or a turbidity change of &#8805;0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) based on nafamostat. RESULTS: The mean pH of nafamostat was 3.13 ± 0.03. The combination of nafamostat, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine had the highest pH (3.39 ± 0.01; 3 hours after mixing). All drugs were compatible with nafamostat until 3 hours after admixture, with a mean turbidity value of <0.03 NTU.

"Multidisciplinary treatment of brain tumors has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic In the context of a decrease in the number of neurosurgical interventions by over 50% in most centers from the countries affected by the pandemic, the setting of treatment priorities becomes essential Due to the poor prognosis and biological particularities related to rapid progression, grade IV malignant gliomas are a priority in treatment The severe limitations of hospitalization possibilities in intensive care units and the reduction of the possibilities of administration of adjuvant treatment leads to the necessity to take into account the possibilities for timely administration of adjuvant treatment in the decision for the neurosurgical treatment in new glioblastoma multiforme cases Multidisciplinary team evaluation of each case is mandatory in order to make a rational decision Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase (MGMT) should be assessed as far as possible IDH wild-type status should be a decisive factor in prioritizing the treatment For young patients with a favorable performance status, the standard treatment includes long-course radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide treatment, followed by 6-cycle adjuvant treatment with temozolomide, even in a COVID-19 pandemic scenario The optimal therapeutic choice in the case of elderly and/or frail patients includes a moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen of 40 Gy in 15 daily fractions over 3 weeks, or a hypofractionated protocol with 25 Gy in 5 daily fractions, taking into account the age and Karnoffsky performance status Also, the MGMT methylation status must be taken into account for the decision to omit chemotherapy and for the delivery of a short-course radiotherapy regimen (25 Gy in 5 fractions) Omission of chemotherapy should consider both the additional risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the limited benefit of temozolomide treatment in the case of unmethylated MGMT status © 2021, Czech Medical Association J E Purkyne All rights reserved",The “new normal” for glioblastoma adjuvant treatment in a COVID-19 pandemic scenario
"To determine the spectrum of pathogens causing acute febrile respiratory illness in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adus, we re-analyzed data from a prospective surveillance study involving 50 outpatients (90% of whom received highly active antiretroviral therapy). Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 23 respiratory viruses by multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for atypical bacteria by PCR. Sputum cultures and serological testing were performed. Viruses accounted for 64% of infections. After influenza (22 cases), humanmetapneumovirus infection (6 cases) was most common and was associated with bronchospasm. Bacterial infections occurred in 6 patients (3 of whom had concurrent viral infection). Over 80% of patients received antibiotics. Rapid testing to identify specific viral pathogens could aid in patient management and reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure.",Viral Pathogens Including Human Metapneumovirus Are the Primary Cause of Febrile Respiratory Illness in HIV-Infected Adults Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy
"SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe respiratory disease called COVID-19. Currently, global health is facing its devastating outbreak. However, there is no vaccine available against this virus up to now. In this study, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed to provoke both innate and adaptive immune responses. The immunodominant regions of six non-structural proteins (nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12 and nsp14) of SARS-CoV-2 were selected by multiple immunoinformatic tools to provoke T cell immune response. Also, immunodominant fragment of the functional region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (400–510 residues) protein was selected for inducing neutralizing antibodies production. The selected regions’ sequences were connected to each other by furin-sensitive linker (RVRR). Moreover, the functional region of β-defensin as a well-known agonist for the TLR-4/MD complex was added at the N-terminus of the vaccine using (EAAAK)3 linker. Also, a CD4 + T-helper epitope, PADRE, was used at the C-terminal of the vaccine by GPGPG and A(EAAAK)2A linkers to form the final vaccine construct. The physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity, functionality and population coverage of the final vaccine construct were analyzed. The final vaccine construct was an immunogenic, non-allergen and unfunctional protein which contained multiple CD8 + and CD4 + overlapping epitopes, IFN-γ inducing epitopes, linear and conformational B cell epitopes. It could form stable and significant interactions with TLR-4/MD according to molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Global population coverage of the vaccine for HLA-I and II were estimated 96.2% and 97.1%, respectively. At last, the final vaccine construct was reverse translated to design the DNA vaccine. Although the designed vaccine exhibited high efficacy in silico, further experimental validation is necessary.",Exploring the out of sight antigens of SARS-CoV-2 to design a candidate multi-epitope vaccine by utilizing immunoinformatics approaches
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a catastrophic impact on human health1. Widespread community transmission has triggered stringent distancing measures with severe socio-economic consequences. Gaining control of the pandemic will depend on the interruption of transmission chains until vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity arises. However, approved antiviral treatments such as remdesivir and reconvalescent serum cannot be delivered orally2,3, making them poorly suitable for transmission control. We previously reported the development of an orally efficacious ribonucleoside analogue inhibitor of influenza viruses, MK-4482/EIDD-2801 (refs. 4,5), that was repurposed for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is currently in phase II/III clinical trials (NCT04405570 and NCT04405739). Here, we explored the efficacy of therapeutically administered MK-4482/EIDD-2801 to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection and block transmission in the ferret model, given that ferrets and related members of the weasel genus transmit the virus efficiently with minimal clinical signs6-9, which resembles the spread in the human young-adult population. We demonstrate high SARS-CoV-2 burden in nasal tissues and secretions, which coincided with efficient transmission through direct contact. Therapeutic treatment of infected animals with MK-4482/EIDD-2801 twice a day significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 load in the upper respiratory tract and completely suppressed spread to untreated contact animals. This study identified oral MK-4482/EIDD-2801 as a promising antiviral countermeasure to break SARS-CoV-2 community transmission chains.",Therapeutically Administered Ribonucleoside Analogue MK-4482/EIDD-2801 Blocks SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Ferrets
"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a syndrome usually consisting of paralyzing illness following an infectious process. SARS-COV-2 virus has well documented complications including pneumonia, ARDS, nephropathy, and thrombosis. Neurologic sequelae of GBS, as described in our case are much less common (1). CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old African American male with recent COVID-19 infection, who presented to the emergency department with bilateral lower extremity weakness and bilateral upper extremity tingling for 24 hours. Vital signs were stable on admission. Physical exam revealed quadriparesis and sensory loss, areflexia of L4 and S1 and no saddle anesthesia. MRI brain and cervical spine revealed no signs of myelitis. Due to concern for COVID-19 post viral syndrome in the setting of new, rapidly progressing neurological symptoms, IVIG therapy was initiated. An EMG study was performed and was consistent with length dependent sensory and motor polyneuropathy, with mixed demyelinating and axonal features. Furthermore, there was minimal to absent recruitment of most muscles, consistent with high severity of disease. Patient's condition continued to worsen. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilatory support. While on mechanical ventilation, plasma exchange (PLEX) was initiated with subsequent improvement of his symptoms. Eventually, he was transferred to acute inpatient rehab to continue recovery. DISCUSSION: The most common peripheral nervous system manifestations of COVID-19 usually involve anosmia and chemosensory dysfunction (2). Case reports have shown an association between COVID-19 and GBS. It remains unclear whether humoral molecular mimicry, as seen in C. Jejuni, is also the driving mechanism behind the pathogenesis of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 (3). Reports have highlighted that no known SARS-CoV-2 epitopes have been found to be homologically similar to human peripheral nerve tissue and therefore unable to support immune driven, previously widely described molecular mechanisms of GBS (4). However, this lack of clear genetic similarity does not exclude immune mediated response as it's possible that immunogenic proteins could be modified post-translationally or have non-linear antibody epitopes driving such response (5). In addition, although there has been no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection in CSF (6), a small sample size of CSF studies from COVID 19 patients likely points towards overall inflammation caused by virus leading to immune cascade and possible infiltration of immune cells locally leading to CNS injury (7). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians treating COVID-19 viral syndromes should be aware of the association between COVID-19 and GBS, especially when caring for patients with rapidly progressing neurologic disease. Further work needs to be done to broaden the understanding of pathogenesis of GBS in such cases. REFERENCE #1: Montalvan V, Lee J, Bueso T et al.

"INTRODUCTION: Medical doctors have profound influence on other health professions including physiotherapist as they are at the top of the pyramid of healthcare profession. There is a lack of knowledge of physiotherapy among medical doctors. They may not be knowing of all physiotherapy services and practice. The objective of this study was to find adequate knowledge of physiotherapy practice among medical interns in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on medical interns of a tertiary hospital of Kathmandu between 21(st) March - 20(th) May 2021, after taking ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee. A convenient sampling method was used and sample size was calculated to be 94. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the demographic details and knowledge of Physiotherapy. Data was analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences version 20. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and percentage for binary data. RESULTS: The knowledge of physiotherapy practice was seen adequate among 16 (17%) (95% Confidence Interval = 9.41-24.59) medical interns. Physiotherapy is effective in reducing pain was acknowledged by 89 (97.4 %), 61 (64.9 %) had knowledge about conditions treated by physiotherapy, 55 (58.5 %) had knowledge that physiotherapy treatment follows definite treatment protocol and 26 (27.7 %) had knowledge that exercise prescription is done in physiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of adequate knowledge is less in our study which is similar to other studies done in similar settings. Therefore, there is a need of educating the future medical doctors about physiotherapy, thereby reaching a better patient care.",Knowledge of Physiotherapy Practice among Medical Interns in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study

"BACKGROUND Placement of a primary gastrojejunal tube (GJT) can be technically challenging and often requires an open procedure to negotiate the tube past the duodenal sweep into the jejunum. The alternative approach is to first place a gastrostomy tube (GT), which is then changed to a GJT under endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidance after waiting 6-8 weeks to allow the stoma to mature. We report a case series of primary GJT placement using a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic approach. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement. Patients' demographics and relevant clinical information were analyzed. RESULTS Six patients (4 male, 2 female) were identified. The median age at the time of operation was 30.2 months (range, 28 days-10 years). Five GJTs were successfully placed laparoscopically/endoscopically, and one procedure was converted to open. The mean operative time was 84 minutes (range, 63-102 minutes). Postoperative abdominal radiography confirmed post-pyloric tube position in all patients. Feedings were initiated on the first postoperative day. One intraoperative complication required conversion to an open procedure. No patients developed postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement is technically feasible and an excellent alternative in patients who require transpyloric feeding access.",Combined laparoscopic-endoscopic placement of primary gastrojejunal feeding tubes in children: a preliminary report.
"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are pharmaceuticals whose consumption has increased significantly. They are prescribed as first-line treatment in mental disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, and anxiety; also, they are indicated as adjuvants in diseases such as fibromyalgia and bulimia nervosa. In addition to being linked to the illegal market to be consumed as recreational drugs. The relevance of this review lies in the fact that worldwide consumption has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the depression and anxiety that originated in the population. As a consequence of this increase in consumption, concentrations of SSRIs in the environment have increased, and these have become a relevant issue for toxicologists due to the effects that they could generate in different organisms, both aquatic and terrestrial. For this reason, the objective of this article was to do a critical evaluation of the existing data on the characteristics and physicochemical properties of SSRIs, consumption data during the COVID-19 pandemic, its occurrence in the environment and the reports of toxic effects that have been generated in different organisms; we also conclude with an updated review of different methods that have been used for their removal. With this analysis, it can be concluded that, despite SSRIs are pharmaceutical products widely studied since their launching to the market, still currently under investigation to clarify their mechanisms of action to understand the different effects on the organisms, adverse reactions, as well as possible toxicological effects on non-target organisms. On the other hand, it has been proven that although it is already possible to eliminate a significant percentage of SSRIs in the laboratory, due to their physicochemical characteristics and their behavior in complex mixtures in the environment, they have not yet been eradicated, showing a persistence in the soil, subsoil and surface waters of the entire planet that may represent a future risk.","Consumption and ocurrence of antidepressants (SSRIs) in pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, their environmental impact and innovative removal methods: A review"
"The editors of the special real estate issue introduce the articles contained in the issue and relate them to the concept of resiliency in real estate investments. COVID-19 had a major impact on returns to real estate. However, the resilience of property returns to COVID-19 varied significantly by location, by sector, and even across individual assets of the same property type in the same city. Resilient investments are those able to withstand the effect of not only acute disruptions in the market but also chronic longer-term threats. For real estate, these threats include pandemics, climate change, changing demographics, changes in tenant preferences, changes in technology, and even factors that are unknown and unpredictable at the moment but that may become important in the future. As some of these threats may not be insurable and may not be diversifiable, much of the work of risk management in creating resilient real estate portfolios will need to be at the property level. A number of approaches can be implemented to increase resilience at a property, but flexibility in building design may be among the most important.",Resilient Real Estate

"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a 5-week national lockdown on ambulance service demand during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING: High-quality data from ambulance electronic clinical records, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulance records were obtained from 588 690 attendances during pre-lockdown (prior to 17 February 2020) and from 36 238 records during the lockdown period (23 March to 26 April 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulance service utilisation during lockdown was compared with pre-lockdown: (a) descriptive analyses of ambulance events and proportions of event types for each period, (b) absolute rates of ambulance attendance (event types/week) for each period. RESULTS: During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p<0.001). Road traffic crashes (p<0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p<0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95% CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p<0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p<0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a population's mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.",Changes in demand for emergency ambulances during a nationwide lockdown that resulted in elimination of COVID-19: an observational study from New Zealand
"This article analyzes ways that logistical services add value to products over and above traditional utility tradeoffs as a result of a confluence of aesthetic, economic, and cultural facets that we identify as enchantment. We delve into how enchantment might be digitally articulated through mediated (as opposed to brick and mortar) consumption, paying attention to the cultural techniques and affordances of the platforms and spaces. Through a series of case studies, we examine ways in which enchantment can occur in digitally mediated shopping environments. Our case studies suggest that enchanted digital logistical channels extend the value-creating functions of traditional logistics by creating consumption circumstances that surprise and intrigue, that suggest perceived scarcity, and that use social media to approach consumers in multiple ways to procure enchantment.",Digital logistics: Enchantment in distribution channels
"In the hospital, a limited number of COVID-19 test kits are available due to the spike in cases every day. For this reason, a rapid alternative diagnostic option should be introduced as an automated detection method to prevent COVID-19 spreading among individuals. This article proposes multi-objective optimization and a deep-learning methodology for the detection of infected coronavirus patients with X-rays. J48 decision tree method classifies the deep characteristics of affected X-ray corona images to detect the contaminated patients effectively. Eleven different convolutional neuronal network-based (CNN) models were developed in this study to detect infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet500, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet). In addition, the parameters of the CNN profound learning model are described using an emperor penguin optimizer with several objectives (MOEPO). A broad review reveals that the proposed model can categorise the X-ray images at the correct rates of precision, accuracy, recall, specificity and F1-score. Extensive test results show that the proposed model outperforms competitive models with well-known efficiency metrics. The proposed model is, therefore, useful for the real-time classification of X-ray chest images of COVID-19 disease.",DON: Deep Learning and Optimization-Based Framework for Detection of Novel Coronavirus Disease Using X-ray Images
"Background: The implications of the menstrual cycle for disease susceptibility, development, and severity of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are largely unknown. Case presentation: We report a 37-year-old woman infected with SARS-CoV-2 who showed a 16-day incubation period. She developed a fever on the first day of her menstrual period, and again on the first day of her next menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were positive during the first menstrual period before admission, turned negative during hospitalization, and then positive again during the second menstrual period after hospital discharge. Conclusions: : This case indicates sex hormones may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For women with history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the management protocol should include assessment of the menstrual status.",Changes in RT-PCR test results and symptoms during the menstrual cycle of a female individual infected with SARS-CoV-2: a case report
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to systematically review current studies reporting on clinical outcomes in people living with HIV (PLHIV) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Global Health, SCOPUS, Medline and EMBASE using pertinent key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms relating to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and HIV. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. Articles are summarized in relevant sections. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty‐five articles were identified after duplicates had been removed. After screening, eight studies were analysed, totalling 70 HIV‐infected patients (57 without AIDS and 13 with AIDS). Three themes were identified: (1) controlled HIV infection does not appear to result in poorer COVID‐19 outcomes, (2) more data are needed to determine COVID‐19 outcomes in patients with AIDS and (3) HIV‐infected patients presenting with COVID‐19 symptoms should be investigated for superinfections. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PLHIV with well‐controlled disease are not at risk of poorer COVID‐19 disease outcomes than the general population. It is not clear whether those with poorly controlled HIV disease and AIDS have poorer outcomes. Superimposed bacterial pneumonia may be a risk factor for more severe COVID‐19 but further research is urgently needed to elucidate whether PLHIV are more at risk than the general population.",Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outcomes in HIV/AIDS patients: a systematic review
"BACKGROUND Electroencephalographic-based monitoring systems such as the bispectral index (BIS) may reduce anaesthetic overdose rates. OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that goal-directed sevoflurane administration (guided by BIS monitoring) could reduce the sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) and intraoperative vasopressor doses during on-pump cardiac surgery. DESIGN A prospective, controlled, sequential two-arm clinical study. SETTING German university medical centre with more than 2500 cardiac surgery interventions per year. PATIENTS Sixty elective on-pump cardiac surgery patients. INTERVENTION In group Sevo1.8% (n = 29), the sedation depth was maintained with a sustained inspired concentration of sevoflurane 1.8% before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In group SevoBIS (n = 31), the inspired sevoflurane concentration was titrated to maintain a BIS target between 40 and 60. OUTCOME MEASURES SPC during CPB and the intraoperative administration of noradrenaline. Additional analyses were performed on intraoperative awareness, postoperative blood lactate concentration, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay and kidney injury. RESULTS Mean inspired sevoflurane concentration was 0.8% in group SevoBIS, representing a 57.1% reduction (P < 0.001) compared with group Sevo1.8%. The mean SPC was 42.3 μg ml(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.0 to 44.6] in group Sevo1.8% and 21.0 μg ml(-1) (95% CI 18.8 to 23.3) in group SevoBIS, representing a 50.2% reduction (P < 0.001). During CPB, the mean cumulative dose of noradrenaline administered was 13.48 μg kg(-1) (95% CI 10.52 to 17.19) in group Sevo1.8% and 4.06 μg kg(-1) (95% CI 2.67 to 5.97) in group SevoBIS (P < 0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient (between the cumulative applied dosage of sevoflurane calculated from the area under the curve of the SPC over time and the administered cumulative noradrenaline dose) was 0.607 (P < 0.001). No intraoperative awareness signs were detected. CONCLUSION BIS-guided titration of sevoflurane reduces the SPC and decreases noradrenaline administration compared with routine care during on-pump cardiac surgery.","Bispectral index guided titration of sevoflurane in on-pump cardiac surgery reduces plasma sevoflurane concentration and vasopressor requirements: a prospective, controlled, sequential two-arm clinical study."
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented restrictions to travel and in-person activities that limit hematology/oncology (HO) fellowship programs' (FP) recruitment activities. Prospective applicants rely on websites and social media (SOME) to guide their decisions of applying or ranking a FP. We aim to evaluate HO FP's digital footprint in order to identify informational gaps. Methods: The AMA Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) was queried for all HO programs. We searched Google, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube for HO FP pages. Content was evaluated using published criteria. Qualitative content analysis of SOME posts is planned. Results: Our analysis includes 176 FP that actively recruited during the 2020 match season. Over half (57%, n = 100) were universitybased and the median number of fellow positions per year was 4 per FP (range 0-16). Most FP had websites (95%, n = 167) with varying information (Table) for prospective applicants. Twenty percent (n = 33) included a diversity statement. While 63% (n = 106) of FP provided application information, only 51% discussed visa requirements. Few FP websites included key information such as why fellows chose a particular FP (7%, n = 12), accolades of fellows (3%, n = 5), or employment location of alumni (25%, n = 44). Only 42% (n = 69) provided city, and 5% (n = 8) showed fellows socializing. Thirty-four FP (19%) have informational videos (range 1-10) in YouTube (length range: 1:37-18:15min). Most (82%;n = 28) were published since May 2020 in alignment with the FP recruitment season. Twitter was the second most common SOME platform, used by 19% (n = 32) of FP. 56% (n = 18) joined Twitter since May 2020 correlating with the current recruitment season. The number of Twitter followers (median 119, range: 0-1408) and posts (median 47, range: 0- 687) varied across FP. Only 4% used Facebook and 6% Instagram. Conclusions: Our analysis of FP's digital footprint revealed that applicants participating in the 1st virtual HO recruitment season were provided limited online information. Programs can use online content to provide information on resources, research opportunities, and achievements of faculty and fellows that can guide applicant decision making. In the era of COVID-19, highlighting the diversity and breath of each FP, hospital, and city are vital to attract a diverse and talented pool of trainees.",Digital footprint of hematologyoncology fellowship programs: Identifying gaps after the first virtual recruitment season
"OBJECTIVES: Whole-slide imaging and virtual microscopy (VM) have revolutionised teaching, diagnosis and research in histopathology. This study aimed to establish the feasibility of achieving early integration of clinical reasoning with undergraduate pathology teaching on a VM platform and to determine its student-centricity through student feedback. METHODS: This study was conducted at the Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, between August and December 2017. A total of 38 VM-centred clinical cases were introduced to 49 students in an integrated undergraduate medical curriculum. The cases were aligned to curricular objectives, reinforced the pathologic basis of disease with critical thinking and were delivered across 15 interactive small-group sessions. A simulated cross-disciplinary integration and judicious choice of pertinent diagnostic investigations were linked to principles of management. Feedback was obtained through a mixed-methods approach. RESULTS: User-friendliness, gradual learning curve of VM and annotation-capacity were scored as 4–5 (on a Likert scale of 1–5) by 91.84%, 87.76% and 83.67% of the participants, respectively. Most students agreed that the content matched the stage of learning (81.63%), theme of the week (91.84%) and development of a strong clinical foundation (77.55%). Integration (85.71%) and clinico-pathological correlation (83.67%) were the strengths of this educational effort. High student attendance (~100%) and improved assessment scores on critical thinking (80%) were observed. Software lacunae included frequent logouts and lack of note-taking tools. Easy access was a significant student-centric advantage. CONCLUSION: A VM-centred approach with a clinico-pathological correlation has been successfully introduced to inculcate integrated learning. Using the pathologic basis of disease as a fulcrum and critical reasoning as an anchor, a digitally-enabled generation of medical students have embraced this educational tool for tutor-guided, student-centred learning.",Virtual Microscopy in Undergraduate Pathology Education: An early transformative experience in clinical reasoning
"Climate warming has changed vegetation phenology, and the phenology-associated impacts on terrestrial water fluxes remain largely unquantified. The impacts are linked to plant adjustments and responses to climate change and can be different in different hydroclimatic regions. Based on remote sensing data and observed river runoff of hydrological station from six river basins across a hydroclimatic gradient from northeast to southwest in China, the relative contributions of the vegetation (including spring and autumn phenology, growing season length (GSL), and gross primary productivity) and climatic factors affecting the river runoffs over 1982-2015 were investigated by applying gray relational analysis (GRA). We found that the average GSLs in humid regions (190-241 days) were longer than that in semi-humid regions (186-192 days), and the average GSLs were consistently extended by 4.8-13.9 days in 1982-2015 period in six river basins. The extensions were mainly linked to the delayed autumn phenology in the humid regions and to advanced spring phenology in the semi-humid regions. Across all river basins, the GRA results showed that precipitation (r = 0.74) and soil moisture (r = 0.73) determine the river runoffs, and the vegetation factors (VFs) especially the vegetation phenology also affected the river runoffs (spring phenology: r = 0.66; GSL: r = 0.61; autumn phenology: r = 0.59), even larger than the contribution from temperature (r = 0.57), but its relative importance is climatic region-dependent. Interestingly, the spring phenology is the main VF in the humid region for runoffs reduction, while both spring and autumn growth phenology are the main VFs in the semi-humid region, because large autumn phenology delay and less water supply capacity in spring amplify the effect of advanced spring phenology. This article reveals diverse linkages between climatic and VFs, and runoff in different hydroclimatic regions, and provides insights that vegetation phenology influences the ecohydrology process largely depending on the local hydroclimatic conditions, which improve our understanding of terrestrial hydrological responses to climate change.",Influences of Shifted Vegetation Phenology on Runoff Across a Hydroclimatic Gradient

As it is a home-based modality, PD should be considered as a preferred mode of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for patients with kidney failure during this COVID-19 pandemic as it avoids frequent visits to hospitals and/or satellite dialysis centres. The highly infectious nature of this virus has led to the implementation of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition orange status in Singapore since early February 2020. This paper summarises the strategies for management of several aspects of PD in Singapore during this COVID-19 pandemic, including PD catheter insertion, PD training, home visit and assisted PD, outpatient PD clinic, inpatient management of PD patients with or without COVID-19 infection, PD as KRT for COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury, management of common complications in PD (peritonitis and fluid overload), and management of PD inventory.",Strategies for Management of Peritoneal Dialysis Patients in Singapore during COVID-19 Pandemic.
"Introduction: Burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as result of the chronic stress at the work place which wars not successfully managed. The possible negative effects on the medical staff the patients and the health institutions have generated interest and motivated the research to understand the possible causes, these ejects also influence the burnout predictors. The medical services suppliers within the emergency department have had one of the greatest exhaution occurences even before the pandemic. Being in the first line in contact with the suspected patients or confirmed with COVID-19 infection intensifies this fact. Both the working . factors (working hours, years of practice, number of treated patients, professional development activities) and the socio- demographic factors (age, sex. civil status, income. education) are associated with the exhaustion at the work place. Material and methods: I have studied a total of 120 participants, receiving 115 valid questionnaires, the answering ratio being 95,83%.This was a descriptive, multicentre, transversal study of the medical and the auxiliary staff within the department UPU-SMURD of the County Clinic Emergency Hospital ""Sf. Ap. Andrei"" Galati. The staff gave their consent and attended a combined interview which consisted of a pilot questionnaire and a demographic questionnaire. Results and discussions: The average score of exhaustion at the staff =level was 3.25, a great percentage of the doctors- within the ED (45.8%), (n=24) indicates an increased level of exhaustion, only 26.8% (n=80) of nurses show an increased level of exhaustion. The average score o f the stress level shown bt the staff is 3.1, 66.6% (n=24) among which the doctors with an increased stress level 9.1% (n=9) auxiliary staff, 23.8% (n=80) of nurses. Conclusions: The results show us a high exhaustion, stress and depression ratio at the emergency doctors in comparison with the other professional categories within the ED. A high level of professional satisfaction is accompanied by an increased level of stress and of self-esteem.",Emotional Exhaustion and Professional Satisfaction During Covid-19 Pandemic at the Level of Emergency Department Staff
"The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent rollout of public health lockdown orders, social distancing measures, and general avoidance of crowded and enclosed places, like mass public transport, have disrupted everyday transport mobilities worldwide. This paper offers insights on the transformative potential of pandemic disruption on transport behaviours through the experiences of commuter cycling reactivation which took place in Sydney, Australia since March 2020. We combine sensory ethnography with Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the refrain to interpret the pandemic as an experimental reference point in the reactivation of commuter cycling, specifically with regards to timing, flow, and spacings. Experiences of commuter cycling in Sydney reveal how fear is attached to cycling bodies. The sensations of self that arise through such conflict are differentiated within and between gendered bodies and urban topography, elements, and infrastructure. We find that for reactivated cyclists, the ability to fashion commuter cycling territories as safe and efficient is an ongoing experimental process of temporal and spatial segregation and separation. In this regard, the pandemic rendered concrete new possibilities of everyday commuting, but these remained constrained by popular discourses relating to cycling and cyclists.","Reactivating commuter cycling: COVID-19 pandemic disruption to everyday transport choices in Sydney, Australia"
"PURPOSE: This prospective cohort study aimed to assess early root migration after a coronectomy of the mandibular third molar at 2 and 6 months after surgery. METHODS: We included all patients treated with a coronectomy of an impacted mandibular third molar. The primary outcome measure was the extent of postoperative root migration after 2 and 6 months. Migration was measured as the distance between the root complex and a fixed point on the inferior alveolar canal. The secondary aim was to identify factors (age, impaction pattern, and patient sex) that affected the extent of root migration. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five coronectomies were performed in 141 patients (96 females and 45 males; mean age 33.1 years, SD 16.0). The 2-month checkup was completed by 121 patients that received 141 coronectomies. The 6-month check-up was completed by 73 patients that received 80 coronectomies. The mean root migrations were 3.30 mm (SD 2.53 mm) at 2 months and 5.27 mm (SD 3.14 mm) at 6 months. In the 2–6-month interval, the mean root migration was 2.58 mm (SD 2.07 mm). The extents of migration were similar during the 0–2-month interval and the 2–6-month interval (p = 0.529). Younger age was associated with greater root migration, and females experienced significantly greater migrations than males (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Roots migrated more rapidly in the first two postoperative months, compared to the 2–6-month interval. Age was negatively correlated with the extent of root migration, and females showed significantly greater migrations than males.",Early root migration after a mandibular third molar coronectomy
"Objective: To evaluate the adherence to antihypertensive treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated variables. Design and method: Cross-sectional study was performed with outpatient, from a Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were: age &gt;18 years old, telephone number, in treatment for at least six months. Pregnant women were excluded. The period defined to characterize the assessment of social distance due to the COVID-19 pandemic was from March, 24 until August, 31. Hypertensive patients were interviewed by telephone. The adherence to treatment was assessed by Morisky and Green scale and the BP control was systolic BP &lt;140 mmHg and diastolic BP &lt;90 mmHg. Biosocial data, habits and lifestyles and attitudes towards social distancing measures were evaluated. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee. The significance level was p&lt;=0.05. Results: The sample was 281 hypertensive patients: 62.3% women;66 (14) years old;348,7 (255,8) $USA monthly income;43.8% completed high school;60.5% white;47.0% married;and 59.1% retired. It was found that 58.7% were adherent to antihypertensive treatment and BP control was 51.6%. The systolic BP was 138.5 (22.7) mmHg and diastolic BP was 77.3 (14.4) mmHg. As for drug treatment, 55.2% of hypertensive patients received the drugs sent by the hospital pharmacy via mail, 63.9% reported that during the COVID-19 pandemic there was a problem in receiving the drugs and 10% was without antihypertensive sometime at home. The variables associated with treatment adherence were: race black (OR 0.40;95% CI: 0.21-0.73), education elementary school II (OR 2.97;95% CI: 1.24-7.06), stayed without antihypertensive at home someday from quarantine (OR 0.40;95% CI: 0.17-0.95) and diastolic BP (OR 0.98;CI: 0.96-0.99). During the period of the pandemic evaluated, it was also observed that 77.6% reported leaving home, 13.5% had contact with people with the disease and 91.8% reported not feeling safe to leave the house after the end of quarantine. Conclusions: The rate of non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic was high and was associated with unfavorable biosocial variables.",Adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment on the COVID-19 pandemic
"Previously, our group engineered a plant-derived monoclonal antibody (MAb) (pHu-E16) that efficiently treated West Nile virus (WNV) infection in mice. In this study, we developed several pHu-E16 variants to improve its efficacy. These variants included a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of pHu-E16 fused to the heavy chain (HC) constant domains (C(H) (1-3)) of human IgG (pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3)) and a tetravalent molecule (Tetra pHu-E16) assembled from pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) with a second pHu-E16scFv fused to the light chain (LC) constant region. pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) and Tetra pHu-E16 were efficiently expressed and assembled in plants. To assess the impact of differences in N-linked glycosylation on pHu-E16 variant assembly and function, we expressed additional pHu-E16 variants with various combinations of HC and LC components. Our study revealed that proper pairing of HC and LC was essential for the complete N-glycan processing of antibodies in both plant and animal cells. Associated with their distinct N-glycoforms, pHu-E16, pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) and Tetra pHu-E16 exhibited differential binding to C1q and specific Fcγ receptors (FcγR). Notably, none of the plant-derived Hu-E16 variants showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity in CD32A(+) human cells, suggesting the potential of plant-produced antibodies to minimize the adverse effect of ADE. Importantly, all plant-derived MAb variants exhibited at least equivalent in vitro neutralization and in vivo protection in mice compared to mammalian cell-produced Hu-E16. This study demonstrates the capacity of plants to express and assemble a large, complex and functional IgG-like tetravalent mAb variant and also provides insight into the relationship between MAb N-glycosylation, FcγR and C1q binding, and ADE. These new insights may allow the development of safer and cost effective MAb-based therapeutics for flaviviruses, and possibly other pathogens.",Generation and Analysis of Novel Plant-Derived Antibody-Based Therapeutic Molecules against West Nile Virus
"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 and consequent pandemic has presented unique challenges. Beyond the direct COVID-related mortality in those with liver disease, we sought to determine the effect of lockdown on people with liver disease in Scotland. The effect of lockdown on those with alcohol-related disease is of interest; and whether there were associated implications for a change in alcohol intake and consequent presentations with decompensated disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to seven Scottish hospitals with a history of liver disease between 1 April and 30 April 2020 and compared across the same time in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We also repeated an intermediate assessment based on a single centre to examine for delayed effects between 1 April and 31 July 2020. RESULTS: We found that results and outcomes for patients admitted in 2020 were similar to those in previous years in terms of morbidity, mortality, and length of stay. In the Scotland-wide cohort: admission MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease) (16 (12–22) vs 15 (12–19); p=0.141), inpatient mortality ((10.9% vs 8.6%); p=0.499) and length of stay (8 days (4–15) vs 7 days (4–13); p=0.140). In the Edinburgh cohort: admission MELD (17 (12–23) vs 17 (13–21); p=0.805), inpatient mortality ((13.7% vs 10.1%; p=0.373) and length of stay (7 days (4–14) vs 7 days (3.5–14); p=0.525)). CONCLUSION: This assessment of immediate and medium-term lockdown impacts on those with chronic liver disease suggested a minimal effect on the presentation of decompensated liver disease to secondary care.",Effect of COVID-19 on presentations of decompensated liver disease in Scotland
"Background: There is a need for validated clinical risk scores to identify patients at risk of severe disease and to guide decision-making during the covid-19 pandemic. The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is widely used in emergency medicine, but so far, no studies have evaluated its use in patients with covid-19. We aimed to study the performance of NEWS2 and compare commonly used clinical risk stratification tools at admission to predict risk of severe disease and in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study in a public non-university general hospital in the Oslo area, Norway, including a cohort of all 66 patients hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the start of the pandemic;13 who died during hospital stay and 53 who were discharged alive. Data were collected consecutively from March 9 th to April 27 th 2020. The main outcome was the ability of the NEWS2 score and other clinical risk scores at emergency department admission to predict severe disease and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for NEWS2 scores ≥5 and ≥6, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score ≥2, ≥2 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and CRB-65 score ≥2. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for the clinical risk scores were compared using DeLong’s test. Results: In total, 66 patients (mean age 67.9 years) were included. Of these, 23% developed severe disease. In-hospital mortality was 20%. Tachypnoea, hypoxemia and confusion at admission were more common in patients developing severe disease. A NEWS2 score ≥6 at admission predicted severe disease with 80.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690-0.953). NEWS2 was superior to qSOFA score ≥2 (AUC 0.624, 95% CI 0.446-0.810, p<0.05) and other clinical risk scores for this purpose. Conclusion: NEWS2 score at hospital admission predicted severe disease and in-hospital mortality, and was superior to other widely used clinical risk scores in patients with covid-19.",National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission predicts severe disease and in-hospital mortality from Covid-19 - A prospective cohort study
"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care center in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to identify early risk factors for in-hospital mortality in these patients. METHODS: A total of 371 adult patients (>18 years) admitted to the ICU of Al Ain Hospital between March 16 and July 19, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs were included. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53 years (standard deviation = 13). Patients were mostly male (n = 314 [84.6%]) and of South Asian origin (n = 231 [62.3%]). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 182 (49.1%) patients for a median of 11 days (25–75% interquartile range: 6–17). During the ICU stay, renal replacement therapy was required in 87 (23.5%) and vasopressor therapy in 190 (51.2%) patients. ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 9 (IQ: 5–17) and 18 (IQ: 13–29) days, respectively and ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 20.2%. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable, greater Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on ICU admission, diarrhea prior to hospital admission, greater, admission from hospital ward, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio on admission to the ICU were independently associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in the UAE, COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Identifying patients at high risk of death may help detect future therapeutic targets.",Characteristics and outcome of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia admitted to a tertiary care center in the United Arab Emirates during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

"Research efforts in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic focused on the actual and potential impacts on societies, economies, sectors, and governments. Less attention was paid to the experiences of individuals and less still to the impact of COVID-19 on an individual’s wellbeing. This research addresses this gap by utilising a holistic wellbeing framework to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the overall wellbeing of individuals in the Australian state of South Australia through an online survey. The research framework for the survey comprises six dimensions: psychological and emotional health, physical health, living standards, family and community vitality, governance, and ecological diversity and resilience. The results show that most respondents (71%) were able to maintain overall wellbeing during the pandemic. However, more than a half of the respondents could not maintain wellbeing in psychological and emotional health. Further examination of the drivers of inability to maintain overall wellbeing reveals that low-income individuals, younger respondents (aged 18–24) and women suffer disproportionate hardships. Defining poverty in terms of multi-dimensional deprivations in wellbeing enables a nuanced analysis of the unequal impacts of COVID-19 mitigation policies that can be used to improve policymaking.","COVID-19, individual wellbeing and multi-dimensional poverty in the state of South Australia"
"BACKGROUND The corona virus pandemic rapidly sweeps across the world; it is inducing a considerable degree of depression, stress and anxiety concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as migrant workers. The aim of the study is to find out mental health status of migrant workers rescued by Nepal Government from different countries during corona virus disease -19-19 pandemic. METHODS Cross-sectional descriptive study involving 427 returned migrant workers was conducted using the depression, anxiety and stress scale -21(DASS-21). Association between socio-demographic variables to mental health status was performed using chi-square test and p-value <0.05 was considered as significant level. RESULTS Out of 427 participants, 4 % of respondents found to have extremely severe level of stress followed by 1.9 % extremely severe level of depression and 2.3% extremely severe level of anxiety. The association between mental health status and covariates showed that depression, anxiety and stress were associated with the place of residence, educational status of the respondents, and their perception of corona virus disease -19 risk at workplace, and test for COVID-19 after arrival to Nepal. CONCLUSIONS The study revealed that job loss, visa and employment contract expiry were the main reasons for migrant workers to return Nepal. Nearly one fourth of the respondents had suffered from depression, nearly one third from stress and 17% from anxiety. Necessary psychosocial interventions should be formulated and implemented for addressing the mental health problems of migrant workers during the corona virus disease -19-19 pandemic.",Mental Health Status of Migrant Nepalese Workers Rescued By Government of Nepal During the Corona Virus disease -19 Pandemic.
"OBJECTIVE: Molecular tests predicting the risk of distant recurrence (DR) can be used to assist therapy decision-making in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer patients after considerations of standard clinical markers. The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is a widespread tool used for this purpose. Here, we compared the RS with the StemPrintER Risk Score (SPRS), a novel genomic predictor with a unique biological basis in its ability to measure the expression of cancer stemness genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We benchmarked the SPRS vs. RS, alone or in combination with clinicopathological variables expressed by the Clinical Treatment Score (CTS), for the prognostication of DR in a retrospective cohort of 776 postmenopausal patients with ER+/HER2-breast cancer enrolled in the translational arm of the randomised Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial. Likelihood ratio (LR) with χ2 test and C-index were used to assess prognostic performance for the entire ten-year follow-up period and in early (0-5 years) and late (5-10 years) intervals. RESULTS: In all patients, the SPRS provided significantly more prognostic information than the RS for ten-year DR prognostication (C-index = 0.688, LR-χ2 = 33.4 vs. C-index = 0.641, LR-χ2 = 22.1) and for late (5-10 years) DR prognostication (C-index = 0.689, LR-χ2 = 18.8 vs. C-index = 0.571, LR-χ2 = 4.7). The SPRS also provided more prognostic information than the RS when added to the CTS in all patients (CTS + SPRS: LR-Δχ2 = 14.9; CTS + RS: LR-Δχ2 = 9.7) and in node-negative patients (CTS + SPRS: LR-Δχ2 = 11.7; CTS + RS: LR-Δχ2 = 6.6). CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients, SPRS provided more prognostic information than RS for DR when used alone or in combination with the CTS. The SPRS could therefore potentially identify high-risk patients, who might benefit from aggressive treatments, from low-risk patients who might safely avoid adjuvant chemotherapy or prolongation of endocrine therapy.",Comparison of StemPrintER with Oncotype DX Recurrence Score for predicting risk of breast cancer distant recurrence after endocrine therapy
"Despite uncertainty about its clinical benefit, ivermectin has been ufor COVID 19, even in prophylaxis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has advised against its use for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 outside randomised clinical trials. Although the potential negative environmental effects of ivermectin have been widely recognised when used in veterinary medicine, scarce attention has been devoted to the potential ecotoxicological impact of human use.

"Although the rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in relation to clinical settings, is causing concern in many regions of the globe, remote, extreme environments, such as Antarctica, are thought to be relatively free from the negative impact of human activities. In fact, Antarctica is often perceived as the last pristine continent on Earth. Such remote regions, which are assumed to have very low levels of AMR due to limited human activity, represent potential model environments to understand the mechanisms and interactions underpinning the early stages of evolution, de novo development, acquisition and transmission of AMR. Antarctica, with its defined zones of human colonisation (centred around scientific research stations) and large populations of migratory birds and animals, also has great potential with regard to mapping and understanding the spread of early-stage zoonotic interactions. However, to date, studies of AMR in Antarctica are limited. Here, we survey the current literature focussing on the following: i).. Dissection of human-introduced AMR versus naturally occurring AMR, based on the premise that multiple drug resistance and resistance to synthetic antibiotics not yet found in nature are the results of human contamination; ii).. The potential role of endemic wildlife in AMR spread. There is clear evidence for greater concentrations of AMR around research stations, and although data show reverse zoonosis of the characteristic human gut bacteria to endemic wildlife, AMR within birds and seals appears to be very low, albeit on limited samplings. Furthermore, areas where there is little, to no, human activity still appear to be free from anthropogenically introduced AMR. However, a comprehensive assessment of AMR levels in Antarctica is virtually impossible on current data due to the wide variation in reporting standards and methodologies used and poor geographical coverage. Thus, future studies should engage directly with policymakers to promote the implementation of continent-wide AMR reporting standards. The development of such standards alongside a centralised reporting system would provide baseline data to feedback directly into wastewater treatment policies for the Antarctic Treaty Area to help preserve this relatively pristine environment.

"INTRODUCTION: Quality-assured antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) depends upon the knowledge and skills of laboratory staff. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Pakistan, such types of knowledge and skills are limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use openaccess online courses to improve the knowledge of laboratory staff involved in the detection and reporting of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). METHODOLOGY: Seven online modules comprising 22 courses aimed at strengthening the laboratory detection of Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were developed. The courses were uploaded onto the website www.parn.org.pk. Participants had an option of selecting courses of their interest. Online registration and completion of a pre-course assessment (pre-test) were essential for enrolment. However, participation in post-course assessment (post-test) was optional. The number of registered participants and the proportion of participants who completed each course were computed. A paired t-test was used to assess the increase between mean pre- and post-test scores. The association between the participants working in public vs. private laboratories and course completion rates were determined using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 227 participants from Pakistan (March 2018 to June 2020) were registered. The largest number of registered participants and the highest completion rate were noted for AST and biosafety courses, while quality-related courses attracted a lower interest. A comparison of pre- and post-test performance using the paired mean score for the individual courses showed a statistically significant (the value of p < 0.05) improvement in 13/20 assessed courses. A higher course completion rate was observed in participants from public vs. private sector laboratories (56.8 vs. 30.8%, the value of p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a promising potential for open online courses (OOCs) toward addressing knowledge gaps in laboratory practice in resource limited settings.",Open Online Courses for Strengthening Laboratory-Based Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance in Pakistan
"This paper presents a data-based simple model for fitting the available data of the Covid-19 pandemic evolution in France. The time series concerning the 13 regions of mainland France have been considered for fitting and validating the model. An extremely simple, two-dimensional model with only two parameters demonstrated to be able to reproduce the time series concerning the number of daily demises caused by Covid-19, the hospitalizations, intensive care and emergency accesses, the daily number of positive test and other indicators, for the different French regions. These results might contribute to stimulate a debate on the suitability of much more complex models for reproducing and forecasting the pandemic evolution since, although relevant from a mechanistic point of view, they could lead to nonidentifiability issues.",The Ockham's razor applied to COVID-19 model fitting French data
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze thin-section computed tomography (CT) appearances of interstitial lung diseases before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum, and to evaluate the relationship between pneumomediastinum and parenchymal changes on thin-section CT. MATERIALS & METHODS: We reviewed CT images before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum in 13 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (8 patients) and collagen vascular diseases (5 patient). The extent of the total area of reticular opacity, increased opacity (ground-glass opacity and consolidation), and honeycombing were scored, and these scores were compared before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum. We also divided patients into two groups according to therapy received. Patients in group 1 experienced pneumomediastinum after or during treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents for acute or subacute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease. Patients in group 2 experienced pneumomediastinum without therapy. RESULTS: The mean score of all patients for honeycombing significantly increased at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum ([Formula: see text]). In group 1, the extent of increasing opacity had been decreased significantly at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum ([Formula: see text]). In group 2, the mean CT score of reticular opacity, increasing opacity, and honeycombing significantly increased at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum ([Formula: see text] , 0.018, and 0.018, respectively).

"BACKGROUND: The main adverse effect is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with concern on the development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in the long term. However, the relationship between SG and GERD is complex. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate all published data existing in the literature to evaluate the effect of sleeve gastrectomy on GERD, esophagitis, BE in order to clarify the long-term clinical sequelae of this procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review. The work has been reported in line with the PRISMA criteria [19]. We evaluated the quality and risk of bias of this Systematic Review using AMSTAR 2 checklist [20]. Published studies that contained outcome data for primary sleeve gastrectomy associated with the primary and secondary outcomes listed below were included. The UIN for ClinicalTrial.gov Protocol Registration and Results System is: NCT05178446 for the Organization UFoggia. RESULTS: 49 articles were eligible for inclusion that met the following criteria: publications dealing with patients undergoing laparoscopic SG, publications describing pre- and postoperative GERD symptoms and/or esophageal function tests, articles in English, human studies and text complete available. CONCLUSIONS: We have controversial data on LSG and GERD in the literature as there is a multifactorial relationship between LSG and GERD. The most recent studies have shown satisfactory control of postoperative reflux in most patients and low rates of de novo GERD. These data are leading to wider acceptance of LSG as a bariatric procedure even in obese patients with GERD.",The new onset of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy: A systematic review
"In this brief communication we are showing original research results with early estimates from Danish nationwide databases of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) up to five months after a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 -19 vaccines. Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%).",Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Omicron or Delta variants following a two-dose or booster BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccination series: A Danish cohort study
"Aim: Bibliometrics has been used for assessing and predicting trends in macro-health science and medical systems, especially in the field of cancer. Bibliometric and scientometric studies in the field of cytokines may guide further research in this field. Cytokines in particular cytokine storm has recently started to be highly discussed and studied in global viral infections. In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, cytokine storm was seen in many patients. In this study we want to present to perform bibliometric analysis of articles on cytokine and cytokine storm published in the academic literature during 1980 to 2018. Methods: The bibliometric analysis was performed using the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. Results: A total of 232,606 articles were retrieved, 82.52% of which were original articles. The United States was the leading country by total publication number (n=84,426, 36.29%), followed by Japan (n= 21,983, 9.45%) produced the most literature on cytokine. Among the institutions identified, Harvard University (USA) contributed the most articles on cytokine. All authors and institutions in the top 10 contributor’s lists were from the developed countries. Conclusions: Researchers from the developing and least-developed countries should be encouraged to perform novel studies on cytokine.

"This chapter focuses on the mechanisms by which cells express the information stored in genes, and examines the genome coding struggles of different virus groups. Control of gene expression is a vital element of virus replication. Coordinate expression of groups of virus genes results in successive phases of gene expression. Immediate–early genes encode activator proteins, early genes encode further regulatory proteins, and late genes encode virus structural proteins. Viruses make use of the biochemical apparatus of their host cells to express their genetic information as proteins and, consequently, utilize the appropriate biochemical language recognized by the cell. Thus viruses of prokaryotes produce polycistronic mRNAs, while viruses with eukaryotic hosts produce more monocistronic mRNAs. Some viruses of eukaryotes do produce polycistronic mRNA to assist with the coordinate regulation of multiple genes. Viruses rely on specific cis- and trans-acting mechanisms to manipulate the biology of their host cells, and to enhance and coordinate the expression of their genetic information. The chapter discusses control of prokaryote gene expression, expression in bacteriophage λ, eukaryote gene expression, and also discusses genome coding strategies. The chapter ends with a discussion of the transcription and post-transcriptional methods of control of gene expression.",Expression
"The prediction of human diseases precisely is still an uphill battle task for better and timely treatment. A multidisciplinary diabetic disease is a life-threatening disease all over the world. It attacks different vital parts of the human body, like Neuropathy, Retinopathy, Nephropathy, and ultimately Heart. A smart healthcare recommendation system predicts and recommends the diabetic disease accurately using optimal machine learning models with the data fusion technique on healthcare datasets. Various machine learning models and methods have been proposed in the recent past to predict diabetes disease. Still, these systems cannot handle the massive number of multifeatures datasets on diabetes disease properly. A smart healthcare recommendation system is proposed for diabetes disease based on deep machine learning and data fusion perspectives. Using data fusion, we can eliminate the irrelevant burden of system computational capabilities and increase the proposed system's performance to predict and recommend this life-threatening disease more accurately. Finally, the ensemble machine learning model is trained for diabetes prediction. This intelligent recommendation system is evaluated based on a well-known diabetes dataset, and its performance is compared with the most recent developments from the literature. The proposed system achieved 99.6% accuracy, which is higher compared to the existing deep machine learning methods. Therefore, our proposed system is better for multidisciplinary diabetes disease prediction and recommendation. Our proposed system's improved disease diagnosis performance advocates for its employment in the automated diagnostic and recommendation systems for diabetic patients.",A Smart Healthcare Recommendation System for Multidisciplinary Diabetes Patients with Data Fusion Based on Deep Ensemble Learning

"One of the main functions of infrared thermography (IRT) consists in detecting temperature changes in organisms caused by variations in surface blood circulation. IRT is a useful tool that has been used mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies, though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology, IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology, changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures. The aim of this review is to evaluate how IRT can be used as a tool in surgical procedures, cases of vascular change, and pain monitoring in veterinary medicine with an emphasis on small animals.","Advances in infrared thermography: Surgical aspects, vascular changes, and pain monitoring in veterinary medicine"

"Viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) results in varied outcomes ranging from encephalitis, paralytic poliomyelitis or other serious consequences. One of the principal factors that directs the outcome of infection is the localized innate immune response, which is proceeded by the adaptive immune response against the invading viral pathogen. The role of the immune system is to contain and control the spread of virus within the CNS, and paradoxically, this response may also be pathological. Studies with a neurotropic murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have provided important insights into how the immune system combats neuroinvasive viruses, and have identified molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to chronic disease in persistently infected mice.","Mouse hepatitis virus infection of the CNS: a model for defense, disease, and repair."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the trial of novel treatment regimens to improve clinical outcomes. However, the liberal use of antibiotic and steroid therapy during this period may have also contributed to unintended consequences including the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. In this report, we discuss the case of a 76-year-old woman treated with an extended course of steroids for COVID-19 infection. The patient then developed MDR bacterial sinusitis requiring multiple courses of antibiotics complicated by medication side effects. Thus, this case highlights the continued importance of discretion in long-term steroid use and antibiotic stewardship.",Bacterial Sinusitis in the COVID-19 Era: A Reminder for Antibiotic Stewardship
"The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), are both considered the key factors for the initiation of virus infection. The present work is an effort for a computational target to block the spike proteins (S) and ACE2 receptor proteins with Macrolide antibiotics like Azithromycin, (AZM), Clarithromycin (CLAM) and Erythromycin (ERY) along with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These compounds were able to block the residues (Arg553, Arg555, and Ala558) surrounding the deep grove catalytic site (Val557) of RdRp and thus plays an important role in tight blocking of enzyme active site. Reference drug Remdesivir was used to compare the docking score of antibiotics with RdRp. Docking value exhibited good binding energy (-7.7 up to -8.2 kcal/mol) with RdRp, indicating their potential as a potent RdRp inhibitor. Interaction of CLAM and ERY presented low binding energy (-6.8 and -6.6) with the ACE2 receptor. At the same time, CLAM exhibited a good binding affinity of -6.4 kcal/mol, making it an excellent tool to block the attachment of spike protein to ACE2 receptors. Macrolides not only affected the attachment to ACE2 but also blocked the spike proteins further, consequently inhibiting the internalization in the host cell. Three Alkyl bonds between Arg555, Ala558, and Met542 by CLAM and two Alkyl bonds of Arg624 and Lys621 by ERY plays an important role for RdRp inactivation that can prevent the rise of newly budded progeny virus. These macrolides interacted with the main protease protein in the pocket responsible for the dimerization and catalytic function of this protein. The interaction occurred with residue Glu166, along with the catalytic residues (Tyr343, and His235) of Endoribonuclease (NSP15) protein. The present study gives three-way options either by blocking S proteins or ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by macrolide and could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 till some better option available.",The computational intervention of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of COVID-19.

"With cases of COVID-19 still spreading in America, and vaccines still inaccessible or undesired by many, individual mitigation behaviors, such as mask-wearing, remain critical defenses against this deadly virus. This study assessed whether approach-versus-avoidance message framing and goal-orientation affect people's intentions to follow COVID-19 preventative procedures. N = 832 subjects were randomly assigned to view mitigation messaging with either approach or avoidance framing, and either self-protective or altruistic goal-orientation. We observed a significant effect of goal-orientation, such that altruistic (versus self-protective) goal-orientations in messaging lead to stronger intentions to follow mitigation procedures. No significant effect of approach or avoidance framing was found on intentions to follow mitigation procedures. These results suggest an immediate need to address the wording of our public health messages. Adjusting the framing of COVID-19 preventative communications to reflect altruistic goals might increase the effectiveness of communications to protect at-risk populations.",Leveraging Evidence-Based Messaging to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19
"Mucosal surfaces lining the lung and the gut are constantly exposed to environmental antigens, commensal organisms, and pathogens. Consequently, the host’s immune system devotes enormous resources to the defense of these tissues. Although mucosal immune responses must be sufficiently strong to eliminate pathogens, they must also have mechanisms to prevent excessive inflammation and initiate epithelial repair. Importantly, mucosal immune responses are initiated and regulated by a variety of mucosal lymphoid tissues, collectively known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This chapter describes the unique developmental, architectural, and functional features of the MALT and how those features facilitate the local immune response at each site.","Anatomical Uniqueness of the Mucosal Immune System (GALT, NALT, iBALT) for the Induction and Regulation of Mucosal Immunity and Tolerance"
"Early data from several countries regarding the gendered implications of COVID-19 suggest that men are more likely to die as an effect of infection. This has been explained by biological factors but also by behavioral and life-style issues characteristic mostly for men. What has not been widely discussed, however, is the analysis of the relationships between men's responses to the crisis, their (lack of) care activities, and certain models of masculinity that persist in many societies. In this paper, I use a three dimensional model of care – a) self-care, b) care for others, and c) care for one's society – in order to analyze how certain masculine behaviors, rooted in socially constructed gender performances, resonate with the COVID-19 pandemic. The data used in this paper are of secondary character and will serve to analyze the most common responses of men within the three dimensions of care mentioned above. The theoretical framework utilizes the notion of caring masculinity supported by an emerging theory of protective masculinity.

"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents an acute diffuse inflammation of the lungs triggered by different causes, uniformly leading to a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with inhomogeneous densities in lung X-ray and lung CT scan and acute hypoxemia. Edema formation results in “heavy” lungs, inducing loss of compliance and the need to spend more energy to “move” the lungs. Consequently, an ARDS patient, as long as the patient is breathing spontaneously, has an increased respiratory drive to ensure adequate oxygenation and CO(2) removal. One would expect that, once the blood gases get back to “physiological” values, the respiratory drive would normalize and the breathing effort return to its initial status. However, in many ARDS patients, this is not the case; their respiratory drive appears to be upregulated and fully or at least partially detached from the blood gas status. Strikingly, similar alteration of the respiratory drive can be seen in patients suffering from SARS, especially SARS-Covid-19. We hypothesize that alterations of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) related to the pathophysiology of ARDS and SARS are involved in this dysregulation of chemosensitive control of breathing.",A Potential Role of the Renin-Angiotensin-System for Disturbances of Respiratory Chemosensitivity in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
"In 2019 a multidisciplinary research project ""Digital Storytelling Theater"" was launched in Moscow State University of Psychology and Education. The project aims at elaborating, evaluating, and introducing drama technologies into secondary school settings with the goal of applying them as a powerful tool for learning and development. The article focuses on the ways, in which drama can be used for constructing the zone of proximal development in adolescence. It is argued that not any kind of drama-based activities is consistent with the principles of a developing environment in the framework of the Cultural-Historical Paradigm. Creating such a setting is a challenging research task, which requires organization of such types of activity and interaction as role exchanges and reflexive communication. On the example of creating a play with a class of adolescents, it is demonstrated how drama, based on role experimenting, can contribute to overcoming group contradictions, boosting learning motivation and turning personal ""pereghivanije"" into a resource for development (on the experience of living through the pandemic of COVID-19).",Experimenting with Roles in Adolescence: Applying Drama for Constructing the Zone of Proximal Development

"BACKGROUNDIndividuals recovering from COVID-19 frequently experience persistent respiratory ailments, which are key elements of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC); however, little is known about the underlying biological factors that may direct lung recovery and the extent to which these are affected by COVID-19 severity.METHODSWe performed a prospective cohort study of individuals with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19, collecting clinical data, pulmonary function tests, and plasma samples used for multiplex profiling of inflammatory, metabolic, angiogenic, and fibrotic factors.RESULTSSixty-one participants were enrolled across 2 academic medical centers at a median of 9 weeks (interquartile range, 6-10 weeks) after COVID-19 illness: n = 13 participants (21%) had mild COVID-19 and were not hospitalized, n = 30 participants (49%) were hospitalized but were considered noncritical, and n = 18 participants (30%) were hospitalized and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fifty-three participants (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P < 0.05) but these values did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered participants by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), MMP-7, and HGF identified by our analysis were significantly higher in the ICU group (P < 0.05), inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P < 0.05), and were confirmed in a separate validation cohort (n = 53).CONCLUSIONSubjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID-19 illness but do not correlate with COVID-19 severity or pulmonary function.

"In this review, we discuss the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA), which is the master regulator of MHC class II gene expression. CIITA is the founding member of the mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) protein family but stood apart for a long time as the only transcriptional regulator. More recently, it was found that its closest homolog, NLRC5 (NLR protein caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing 5), is a regulator of MHC-I gene expression. Both act as non-DNA-binding activators through multiple protein–protein interactions with an MHC enhanceosome complex that binds cooperatively to a highly conserved combinatorial cis-acting module. Thus, the regulation of MHC-II expression is regulated largely through the differential expression of CIITA. In addition to the well-defined role of CIITA in MHC-II GENE regulation, we will discuss several other aspects of CIITA functions, such as its role in cancer, its role as a viral restriction element contributing to intrinsic immunity, and lastly, its very recently discovered role as an inhibitor of Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 virus replication. We will briefly touch upon the recently discovered role of NLRP3 as a transcriptional regulator, which suggests that transcriptional regulation is, after all, not such an unusual feature for NLR proteins.",The MHC Class II Transactivator CIITA: Not (Quite) the Odd-One-Out Anymore among NLR Proteins

"Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), found in the bone marrow and peripheral blood as rare cell population, demonstrated a high proliferation and differentiation capacity. Understanding how such diseases influence the quantity and functionality of EPCs is essential for the development of novel therapies. This study aims to investigate the factors that affect the quantity and functionality of circulating EPCs in stroke patients and healthy controls. Blood samples were collected once from healthy donors (n = 30) and up to 3 times (within 7 days (baseline), 3 and 12 months post-stroke) from stroke patients (n = 207). EPC subpopulations were isolated with flow cytometry for characterization. The Matrigel tubular formation assay was performed as a measure of functionality. An increased amount of circulating EPCs was observed in stroke patients over 45 years when compared to age-matched healthy individuals. EPCs showed a rising trend in stroke patients over the 12-month post-stroke period, reaching statistical significance at 12 months post-stroke. Isolated CD34(+)KDR(+) cells from stroke patients showed impairment in tubular formation capability when compared to cells from healthy donors. The quantity and vasculogenic function of circulating EPCs in peripheral blood have been effectively evaluated in stroke patients and healthy control donors in this study. Age and stroke are found to be 2 influencing factors on the angiogenic capacity. It is suggested that the increase in EPC number is triggered by the recovery response following ischemic stroke.

"BACKGROUND: eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) are an evolving trend in the medical field. The acceptance of digital tools is high, and the need is growing. OBJECTIVE: Young adults (18-40 years) confronted with a cancer diagnosis present unique needs and require special care. They often have a strong affinity and are familiar with modern technology. On that account, we implemented a web-based symptom and quality of life (QoL) assessment to address patients' attitudes and willingness to use mHealth tools. The study also aims to evaluate sociodemographic parameters that could influence patients' opinions. METHODS: A total of 380 young patients aged 18-40 treated with radiotherapy between 2002 and 2017 were included in the trial. We assessed QoL via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core 30 (EORTC C30) questionnaire and added general questions about mHealth technology. The added questions inquired patients' opinions regarding general aspects, including technical advances in medicine, mobile and app assistance during cancer treatment, data transfer, and app-specific features. The survey was conducted for 12 months. Participation was voluntary and pseudonymized; prior written consent was obtained. RESULTS: We achieved a participation rate of 57.6% (219/380) and a completion rate of 50.2% (110/219). The median age was 33 years (range 18-40). Of all participants, 89.1% (98/110) considered new technologies in medicine as positive; 10.9% (12/110) answered with neutral. Nearly all patients (96.4%, 106/110) stated that they would send further data via a web-based platform. Of all, 96.4% (106/110) considered the provided pseudonymization of their data as safe. We further asked the patients if they would use a mobile app for symptom and QoL assessment similar to the present web-based system: 74.5% (82/110) answered with yes and 25.5% (28/110) said they would not use a mobile app in the future. We tested the willingness to use an app on several sociodemographic parameters, such as age, gender, education, health insurance status, and cancer-related parameters: tumor stage, time since radiation treatment, and treatment intention. None of these parameters correlated with app use in this group of young adults. Patients who were generally positive regarding using an app rated several possible functions of a future app. The 3 most requested features were appointment reminders (89.0%, 73/82), contact overview of all involved clinics and physicians (87%, 71/82), and making an appointment via app (78%, 64/82). CONCLUSIONS: eHealth and mHealth tools should be available as an integrated part of a comprehensive cancer care approach. It provides automated, thorough documentation of health parameters during therapy and follow-up for doctors, medical staff, and tumor patients to optimize treatment. With this study, we could show that young adults are the ideal patient population to use eHealth/mHealth tools. Such tools offer further digital support and improve the patients' need for constant QoL during cancer care.",Web-Based Patient Self-Reported Outcome After Radiotherapy in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: Survey on Acceptance of Digital Tools
"Plant defensive mimicry based on the aphid alarm pheromone (E)-ß-farnesene (EßF) was previously shown to operate in Tanacetum cinerariifolium (Asteraceae) flowers. Germacrene D (GD), is another dominant volatile of T. cinerariifolium flowers and may modulate both defense and pollination. Here, we find that the increase in GD/EßF ratio at later developmental stages is correlated with the tissue distribution in the flower head: the total content of EßF and GD is similar, but GD accumulates comparatively more in the upper disk florets. Naphthol and N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (NADI)-stained purple ducts containing EßF and GD, were observed in the five petal lips of the corolla and two-lobed stigma of disk florets. By contrast in the peduncle, EßF accounts for nearly 80% of total terpenes, compared to 5% for GD. EßF is accumulated inside inner cortex cells and parenchyma cells of the pith in young peduncle. This is followed by the formation of terpene-filled axial secretory cavities parallel to the vascular bundles. In conclusion, the observed developmental and diurnal emissions of different EßF/GD ratios appear to be regulated by their tissue distribution.",Tissue specificity of (E)-ß-farnesene and germacrene D accumulation in pyrethrum flowers

"BACKGROUND Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to transform infectious disease testing. Uniquely, infectious disease testing is technologically diverse spaces in laboratory medicine, where multiple platforms and approaches may be required to support clinical decision-making. Despite advances in laboratory informatics, the vast array of infectious disease data is constrained by human analytical limitations. Machine learning can exploit multiple data streams, including but not limited to laboratory information and overcome human limitations to provide physicians with predictive and actionable results. As a quickly evolving area of computer science, laboratory professionals should become aware of AI/ML applications for infectious disease testing as more platforms are become commercially available. CONTENT In this review we: (a) define both AI/ML, (b) provide an overview of common ML approaches used in laboratory medicine, (c) describe the current AI/ML landscape as it relates infectious disease testing, and (d) discuss the future evolution AI/ML for infectious disease testing in both laboratory and point-of-care applications. SUMMARY The review provides an important educational overview of AI/ML technique in the context of infectious disease testing. This includes supervised ML approaches, which are frequently used in laboratory medicine applications including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, sepsis, hepatitis, malaria, meningitis, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis.

"BACKGROUND/AIM: The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was officially recorded on March 11, 2020. Social media use increased worldwide, as well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. RESULTS: In the pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between influencers and other users in the network was determined. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network analysis would help reduce the “infodemic” before administering the vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively in this regard.",The dramatic increase in anti-vaccine discourses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a social network analysis of Twitter
"The surge of SARS-CoV-2 has created a wave of pandemic around the globe due to its high transmission rate. To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.",Immunogenicity and antigenicity based T-cell and B-cell epitopes identification from conserved regions of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
"In the past decade, deep learning (DL) has achieved unprecedented success in numerous fields, such as computer vision and healthcare. Particularly, DL is experiencing an increasing development in advanced medical image analysis applications in terms of segmentation, classification, detection, and other tasks. On the one hand, tremendous needs that leverage DL’s power for medical image analysis arise from the research community of a medical, clinical, and informatics background to share their knowledge, skills, and experience jointly. On the other hand, barriers between disciplines are on the road for them, often hampering a full and efficient collaboration. To this end, we propose our novel open-source platform, i.e., MEDAS–the MEDical open-source platform As Service. To the best of our knowledge, MEDAS is the first open-source platform providing collaborative and interactive services for researchers from a medical background using DL-related toolkits easily and for scientists or engineers from informatics modeling faster. Based on tools and utilities from the idea of RINV (Rapid Implementation aNd Verification), our proposed platform implements tools in pre-processing, post-processing, augmentation, visualization, and other phases needed in medical image analysis. Five tasks, concerning lung, liver, brain, chest, and pathology, are validated and demonstrated to be efficiently realizable by using MEDAS. MEDAS is available at http://medas.bnc.org.cn/.",MEDAS: an open-source platform as a service to help break the walls between medicine and informatics
"Study Objectives: This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of participation in nature-oriented outdoor sports activities on Coronavirus-19 phobia during the pandemic process. Methods: The population of the cross-sectional study consists of 289 people who were engaged in nature-oriented outdoor sports activities in the Tunceli region between 28.06.2021 and 20.07.2021. Results: COVID-19 phobia was statistically higher in women, people under 35, singles, those with high school or lower education, and those who do not have children. Although many nature sports activities reduce the phobia of COVID-19, there was especially a statistically significant decrease in COVID-19 phobia among those who engage in rock climbing. Besides, those who practiced outdoor sports with fear of death and quarantine had a statistically higher COVID-19 phobia score. There was a weakly significant negative relationship between the years of experience, the number of types of outdoor sports activities that the individuals engage in, and the COVID-19 phobia score. As the years of experience in these activities and their types increased, the COVID-19 phobia decreased, albeit weakly. Conclusion: Performing nature-oriented outdoor sports activities from different fields can be beneficial, even partially, in reducing the phobia caused by COVID-19. In pandemics, such as COVID-19, which have a wide range of negative effects on society, individuals can be directed to nature sports against COVID-19 phobia.",Reflections of Nature-Oriented Outdoor Sports Activities on Coronavirus-19 Phobia During the Pandemic Process
"BACKGROUND: The myofascial system plays a fundamental role in the mechanics of the body, in body tension regulation and the etiology of pathological states like chronic pain. Moreover, it contains contractile elements and preliminary evidence suggests that its properties are linked to psychological factors. The aim of the present research was to investigate characteristics of the myofascial tissue in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and to examine whether the state of the myofascial tissue causally affects pathopsychological processes in MDD. METHODS: In Study 1, stiffness and elasticity of the myofascial tissue of 40 inpatients suffering from MDD measured with a tissue compliance meter were compared with those of 40 matched never-depressed participants. In Study 2, 69 MDD patients were randomly assigned to single-session self-myofascial release intervention (SMRI) or a placebo intervention. Effects on memory bias and affect were investigated. RESULTS: Results showed that MDD patients displayed heightened stiffness and reduced elasticity of the myofascial tissue and that patients in the SMRI group showed a reduced negative memory bias and more positive affect compared to patients in the placebo condition. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results of our studies indicate that the myofascial tissue might be part of a dysfunctional body-mind dynamic that maintains MDD.

"Improved understanding and management of COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease, could greatly reduce the threat posed by its etiologic agent, SARS-CoV-2. Toward this end, we have identified a core peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated patients with COVID-19 who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The signature includes discrete changes in B and myelomonocytic cell composition, profoundly altered T cell phenotypes, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Some signature traits identify links with other settings of immunoprotection and immunopathology; others, including basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion, correlate strongly with disease severity; while a third set of traits, including a triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression. Hence, contingent upon independent validation in other COVID-19 cohorts, individual traits within this signature may collectively and individually guide treatment options; offer insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis; and aid early, risk-based patient stratification that is particularly beneficial in phasic diseases such as COVID-19.",A dynamic COVID-19 immune signature includes associations with poor prognosis.

"Type I interferons (IFN‐I) have been known for decades for their indispensable role in curtailing viral infections. It is, however, now also increasingly recognized that IFN‐I is detrimental to the host in combating a number of bacterial infections. We have previously reported that viral infections induce partial lymphocyte activation, characterized by significant increases in the cell surface expression of CD69 and CD86, but not CD25. This systemic partial activation of lymphocytes, mediated by IFN‐I, is rapid and is followed by a period of IFN‐I unresponsiveness. Here we propose that IFN‐I exhaustion that occurs soon after a primary viral infection may be a host response protecting it from secondary bacterial infections.",Type I IFN Exhaustion is a Host Defence Protecting Against Secondary Bacterial Infections
"The complete genomic nucleotide sequence (29.7kb) of a Hong Kong severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain HK-39 is determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomic sequence reveals it to be a distinct member of the Coronaviridae family. 5' RACE assay confirms the presence of at least six subgenomic transcripts all containing the predicted intergenic sequences. Five open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1a, 1b, S, M, and N, are found to be homologues to other CoV members, and three more unknown ORFs (X1, X2, and X3) are unparalleled in all other known CoV species. Optimal alignment and computer analysis of the homologous ORFs has predicted the characteristic structural and functional domains on the putative genes. The overall nucleotides conservation of the homologous ORFs is low (<5%) compared with other known CoVs, implying that HK-39 is a newly emergent SARS-CoV phylogenetically distant from other known members. SimPlot analysis supports this finding, and also suggests that this novel virus is not a product of a recent recombinant from any of the known characterized CoVs. Together, these results confirm that HK-39 is a novel and distinct member of the Coronaviridae family, with unknown origin. The completion of the genomic sequence of the virus will assist in tracing its origin.",The complete genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain HKU-39849 (HK-39).
"Refundable income annuities (IA), such as cash-refund and instalment-refund, differ in material ways from the life-only version beloved by economists. In addition to lifetime income they guarantee the annuitant or beneficiary will receive their money back albeit slowly over time. We document that refundable IAs now represent the majority of sales in the U.S., yet they are mostly ignored by insurance and pension economists. And, although their pricing, duration, and money's-worth-ratio is complicated by recursivity which will be explained, we offer a path forward to make refundable IAs tractable. A key result concerns the market price of cash-refund IAs, when the actuarial present value is grossed-up by an insurance loading. We prove that price is counterintuitively no longer a declining function of age and older buyers might pay more than younger ones. Moreover, there exists a threshold valuation rate below which no price is viable. This may also explain why inflation-adjusted IAs have all but disappeared.",Refundable income annuities: Feasibility of money-back guarantees
"Once considered unusual, nucleocytoplasmic glycosylation is now recognized as a conserved feature of eukaryotes. While in animals, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modifies thousands of intracellular proteins, the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii transfers a different sugar, fucose, to proteins involved in transcription, mRNA processing, and signaling. Knockout experiments showed that TgSPY, an ortholog of plant SPINDLY and paralog of host OGT, is required for nuclear O-fucosylation. Here we verify that TgSPY is the nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) by 1) complementation with TgSPY-MYC(3), 2) its functional dependence on amino acids critical for OGT activity, and 3) its ability to O-fucosylate itself and a model substrate and to specifically hydrolyze GDP-Fuc. While many of the endogenous proteins modified by O-Fuc are important for tachyzoite fitness, O-fucosylation by TgSPY is not essential. Growth of Δspy tachyzoites in fibroblasts is modestly affected, despite marked reductions in the levels of ectopically expressed proteins normally modified with O-fucose. Intact TgSPY-MYC(3) localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas catalytic mutants often displayed reduced abundance. Δspy tachyzoites of a luciferase-expressing type II strain exhibited infection kinetics in mice similar to wild-type but increased persistence in the chronic brain phase, potentially due to an imbalance of regulatory protein levels. The modest changes in parasite fitness in vitro and in mice, despite profound effects on reporter protein accumulation, and the characteristic punctate localization of O-fucosylated proteins suggest that TgSPY controls the levels of proteins to be held in reserve for response to novel stresses.",The nucleocytosolic O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY affects protein expression and virulence in Toxoplasma gondii
"The novel coronavirus pandemic outbreak caused extreme public fear, health concerns, and psychological distress, especially in oncology patients. The presented rare case is of a 40-year-old female with thymoma type B, with rapid progression, due to fear from the COVID-19 pandemic. Biopsy and histological verification of the tumor show a B-type thymoma with a high proliferative index. The fear of infection is causing avoidant behavior and leads to suboptimal therapy in some oncology patients that will have severe consequences. We can conclude that adequate, personalized, and most importantly, active psychological care is necessary and should be implemented for cancer patients. To be prepared for a future lockdown, it may be helpful to urge patients to seek alternative forms of social contact, such as online and mobile communications, to combat depression lockdown effects.","Thymoma type B2 progression, due to fear of contamination, in association with hydrocephalus: A case report of avoidant behavior during COVID-19 pandemic"
"BACKGROUND: Literature shows a high prevalence of psychological distress (PD) as well as common mental disorders (CMD) such as major depressive disorders (MDD), generalized anxiety disorders (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and substance misuse disorders (SUD) among people exposed to disasters and pandemics like the COVID-19. Moreover, CMD are associated with increased mortality (mainly through suicide) and morbidity (loss of productivity). A number of countries have made deliberate efforts to identify and manage CMD in light of COVID-19. However, low levels of mental health literacy (MHL) manifested by the individual’s unawareness of CMD symptoms, limited human and mental health infrastructure resources, and high levels of mental illness stigma (MIS) are barriers to integration of mental health care in general health care during pandemics and epidemics such as the COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: For the proposed study, we will determine effectiveness of a psycho-education intervention delivered by village health team (VHT) members. METHODS: We will employ a cluster randomized trial design in 24 villages in central Uganda. We will collect baseline data to and document the prevalence of MHL, PD, MDD, PTSD, GAD, and SUD. We will distribute information education and communication materials (IEC) aimed at improving MHL to 420 adult individuals in the intervention arm (n = 12 villages). In the control arm (n = 12 villages), VHTs will distribute ministry of health COVID-19 information leaflets to 420 participants. Within 7 days of distributing the materials, research assistants will conduct a follow-up interview and assess for the same parameters (MHL, PD, MDD, PTSD, GAD, and SUD). We will use an intention to treat analysis to estimate the effectiveness of the psycho-education intervention.

"We previously showed that potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 9 (KCTD9) is aberrantly expressed in natural killer (NK) cells in patients with hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure and mice with experimental fulminant hepatitis. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of NK cell function and fulminant hepatitis progression by KCTD9 is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Kctd9 in regulation of early development, maturation, and function of NK cells using Kctd9-knockout mice. Compared to wild-type mice, Kctd9-deficient mice exhibited impaired NK cell lineage commitment, as evidenced by selective reduction in the refined NK progenitors, and incomplete NK cell maturation, as manifested by a higher proportion of CD11b(−) NK cells and a lower percentage of CD11b(+) NK cells with high proliferative potential. Moreover, Kctd9-depleted NK cells displayed insufficient IFN-γ production, degranulation, and granzyme B production in response to cytokine stimulation, and attenuated cytotoxicity to tumor cells in vitro. The defect in NK cells was further supported by ameliorated liver damage and improved survival in Kctd9-deficient mice following murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection, which otherwise leads to immune-mediated fulminant hepatitis, a phenotype homologous to that caused by NK cell depletion in wild-type mice. Further investigation to identify the underlying mechanism revealed that Kctd9 deficiency hindered the expression of transcription factors, including Ets1, Nfil3, Eomes, and Id2 in NK cells. Collectively, our data reveal that Kctd9 acts as a novel regulator for NK cell commitment, maturation, and effector function.",Kctd9 Deficiency Impairs Natural Killer Cell Development and Effector Function
"Phylogenetic and pathogenesis studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) strains have highlighted some specific mutations that could confer the RNA genome fitness advantages and immunological resistance for their rapid spread in the human population. The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge.","Immunity, virus evolution, and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines"

"Abstract Background . The global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an urgent search for effective interventions. SARS-CoV-2 mortality/morbidity risk increases with age and for those chronic disease co-morbidities, both of which are associated with lower zinc status, as is the risk of infection. Methods Rapid review methods will be applied to a systematic review of zinc for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and viral respiratory tract infections in humans. Included are published studies reporting randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compare zinc intervention to placebo and/or other comparator interventions. English and Chinese language databases will be searched for primary studies of viral respiratory tract infections and clinical trial registries for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Due to concerns about indirectness, studies evaluating non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections will be rated down by one level, and non-specific or confirmed non-coronavirus viral infections will be rated down by two levels. Review constraints include 1) using Google translate when screening articles published in languages other than English or Chinese and limited translation 2) following calibration, only one reviewer will screen articles, extract data, appraise quality and conduct the analysis, 3) prioritising data extraction and meta-analyses of SARS-CoV-2 studies and critical outcomes of other viral infections, followed by high risk groups and 4) reporting important preliminary findings prior to peer review if necessary. Discussion . The application of these rapid review methods and broadening the inclusion criteria to include other coronavirus-related viral respiratory tract infections aims to enable a timely evidence appraisal of priority research questions and dissemination of results.",Rapid review protocol: zinc for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related respiratory tract infections
"Ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive yet effective medical diagnostic imaging technique for the COVID-19 global pandemic However, due to complex feature behaviors and expensive annotations of US images, it is difficult to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisting approaches for the lung's multi-symptom (multi-label) classification To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel semi-supervised Two-Stream Active Learning (TSAL) method to model complicated features and reduce labeling costs in an iterative manner The core component of TSAL is the multi-label learning mechanism, in which label correlation information is used to design a multi-label margin (MLM) strategy and a confidence validation for automatically selecting informative samples and confident labels In this framework, a multi-symptom multi-label (MSML) classification network is proposed to learn discriminative features of lung symptoms, and a human-machine interaction (HMI) is exploited to confirm the final annotations that are used to fine-Tune MSML Moreover, a novel lung US dataset named COVID19-LUSMS is built, currently containing 71 clinical patients with 6, 836 images sampled from 678 videos Experimental evaluations show that TSAL can achieve superior performance to the baseline and the state-of-The-Art using only 20% data Qualitatively, visualization of the attention map confirms a good consistency between the model prediction and the clinical knowledge © 2020 IEEE",Semi-Supervised Active Learning for COVID-19 Lung Ultrasound Multi-symptom Classification
"Introduction: Mucormycosis is a life-threatening angio-invasive infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. In India, the second wave of the COVID pandemic, primarily driven by the delta variant, led to a surge in cases of mucormycosis. The majority of these cases occurred following recovery from COVID, and resulted in increased morbidity and mortality. Here we present a series of five kidney transplant recipients (KTR’s) who presented with COVID-related mucormycosis. Methods: This is a single-centre, prospective, observational study that included all KTRs who presented to Madras Medical College with COVID-related mucormycosis between May 2021 and August 2021. Relevant clinical details and laboratory data were collected, therapeutic interventions were recorded, and outcomes of hospitalization were noted. Results: Five patients developed COVID-related mucormycosis during the study period. Their clinical details and hospital course are summarized in Table 1. Only one patient had received COVID vaccination (2 doses of covishield). All patients had underlying post-transplant diabetes mellitus, with severe hyperglycemia at admission. They all received intravenous dexamethasone for COVID pneumonia. Mucormycosis developed 10-21 days after recovery from COVID in four patients;one patient developed both infections concurrently. All patients received liposomal Amphotericin B, with four patients also undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Acute graft dysfunction occurred in all five patients;three had complete renal recovery, one had partial renal recovery, and one patient died during hospitalisation. [Formula presented] Conclusions: All five KTR’s in our series who developed COVID-related mucormycosis had acute graft dysfunction. They all had multiple risk factors that included elements of hyperglycemia, sepsis and nephrotoxic drugs (amphotericin B).

"Background: In times of global public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses stand at the front line, working in close contact with infected individuals. Being actively engaged in fighting against COVID-19 exposes nurses to a high risk of being infected but can also have a serious impact on their mental health, as they are faced with excessive workload and emotional burden in many front-line operating contexts. Purpose: The aim of the study is to analyze how risk factors such as perceived impact, preparedness to the pandemic, and worries were associated with mental health outcomes (crying, rumination and stress) in nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was performed via an online questionnaire survey. Participants included 894 registered nurses from Italy. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Multiple binary logistic regression was carried out to analyze the relationship between risk factors and health outcomes. Results: Increased job stress was related to higher levels of rumination about the pandemic (OR = 4.04, p < 0.001), job demand (OR = 2.00, p < 0.001), impact on job role (OR = 2.56, p < 0.001), watching coworkers crying at work (OR = 1.50, p < 0.05), non-work-related concerns (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), and fear of getting infected (OR = 2.05, p < 0.001). Job stress (OR = 2.52, p < 0.01), rumination (OR = 2.28, p < 0.001), and watching colleagues crying (OR = 7.92, p < 0.001) were associated with crying at work. Rumination was associated with caring for patients who died of COVID-19 (OR = 1.54, p < 0.05), job demand (OR = 1.70, p < 0.01), watching colleagues crying (OR = 1.81, p < 0.001), non-work-related worries (OR = 1.57, p < 0.05), and fear of getting infected (OR = 2.02, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The psychological impact that this pandemic may cause in the medium/long term could be greater than the economical one. This is the main challenge that health organizations will have to face in the future. This study highlights that the perceived impact and worries about the pandemic affect nurses' mental health and can impact on their overall effectiveness during the pandemic. Measures to enhance nurses' protection and to lessen the risk of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress should be planned promptly.","Worries, Preparedness, and Perceived Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Nurses' Mental Health"

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly spread over the world and kills infected patients. There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label. Off-label uses are not under regulation in the outbreak because there is no specific regulation for this condition. OBJECTIVES: In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use. Further, we will describe the third way of off-label use, we named it pseudo-research and then we will state the most possible ethical challenges of off-label use for better perceptions and responsibility. RESULTS: The WHO considers off-label uses as country-specific. All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician's responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements. There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice. CONCLUSION: There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive. Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational. Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.",COVID-19 and off label use of drugs: an ethical viewpoint
"Amelioration of immune overactivity during sepsis is key to restoring hemodynamics, microvascular blood flow, and tissue oxygenation, and in preventing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome that results from sepsis ultimately leads to degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx and subsequently increased vascular leakage. Current fluid resuscitation techniques only transiently improve outcomes in sepsis, and can cause edema. Nitric oxide (NO) treatment for sepsis has shown promise in the past, but implementation is difficult due to the challenges associated with delivery and the transient nature of NO. To address this, we tested the anti-inflammatory efficacy of sustained delivery of exogenous NO using i.v. infused NO releasing nanoparticles (NO-np). The impact of NO-np on microhemodynamics and immune response in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia mouse model was evaluated. NO-np treatment significantly attenuated the pro-inflammatory response by promoting M2 macrophage repolarization, which reduced the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and slowed vascular extravasation. Combined, this resulted in significantly improved microvascular blood flow and 72-h survival of animals treated with NO-np. The results from this study suggest that sustained supplementation of endogenous NO ameliorates and may prevent the morbidities of acute systemic inflammatory conditions. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator in many acute inflammatory conditions, it is likely that NO enhancement strategies may be useful for the treatment of sepsis and other acute inflammatory insults that trigger severe systemic pro-inflammatory responses and often result in a cytokine storm, as seen in COVID-19.",Control of systemic inflammation through early nitric oxide supplementation with nitric oxide releasing nanoparticles
"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus on January 12, 2020, and has declared a public health emergency globally on January 30, 2020. The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and quickly spread to over 200 countries. COVID-19 can cause multiple organ injuries (e.g., kidney, heart, blood, and nervous system). Among them, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical complication due to its high incidence and mortality rate. So, it is essential to evaluate AKI in COVID-19 patients during this pandemic state. The aim of this work is to detect the occurrence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So, a retrospective study was conducted on hospitalized adult patients > 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the Abo Teeg Hospital at Assiut City, Egypt, from May 1, 2020, to July 1, 2020. All data were collected from medical records, patients’ follow-up, and charts. Data were verified, coded by the researcher, and analyzed using IBM-SPSS 21.0. RESULTS: Eighty-six COVID-19 patients were admitted to Abo Teeg Hospital in Assiut City, Egypt, between May and July 2020. Thirty-eight patients (33%) were of the male gender. Mean age was 58.07 ± 17.9, and 61 patients developed AKI. 32.8% of the AKI group were a stage I severity (increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h), 21.3% of them presented by stage II (2–2.9 times increase in serum creatinine), and 45.9% were in stage III (3 times or more increase in serum creatinine). The overall hospital mortality for the patients admitted to ICU with AKI was 6.7% (11/61), compared to 1% (4/25) in those without AKI. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of AKI, and we recommended that those patients should be evaluated after discharge for the development of CKD.",Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (retrospective study)
"This study reports on parent-child dynamics following COVID-19 related school closures, based on cross-sectional analyses of a survey that utilized a convenience sampling approach. Data were collected approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor's degree. 78% of parents said they were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.",Parenting activities and the transition to home-based education during the COVID-19 pandemic
"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has seriously affected the treatment of patients and social stability. In the later stage of disease, some COVID-19 patients may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure. However, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease is cytokine storm. At present, some therapies such as interleukin-6 antibody blocker, stem cell therapy, and transfusion of convalescent plasma have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm and have made some progress. This article reviews the influences of cytokine storm syndrome on the COVID-19 and the corresponding immunotherapies to resist cytokine storm.",[Advances in the research of cytokine storm mechanism induced by Corona Virus Disease 2019 and the corresponding immunotherapies]

"This paper is the first to examine the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to COVID-19 in terms of volatility resilience. Seven GARCH-type models are used to measure, predict, and audit the volatility behavior of the most eminent cryptocurrencies that represent almost 60% of the total crypto market namely, Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). The in-sample period extends from January 1, 2015 up to November 30, 2019 and the out-of-sample period covers the COVID-19 period spanning from December 1, 2019 up to April 6, 2021. Results showed that CGARCH (1,1) and GARCH (1,1) are the prevailing models to forecast the volatility of Bitcoin and Ripple respectively in both the in- and out-of-sample periods and that advanced GARCH models appear to better predict asymmetries in cryptocurrencies’ volatilities pre and post COVID-19. Also, the COVID-19 contributed in significantly affecting the volatility of Bitcoin, Ripple, Monero and Dash. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Modeling the Resilience of the Cryptocurrency Market to COVID-19
"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. RESULTS: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (ß = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (ß = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (ß = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest the targeted psychological intervention measures should be developed to improve the mental health of non-medical workers on the front-line of COVID-19 epidemic, especially the females and younger individuals.",Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan
"After more than six months of the COVID-19 pandemic some of its effects to higher education have been already documented. The higher education institutions around the world rushed to teach online, most of them without any preparation and in some cases in public universities their authorities imposing the technology to be used, the school calendar and new labor relations. At the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana more than a third of the students considers that learning online has been minimum or null and 76.1% of their professors use their own equipment to teach online and 74.6% work more hours than the established in their contracts. At the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, 20% of its students did not take classes online and 10% of their professors did not teach online. In this paper some of the negative effects of COVID-19 to higher education are referred and discussed, among them, the effects on the salary inequality. Some recommendations are offered to the institutions in their return to “normal” activities. © 2021, North American Business Press.

"INTRODUCTION: Hundreds of thousands of cholecystectomies and appendectomies are performed in the United States annually. Due to the prevalence of cholecystitis and appendicitis, a subset of patients will require both operations. The limited literature describing these patients supports a laparoscopic approach over open surgery; consistent with the advantages of laparotomy over open surgery in the treatment of each condition individually. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases where a patient presented with cholecystitis and appendicitis simultaneously. An abdominal computer tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of the two diagnoses, which was then confirmed by an abdominal ultrasound. A four-access port was utilized for simultaneous appendectomy and cholecystectomy. DISCUSSION: A review of the literature indicates that simultaneous infection with appendicitis and cholecystitis is rare, and thus clinical presentation, lab work, and imaging studies are all needed to support such a diagnosis. Potential findings on imaging in these patients may include distended gallbladder with thickened wall and fluid-filled dilated appendix with mural enhancement. In the event that both clinical presentation and further work-up indicate both pathologies, laparoscopic intervention is suitable. A four-access port is deemed the conservative approach to dealing with such cases. CONCLUSION: Finding a single diagnosis responsible for a patient's illness is a high priority in an acute care setting, a concept known as diagnostic parsimony. However, it is inevitable that very common illnesses will be comorbid in a subset of patients, and physicians should be prepared to consider contemporaneous illness in the isolated circumstances it is warranted.",Synchronous presentation of acute cholecystitis and acute appendicitis successful treatment in one step laparoscopic procedure.

"COVID-19 abatement strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to repeating waves of infection. We show—as proof of concept grounded on rigorous mathematical evidence—that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements over short time scales. In turn—while not eliminating the virus—this fast switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of 1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown mitigation. All code is available on Github at https://github.com/V4p1d/FPSP_Covid19. A software tool has also been developed so that interested parties can explore the proof-of-concept system.",Post-lockdown abatement of COVID-19 by fast periodic switching
"Cannabis and ecstasy are illicit substances, and currently, there are no approved treatments for methamphetamine (METH) use disorder. Some studies have proposed that cannabidiol (CBD) decreases the motivation for METH seeking, but reports indicate that the therapeutic benefits are only for heroin. Here, we studied the interaction between CBD and METH during the sensitization phase on the rewarding effect of METH, using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to measure possible alterations in sensitivity. Our data showed that i. p. injection of METH created METH-induced CPP at two of the highest applied doses (1 and 2 mg/kg), and injection of METH during the sensitization period caused an establishment of METH-induced CPP at lower doses (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). Data also revealed that i. c.v. administration of CBD during the sensitization phase, shifted the establishment of METH-induced CPP toward a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg). Concurrent administration of CBD (10 μg/5 μl, i. c.v.) and METH (0.25 mg/kg, i. p.) during sensitization phase established METH-induced CPP with sub-threshold doses of METH (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg). Our results suggest the involvement of CBD and prior exposure to METH in creating sensitization to METH CPP.",Cannabidiol enhanced the development of sensitization to the expression of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference in male rats.
"Pre-training lays the foundation for recent successes in radiograph analysis supported by deep learning. It learns transferable image representations by conducting large-scale fully-supervised or self-supervised learning on a source domain. However, supervised pre-training requires a complex and labor intensive two-stage human-assisted annotation process while self-supervised learning cannot compete with the supervised paradigm. To tackle these issues, we propose a cross-supervised methodology named REviewing FreE-text Reports for Supervision (REFERS), which acquires free supervision signals from original radiology reports accompanying the radiographs. The proposed approach employs a vision transformer and is designed to learn joint representations from multiple views within every patient study. REFERS outperforms its transfer learning and self-supervised learning counterparts on 4 well-known X-ray datasets under extremely limited supervision. Moreover, REFERS even surpasses methods based on a source domain of radiographs with human-assisted structured labels. Thus REFERS has the potential to replace canonical pre-training methodologies.",Generalized Radiograph Representation Learning via Cross-supervision between Images and Free-text Radiology Reports
"Some respiratory viruses have long been known to cause neurological involvement A novel coronavirus, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome, also called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), seems to be a new member of neuroinvasive viruses While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps on spreading around the world rapidly, reports about the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2, increases day by day It is reported that a variety of symptoms and syndromes such as headache, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain and myopathy are common especially in more severe COVID-19 patients It is also suggested that the development of neurological complications is strongly associated with a poor outcome On the other hand, hyposmia can be the unique symptom in COVID-19 carriers and this can serve as a marker for identifying the otherwise asymptomatically infected patients It is thought that SARSCoV-2 may cause neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms Nevertheless, neuroinvasion capability of SARS-CoV2 is confirmed by the presence of the virus, in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient with encephalitis, and this is proven by gene sequencing In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to be aware of the possible neurological complications of the disease Therefore, in this review, we aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms Due to the high homology of SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, reviewing the neurological involvement also associated with these coronaviruses will provide an idea about the longterm complications of COVID-19 (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the point of view of neurologists: Observation of neurological findings and symptoms during the combat against a pandemic

"Humoral immune responses initiate in the lymph node draining the site of viral infection (dLN). Some viruses subvert LN B cell activation; however, our knowledge of viral hindrance of B cell responses of important human pathogens is lacking. Here, we define mechanisms whereby chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted RNA virus that causes outbreaks of acute and chronic arthritis in humans, hinders dLN antiviral B cell responses. Infection of WT mice with pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, induced MyD88-dependent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. Blocking this influx improved lymphocyte accumulation, dLN organization, and CHIKV-specific B cell responses. Both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) contributed to impaired dLN organization and function. Infiltrating monocytes expressed iNOS through a local IRF5- and IFNAR1-dependent pathway that was partially TLR7-dependent. Together, our data suggest that pathogenic CHIKV triggers the influx and activation of monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN that impairs virus-specific B cell responses.","MyD88-dependent influx of monocytes and neutrophils impairs lymph node B cell responses to chikungunya virus infection via Irf5, Nos2 and Nox2"

"Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is a major cause of death and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries, however, the etiologic agents are often undetermined due to the lack of molecular diagnostics in hospitals and clinics. To examine evidence for select viral infections among patients with SARI in northern Vietnam, we studied 348 nasopharyngeal samples from military and civilian patients admitted to 4 hospitals in the greater Hanoi area from 2017–2019. Initial screening for human respiratory viral pathogens was performed in Hanoi, Vietnam at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) or the Military Institute of Preventative Medicine (MIPM), and an aliquot was shipped to Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore for validation. Patient demographics were recorded and used to epidemiologically describe the infections. Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%). Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7–22.9). As influenza A and B viruses were commonly associated with SARI and are treatable, SARI patients entering these hospitals would benefit if the hospitals were able to adapt onsite molecular diagnostics.","Virus detections among patients with severe acute respiratory illness, Northern Vietnam"

"In the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees' access to information has become increasingly important given the rapid change in the scientific and public health knowledge-base. However, this access is complicated by social distancing requirements that disrupt traditional in-person communication. Many refugees must then rely on alternative information sources to stay informed. Differences in media types and information sources in turn may be related to anxieties arising from the virus and perceptions of others' adherence to recommended protective behaviors. We examine these relationships with survey data from 1,000 refugees living in both camps and non-camp settings in Kenya. Using logit models, we test relationships between information source and anxiety and the effect of these variables on refugees' expected behaviors of community members. Our primary contributions include the finding that information sources consistently exacerbate (e.g., Facebook) or ameliorate (e.g., news from the internet) different anxieties, or can have mixed effects (e.g., radio). We also find that anxiety and information have significant impacts on refugees' expectations of compliance by others and that, whether between camps or between camps and non-camp locales, findings vary by location. Our results have implications for refugee media and infectious disease anxiety scholarship as well as for managing infectious disease response.",Information Sources and Anxiety among Refugees in Kenya during COVID-19
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically changed the routine way of life and challenged the ways in which health and dental services are provided. During the 1st lockdown, practiced in most of the countries, routine dental procedures were suspended. Even after the lockdown was eased, visiting crowded dental clinics was still considered health-threatening, especially among populations at high risk of developing a severe reaction to COVID-19. Regretfully, in most cases, temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and bruxism were not included under the definition of emergency, leaving many patients without the possibility of consulting their dentists. A literature search, performed about 10 months after the declaration of the pandemic, found only a few studies dealing with TMD and bruxism during COVID-19. Most of the studies indicate adverse effects on subjects' psycho-emotional status (stress, anxiety, depression), which in turn lead to the intensification of subjects' TMD and bruxism symptoms, and increased orofacial pain. Unlike other oral pathologies, which require manual interventions, chronic orofacial pain can be addressed, at least at its initial stage, through teledentistry and/or consultation. Remote first aid for patients suffering from orofacial pain includes various kinds of treatment, such as the self-massage of tense and painful areas, stretching, thermotherapy, drug therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which can be administered through the phone and/or the Internet. Relevant legal and ethical issues should be considered while using remote modes for the triage, diagnosis and treatment of chronic orofacial pain patients.",One year into the COVID-19 pandemic - temporomandibular disorders and bruxism: What we have learned and what we can do to improve our manner of treatment.
"OBJECTIVES: Malaria is a vector-borne disease that remains a serious public health problem due to its climatic sensitivity. Accurate prediction of malaria re-emergence is very important in taking corresponding effective measures. This study aims to investigate the impact of climatic factors on the re-emergence of malaria in mainland China. DESIGN: A modelling study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Monthly malaria cases for four Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax and other Plasmodium) and monthly climate data were collected for 31 provinces; malaria cases from 2004 to 2016 were obtained from the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention and climate parameters from China meteorological data service centre. We conducted analyses at the aggregate level, and there was no involvement of confidential information. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The long short-term memory sequence-to-sequence (LSTMSeq2Seq) deep neural network model was used to predict the re-emergence of malaria cases from 2004 to 2016, based on the influence of climatic factors. We trained and tested the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gated recurrent unit, LSTM, LSTMSeq2Seq models using monthly malaria cases and corresponding meteorological data in 31 provinces of China. Then we compared the predictive performance of models using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error evaluation measures. RESULTS: The proposed LSTMSeq2Seq model reduced the mean RMSE of the predictions by 19.05% to 33.93%, 18.4% to 33.59%, 17.6% to 26.67% and 13.28% to 21.34%, for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and other plasmodia, respectively, as compared with other candidate models. The LSTMSeq2Seq model achieved an average prediction accuracy of 87.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The LSTMSeq2Seq model significantly improved the prediction of malaria re-emergence based on the influence of climatic factors. Therefore, the LSTMSeq2Seq model can be effectively applied in the malaria re-emergence prediction.",Predicting the impact of climate change on the re-emergence of malaria cases in China using LSTMSeq2Seq deep learning model: a modelling and prediction analysis study
"Beginning in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread across Southeast Asia, causing unprecedented epidemics. Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the “second wave” of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained.",Anthropogenic factors and the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: prospects from a spatial-based model
"As of the end of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 82 million verified infections and almost 1.8 million COVID-19-related deaths worldwide,1 resulting to an unprecedented public health response around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic, together with the applied multi-level restrictive measures, has generated a unique combination of an unpredictable and stressful biomedical and socioeconomic environment (i.e., syndemic),2 introducing real-life threat, involuntary and drastic every-day life-style changes with uncertain financial and future prospects, alongside with minimized coping and stress management possibilities.3 This combination of so many different and vital stressors may lead to acute as well as long-term, direct, indirect and even transgenerational unfavourable effects on physical and mental health and functioning, which might even represent the most precarious and still unpredictable public-health-related part of the pandemic.4 Thereby, specific population groups could be at particular risk of poor health outcomes in relation to applied public health measures.4, 5 However, not every individual will experience the same level of negative impact on health and well-being during the pandemic, as several additional national, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, emotional and cognitive factors can moderate individual resilience and coping.6 Pandemic-related research should, thus, assess as many multidimensional risk and protective factors as possible in a longitudinal, large-scale and multi-national manner, enabling a profound and comprehensive understanding of the complex health and societal impact of the pandemic worldwide.7 Nevertheless, to date, most research findings are cross-sectional, report on small and non- representative samples from individual countries, or on specific population groups (e.g., health care workers, students, clinical populations) and usually assess only a very restricted set of outcomes and time-points. Thereby, only few studies assess coping strategies, medical history or detailed socioeconomic, demographic and environmental data. In addition, most studies leave behind linguistic differences, being available in one or at best two different languages. Such investigations of small outcome subsets within a narrow framework preclude a broader and clear understanding of the multifaceted pandemic impact on the general population and specific subgroups. Acknowledging these gaps in the existing literature, large- scale, collaborative research prospectively collecting and monitoring a broad range of real- time, multi-dimensional health-related, societal and behavioural outcome data from countries across the globe is currently explicitly needed. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH- FIT) envisions to fill this gap. Based on an easy-to-access webpage (www.coh-fit.com), COH- FIT is the currently largest-scale known international collaborative study of over 200 researchers around the globe, prospectively collecting the biggest set of multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary data from 150 high, middle, and low-income countries in over 30 languages and in three different age groups (adults, adolescents, children) of the general population, focusing also on relevant at-risk subgroups. Albeit being a cross-sectional anonymous survey on an individual level, it is a longitudinal study on a population level, as data are collected continuously since April 2020 and until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic. In addition to snowball recruitment, this project also collects information from nationally representative samples. Furthermore, COH-FIT is the first study of this scale investigating pandemic effects on health and functioning measures between family members, while it also specifically assesses a large list of behavioral and coping factors (e.g., screen time, social media usage, physical activity, social interaction, religious practices, etc.) on outcomes of interest. COH-FIT also monitors changes in public health restrictive measures to enhance data harmonization across nations and time, and to better investigate their impact on physical and mental health, while it also collects information on changes in healthcare systems functioning. The COH-FIT project was worldwide first initiated in Greece after the ethics committee approval of the School of Medicine of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and is officially supported by the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, European Psychiatric Association, World Association of Social Psychiatry, ECNP Network on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion, among many other national and international scientific associations. To date, COH-FIT has already collected >115,000 participations worldwide (>8,000 in Greece), but more participants are still needed, both during the second and third wave of the pandemic, as in the future, after the pandemic has ended. Currently, the COH-FIT survey actively collects the largest sample on multifactorial data on the impact of the COVD-19 pandemic on health and functioning not only in Greece, but around the globe. The elaborated design of COH-FIT and similar studies may allow a better identification of key parameters and population groups at increased risk during the pandemic, as well as potential targets for acute and long-term prevention or intervention strategies in the current as in possible future pandemics. A profound understanding of the health and societal impact of the pandemic could facilitate an optimized governmental, social and individual health preparedness during infection times8 and the bridging of individuals', societal and systemic needs and actions through multi-level guideline development with the aim to improve mental health outcomes globally.","The need for holistic, longitudinal and comparable, real-time assessment of the emotional, behavioral and societal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across nations"
"Anemia is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in both pediatric and adult patients with heart failure. This risk is increased in patients who require ventricular assist device (VAD) placement. The most common mechanism suggested for why these patients develop anemia is chronic inflammation caused by the immune system reacting to the VAD components. The inflammatory response that occurs can suppress erythropoiesis by inhibiting production of erythropoietin. Studies have demonstrated that anemic VAD patients have lower-than-expected erythropoietin levels, which leads to the consideration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in this population. Therapy with ESAs can increase hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, thereby decreasing the need for transfusions, subsequently reducing the risk of anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody development. Concerns that ESAs may increase the risk of thrombotic complications in a population already plagued with physiologic disturbances due to the VAD device remain a main barrier in routine use of these medications. The goal of this case series is to discuss a single center's experience with epoetin alfa in pediatric VAD patients at an academic children's hospital. A total of 4 patients were included with no evidence of adverse effects during a total of 120 patient-days of epoetin therapy. One patient was able to discontinue ESA therapy secondary to robust improvement in cell line counts at the time of discharge, while the other 3 patients received heart transplant prior to the discontinuation of ESA therapy. An increase in hematocrit of 1% to 5.5% was seen from epoetin initiation to discontinuation.",Epoetin alfa in Pediatric Patients With Ventricular Assist Devices: Is It Safe?
"Context: Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many athletic training programs (ATPs) moved to mandatory virtual learning environments (VLEs) as access to clinical education sites was restricted for nonessential personnel, such as athletic training students (ATSs). Objective: To describe the development of a program for delivering clinical education for all ATSs through a VLE model. Background: Athletic training programs were faced with the task of delivering clinical education for all students through a virtual learning model. Further complicating the situation was that no blueprint for a VLE existed for athletic training. Description: The ATP developed clear, definitive objectives for a 6-week VLE, but afforded each clinical site the autonomy to determine how it could best implement the objectives of the VLE based upon its individual strengths and limitations. Advantage(s): Students reported increased self-motivation, improved communication skills and self-confidence, an improved ability to adapt to new situations, increased independence, personal and professional growth, the ability to stay positive and focused in the face of unexpected challenges, increased appreciation and application of evidence-based practice, and a more in-depth understanding and confidence related to organization and administration topics. Conclusion(s): Virtual learning environments offer an alternative for accomplishing the clinical education of ATSs when they cannot be physically present because of extenuating circumstances, such as a pandemic. Additionally, the objectives and implementation strategies of the VLE can be integrated into the face-to-face clinical education plan to create an improved comprehensive approach to clinical education.",Developing a Virtual Learning Environment for Clinical Education amidst a Pandemic
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW It is accepted that several chronic diseases are associated with inflammation. Dietary habits and the consumption of certain nutrients have been shown to influence inflammation. In this narrative review, we discuss currently developed tools to assess the inflammatory potential of diets and compare them with established tools. RECENT FINDINGS Four new indices were recently developed. The Inflammatory Score of the Diet is a modified version of the established Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). The novel Empirical DII works without previous dietary intake assessment and the Anti-Inflammatory Diet Index was specifically developed in a northern European population. The Dietary and Lifestyle Inflammation Score addresses additional confounders. The informative value of dietary indices relies on the accuracy and completeness of dietary intake assessment. SUMMARY Dietary inflammatory indices are important tools to assess, compare and validate the inflammatory potential of diets across populations without the need for biomarker assessments. They allow to investigate associations between an (anti)-inflammatory diet with disease risk and course. Although the DII remains the most used index worldwide, currently developed indices allow more flexibility, have a different focus or simplify assessment. Additional foods, that were recently shown to modulate inflammation, but are not (fully) considered yet, may deserve more attention in the future.",Assessing the (anti)-inflammatory potential of diets.
"Drug repurposing may be a pivotal means of fulfilling urgent needs for treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but current studies on drug repurposing for COVID-19 seem to show a lack of consensus in their drug candidate focus. Using bibliometric methods in a non-expert perspective, in a review of 34 published articles on the COVID-19 and drug-repurposing, we investigated obvious and less obvious points of consensus on drug candidates. To establish these two types of consensus, we first implemented document clustering. Within a set of five clustered papers, we established an obvious consensus, relying solely on the occurrence of entities by using term frequency and inverse document frequency and a comparison of mentioned drugs, finding that remdesivir and chloroquine were discussed with a certain degree of agreement. For the less obvious consensus, we created a drug entity co-occurrence network to establish low-high centrality combinations to probe the crucial drugs found in article clustering that are not plainly apparent through the mere counting of the occurrence of drug entities occurrences. Lopinavir emerged as having possibly potent effects in spite of underuse, while the mainstream of studies focus more on drugs such as chloroquine that enjoy explicit consent. Using an entitymetrics perspective, we expect that our research will support investigations of drug repurposing, expediting the process of establishing treatment for COVID-19.",Are we there yet?

"Objective: To determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sociodemographic aspects, and health conditions and COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. Methods: Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM2.5 long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. Results: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having a higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality.","Air pollution, sociodemographic and health conditions effects on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia: an ecological study"
"Japanese encephalitis, caused by infection with the neurotropic flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is among the most important viral encephalitides in Asia. While previous studies established an essential role of Ab and type I IFN, it is still unclear if the cell-mediated immune responses, through their direct antiviral effector functions, contribute to protection against the fatal disease. We report here that mice defective in both the granule exocytosis and death receptor pathways of cytotoxicity display increased susceptibility to JEV. The two cell contact-dependent cytotoxic effector mechanisms act redundantly within the CNS to reduce disease severity. We also demonstrate that IFN-γ is critical in recovery from primary infection with JEV by a mechanism involving suppression of virus growth in the CNS, and that T cells are the main source of the cytokine that promotes viral clearance from the brain. Finally, we show by in vivo depletion of NK cells that this innate immune cell population is dispensable for control of JEV infection in the periphery and in the CNS. Accordingly, cell contact-dependent cytolytic and IFN-γ-dependent noncytolytic clearance of virus mediated by T cells trafficking into the CNS help in recovery from lethal infection in a mouse model of Japanese encephalitis.",Cytolytic effector pathways and IFN-γ help protect against Japanese encephalitis.

"BACKGROUND Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial consumption worldwide. OBJECTIVES To describe the impact of the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) on antimicrobial consumption pre-pandemic and to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial consumption worldwide. METHODS A cross-sectional time-series analysis using a dataset of monthly purchases of antimicrobials (antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals) from August 2014 to August 2020. Antimicrobial consumption per 1000 population was assessed pre-pandemic by economic development status using linear regression models. Interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models tested for significant changes with pandemic declaration (March 2020) and during its first stage from April to August 2020, worldwide and by country development status. RESULTS Prior to the pandemic, antimicrobial consumption decreased worldwide, with a greater apparent decrease in developed versus developing countries (-8.4%, P = 0.020 versus -1.2%, P = 0.660). Relative to 2019, antimicrobial consumption increased by 11.2%, P < 0.001 in March 2020. The greatest increase was for antivirals in both developed and developing countries (48.2%, P < 0.001; 110.0%, P < 0.001) followed by antibiotics (6.9%, P < 0.001; 5.9%, P = 0.003). From April to August 2020, antimicrobial consumption decreased worldwide by 18.7% (P < 0.001) compared with the previous year. Specifically, antibiotic consumption significantly decreased in both developed and developing countries (-28.0%, P < 0.001; -16.8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The global decrease in antimicrobial consumption pre-pandemic suggests a positive impact of the WHO GAP-AMR. During the pandemic, an initial increase in antimicrobial consumption was followed by a decrease worldwide. AMR plans should specify measures to ensure full implementation of AMR efforts during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Global consumption of antimicrobials: impact of the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

"Post COVID-19 vaccine development, nations are now getting ready to face another challenge: how to effectively distribute vaccines among the masses to quickly achieve herd immunity against the infection. According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.",Strategies for Ensuring Required Service Level for COVID-19 Herd Immunity in Indian Vaccine Supply Chain

"Since COVID-19 became a pandemic, the global economy has been dramatically affected. Not just that, the consumer behavior in the retail market has also changed. This paper aims to examine the effect of the coronavirus crisis on consumer behavior in retail services. The paper will focus on retail banking services, especially the Jordanian banking sector. The goal of the study was achieved by conducting a survey among Jordanian consumers in the retail banking sector, which was done using questionnaires, a sample of 240 retail customers from 14 valid participants. The paper brings new insight into how the pandemic affected retail banking services and proves the acceptance of online and banking in the conceptual model. The results show that the variables around attitudes toward the internet and mobile banking were directly and positively affected by the variables related to the perception of the pandemic's impact on the consumer's lifestyle. Other variables such as the safety of using online and mobile banking services and phones also contributed to this rise in a positive attitude. The Trust in Mobile and internet banking has several administrative and social implications, which were also discussed. Because new consumption behavior models are being developed, mobile and internet services could prevail even after the later stages of the epidemic. Initiatives to provide online educational programs, especially financial courses, should be intensified by the banks in Jordan to enable their customers to be familiar with the use of the banks' online banking services. They should enhance their communication with their customers and offer new products and services while also showing flexibility while negotiating to refinance and loaning terms. © 2022, Growing Science.

"In early 2020, the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented shock to the global education system, resulting in most educational institutions closing their doors and turning to various forms of remote learning to ensure continuous education for their communities Since the world has not experienced this scale of school closure before, the goal of this study was to explore what, if anything, non-state schools (NNSs) were doing to support remote learning that may help them to prepare for future events that curtail education In May 2020, Edify, an international non-governmental organization (INGO) operating in eleven nations in Latin America (LATAM), Sub-Saharan Africa and India conducted a telephone survey with a stratified random sample of 388 school leaders Since the extent learning had continued across contexts was relatively unknown, the survey aimed to inform the organization's current and future responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future educational interruptions In addition to identifying the various uses of technology and possible innovations as to how non-state schools can respond when a crisis impacts their operating status, this paper describes three areas of concern expressed by the school leaders: (1) the health and safety of children and adults in their schools;(2) the various challenges of maintaining financial sustainability;and (3) the learning loss of students from the lack of preparedness for such a massive interruption in their school's normal operations © Copyright © 2021 Cordeiro, Gluckman and Johnson","Responses to COVID-19 From Non-State School Leaders in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and, India: A Call for Educational Equity"
"The Covid-19 pandemic has upended societies, economic activity, and business environments. With a focus on the meat processing sector, this paper considers the short, medium, and potential long-term implications of the pandemic for food supply chains. A series of short-run demand and supply shocks affected the food system. The pandemic has generated a lively discourse around the adaptability and resilience of food supply chains in the medium to longer term. Scale and scope economies in meat processing offer significant cost and efficiency advantages, while a more dispersed industry structure can be more flexible. The pandemic is likely to accelerate the adoption of automation and digitalization within food supply chains. The Covid-19 pandemic also focused consumer attention on the food system and the nature of food supply chains. Consumers' underlying food values may shape their response to uncertainty during a pandemic. The pandemic offers lessons for the food industry in proactively identifying and addressing points of vulnerability within supply chains.",The Covid-19 pandemic and meat supply chains

"AIMS: Dashboards provide a visual summary of relevant data to track performance against key indicators over time. They are used in healthcare to monitor the quality of patient care and to identify potential quality improvement projects. There is little published evidence of them being used in mental health services, especially in forensic psychiatric care. This project aims to design a dashboard for use in a forensic and intensive psychiatric care unit, by specifying measures and ideal features it would include. To develop a model for a quality dashboard for use To decide which measures would be reported on the dashboard To find reliable methods of assessing said measures To explore staff preferences as to how the dashboard would display data, and how they would like the information to be disseminated To use blank data to design a mock dashboard interface for feedback METHOD: A literature search was conducted on healthcare dashboards and quality improvement projects taking place on low-secure psychiatric wards similar to the Blair unit. Potential outcome measures and methods of assessing them were researched. Staff thoughts on the dashboard, and which measures they would like to see included, were explored in interviews and using a survey RESULT: Blank data were fed into excel to create example graphs for a mock dashboard. The results section details: measures to be included, such as staff turnover rate, absences, and patient satisfaction levels; how they can be assessed; and specific features of the dashboard, such as the capability to track trends in selected quality indicators over a period of time. Further development of this project out with the 4 week development timeframe will require cooperation from IT services and unit management staff. CONCLUSION: Many staff suggestions, whilst valuable measures, were more suitable for use in a clinical or nursing dashboard, rather than a quality dashboard. COVID-19 factored into reasons why staff requested certain measures, and also meant that less staff were available to be contacted about the project. This project has limitations based on the four-week timeframe, but could be further developed by staff on the unit if desired.",Developing a dashboard for use in a forensic and intensive care psychiatric unit: a quality improvement project
"BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The prevalence of high blood pressure is steadily rising as the population grows amongst older adults with the ageing population. Therapeutical treatments are widely available to decrease blood pressures, in addition to many lifestyle options, such as dietary changes and exercise. There is a marked preference amongst patients, as reiterated by Hypertension Canada, for more research into non-therapeutic methods for controlling blood pressure or to reduce the burden of taking many pills to control high blood pressure. Indeed, effective options do exist, especially with diet, specifically decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake. Current public health outreach primarily focusses on sodium intake, even though potassium intake remains low in the Western world. Excellent data exist in published research that increasing potassium intake, either via dietary modification or supplements, reduces blood pressure and reduces risk of cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke. However, the advice most often provided by medical professionals is to ‘eat more fruits and vegetables’ which has little impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: We propose to do a clinical trial in two stages with an adaptive trial design. In the first stage, participants with high blood pressure and proven low potassium intake (measured on the basis of a 24-h urine collection) will get individually tailored dietary advice, reinforced by weekly supportive phone/email support. At 4 weeks, if there has not been a measured increase in potassium intake, participants will be prescribed an additional potassium supplement. Testing will be conducted again at 8 weeks, to confirm the efficacy of the potassium supplement. Final measurements will be planned at 52 weeks to observe and measure the persistence of the effect of diet or additional supplement. Concurrent measurements of sodium intake, blood pressure, participant satisfaction, and safety measures will also be done. DISCUSSION: The results of the study will help determine the most effective method of increasing potassium intake, thus reducing blood pressure and need for blood pressure-lowering medicines, and at the same time potentially increasing participant satisfaction. The current guidelines recommend changes in diet, not a potassium supplement, to increase potassium intake; hence, the two-stage design will only add supplements if the most rigorous dietary advice does not work.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The evidence of benefiting from a high-quality diet for knee osteoarthritis (OA) joint structures, symptoms, and systemic abnormalities is limited. Clarifying the relationship between diet quality and knee OA could provide useful information for knee OA management. To investigate the associations between diet quality and knee joint structures, symptoms, lower limb muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in people with knee OA. METHODS: This study was a post-hoc, exploratory analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial in symptomatic knee OA participants with a follow-up time of 24 months. In brief, eligible participants of the original study were aged 50-79 years, had symptomatic knee OA, and had a pain of 20-80 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale. After excluding the patients without information on diet quality, 392 participants were included in this post-hoc analysis. Diet quality was assessed at baseline using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) which includes subscores of vegetable, fruit, grain, dairy products, fat, and alcohol. Knee joint structures (including cartilage volume, cartilage defect, bone marrow lesions, and effusion-synovitis volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging), OA symptoms, lower limb muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and follow up. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations of diet quality with those outcomes. RESULTS: Diet quality mainly reflect diet variety within the core food was not associated with knee structures and OA symptoms, but was associated with greater lower limb muscle strength (ß = 0.66, P = 0.001), lower depressive symptom (ß = -0.08, P = 0.001), and better quality of life (ß = -0.06, P = 0.002). In further analyses of food group-based sub-scores, only the vegetable sub-score had the similar associations with lower limb muscle strength (ß = 1.03, P = 0.004), depressive symptom (ß = -0.17, P < 0.001), and quality of life (ß = -0.14, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality, mainly vegetable diet quality, is associated with greater lower limb muscle strength, less depressive symptoms, and higher quality of life in knee OA patients, suggesting higher diet quality may have protective effects on knee OA.","Associations between diet quality and knee joint structures, symptoms and systemic abnormalities in people with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis"
"OBJECTIVE Legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements of medical research uniformly call for informed consent. We aimed to characterize and compare consent rates for neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries versus high-income countries, and to evaluate the influence of study characteristics on consent rates. METHODS In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials of neonatal interventions in low- and lower middle-income countries or high-income countries published 01/01/2013 to 01/04/2018. Our primary outcome was consent rate, the proportion of eligible participants who consented amongst those approached, extracted from the article or email with the author. Using a generalised linear model for fractional dependent variables, we analysed the odds of consenting in low- and lower middle-income countries versus high-income countries across control types and interventions. FINDINGS We screened 3523 articles, yielding 300 eligible randomized controlled trials with consent rates available for 135 low- and lower middle-income country trials and 65 high-income country trials. Median consent rates were higher for low- and lower middle-income countries (95.6%; interquartile range (IQR) 88.2-98.9) than high-income countries (82.7%; IQR 68.6-93.0; p<0.001). In adjusted regression analysis comparing low- and lower middle-income countries to high-income countries, the odds of consent for no placebo-drug/nutrition trials was 3.67 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.87-7.19; p = 0.0002) and 6.40 (95%CI 3.32-12.34; p<0.0001) for placebo-drug/nutrition trials. CONCLUSION Neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries report consistently higher consent rates compared to high-income country trials. Our study is limited by the overrepresentation of India among randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries. This study raises serious concerns about the adequacy of protections for highly vulnerable populations recruited to clinical trials in low- and lower middle-income countries.",Informed consent rates for neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income versus high-income countries: A systematic review.
"Currently, chest X-rays, as one of the auxiliary diagnostic methods for COVID-19, play an important role in the detection of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose an automatic detection method of COVID-19 chest X-ray based on Convolution Neural Network. In this method, we first get an image of the chest by X-ray, and then we preprocess the chest X-rays, and then send the preprocessed X-ray images to the convolutional neural network for feature extraction and classification, and finally we were able to diagnose whether COVID-19 or not. We test the three types of models (Inception V3, ResNet and DenseNet) under different layers, and finally propose the automatic detection method of COVID-19 chest X-ray. After a large number of experiments, the highest accuracy rate of COVID-19 detection is 98.059%. Compared with other studies in the same period, our accuracy rate is higher, and it is very fast. This indicates that our proposed method can be used as an auxiliary detection for COVID-19.",Automatic detection of COVID-19 chest X-ray based on Convolution Neural Network
"PURPOSE: Although research on orthorexia nervosa (ON) has developed in recent years, there exists a continuous need to develop valid tools to assess ON risk, according to strict diagnostic criteria. The present study aims to conduct Polish adaptation and validation of the Authorized Bratman Orthorexia Self-Test (ABOST), through a comparison of dichotomous and continuous Likert response scales. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 472 people with mean age of 27 years (ranging between 18 and 78 years, M = 26.88, SD = 10.40). The survey included demographic questions and measures of orthorexia (the ABOST and ORTO-15), eating disorders (EAT-26), body mass index (BMI), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCI-R), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). The following statistical tests were performed to explore the psychometric properties of the ABOST: descriptive statistics, Student’s t-test, Pearson’s correlation, Cronbach’s α reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The ABOST using a five-point Likert scale for responses demonstrated good psychometric properties. The CFA goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the one-factor solution. Positive correlations were found between the ABOST and the ORTO-15, EAT-26, OCI-R, GAD-7, and PHQ-9. Women scored higher in the ABOST than men, while BMI was unrelated to the ABOST. CONCLUSION: The ABOST using the Likert scale provides a reliable and valid instrument to assess ON risk, as indicated by the face, structural, and convergent validity results. However, more research in various countries is needed, in order to verify the results of this study.",Validation and Polish Adaptation of the Authorized Bratman Orthorexia Self-Test (ABOST): Comparison of Dichotomous and Continuous Likert-Type Response Scales
"The first step in statistical inference of the evolutionary histories of species is developing a probability model that describes the mutation process as accurately and realistically as possible. A major complication of this inference is that different loci on the genome can have histories that diverge from the common species history and each other. The multispecies coalescent process is commonly used to model one source of this divergence, incomplete lineage sorting, or ILS. In Chifman and Kubatko, 2015 , the authors computed the site pattern probabilities for four taxa under a full probability model based on the Jukes-Cantor substitution model when the molecular clock holds. This paper generalizes that work to a relaxed clock model, allowing for mutation rates to differ among species. This will enable better phylogentic inference in cases where the molecular clock does not hold.",Site Pattern Probabilities Under the Multispecies Coalescent and a Relaxed Molecular Clock: Theory and Applications.
"Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances of thought, cognition, and behavior. Despite massive research efforts to date, the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. The difficulty of brain research is largely a result of complex interactions between contributory factors at different scales: susceptible gene variants (molecular scale), synaptopathies (synaptic, dendritic, and cell scales), and alterations in neuronal circuits (circuit scale), which together result in behavioral manifestations (individual scale). It is likely that each scale affects the others, from the microscale to the mesoscale to the macroscale, and vice versa. Thus, to consider the intricate complexity of schizophrenia across multiple layers, we introduce a multi-scale, hierarchical view of the nature of this disorder, focusing especially on N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The reason for placing emphasis on NMDAR is its clinical relevance to schizophrenia, as well as its diverse functions in neurons, including the robust supralinear synaptic integration provided by N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate (NMDA) spikes and the Ca2+ permeability of the NMDAR, which facilitates synaptic plasticity via various calcium-dependent proteins. Here, we review recent evidence implicating NMDARs in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from the multi-scale perspective. We also discuss recent advances from optical techniques, which provide a powerful tool for uncovering the mechanisms of NMDAR synaptic pathology and their relationships, with subsequent behavioral manifestations.",Multi-Scale Understanding of NMDA Receptor Function in Schizophrenia
"The COVID-19 crisis hit the economy hard, it is a global situation of declining activity due to a highly contagious disease which has pushed the world to the brink of a deeper recession than ever. Small and medium-sized enterprises constitute 92% of the Moroccan economic fabric, they are among the organizations most seriously affected by the current pandemic. This paper examines the problems that exist before and during this crisis, in order to raise major challenges and choose the ideal approach that will strengthen the competitiveness of these companies. the analysis is based on secondary data and the literature to demonstrate the different constraints of these companies and to show the importance of lean manufacturing as the guarantor of industrial performance. the main question is how the alignment of Lean principals goes well with the desired improvement and with the constraints posed by this crisis, the primary objective of Lean is to provide the means to succeed and accelerate competitiveness. Finally, these circumstances can be a real opportunity to assist Small and Medium Moroccan companies to integrate the methods they need, and ""Lean approach"" is one of the best performance solutions to adopt in a post COVID-19.",Covid-19 Impact on Moroccan Small and Medium-sized Enterprises: Can Lean Practices Be an Effective Solution for Getting out of Crisis?
"The response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States has resulted in rapid modifications in the delivery of health care. Key among them has been surge preparation to increase both acute care hospital availability and staffing while using state and federal waivers to provide appropriate and efficient delivery of care. As a large health system in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, we were faced with these challenges early on, including the need to rapidly transition patients from acute care beds to provide bed capacity for the acute care hospitals. Rehabilitation medicine has always played an essential role in the continuum of care, establishing functional goals while identifying patients for postacute care planning. During this crisis, this expertise and the overwhelming need to adapt and facilitate patient transitions resulted in a collaborative process to efficiently assess patients for postacute care needs. We worked closely with our skilled nursing facility, home care partners, and an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital to adapt their admissions processes to the patient population with COVID-19, all the while grappling with varying access to vital supplies, testing, and manpower. As the patient criteria were established, rapid pathways were created to postacute care, and we were able to create much needed bed capacity in our acute care hospitals.",Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postacute Care Decision Making
"Despite the formidable progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, quality assessment of NMR-derived structures remains as an important problem. Thus, validation of protein structures is essential for the spectroscopists, since it could enable them to detect structural flaws and potentially guide their efforts in further refinement. Moreover, availability of accurate and efficient validation tools would help molecular biologists and computational chemists to evaluate quality of available experimental structures and to select a protein model which is the most suitable for a given scientific problem. The (13)C(α) nuclei are ubiquitous in proteins, moreover, their shieldings are easily obtainable from NMR experiments and represent a rich source of encoded structural information that makes (13)C(α) chemical shifts an attractive candidate for use in computational methods aimed at determination and validation of protein structures. In this chapter, the basis of a novel methodology of computing, at the quantum chemical level of theory, the (13)C(α) shielding for the amino acid residues in proteins is described. We also identify and examine the main factors affecting the (13)C(α)-shielding computation. Finally, we illustrate how the information encoded in the (13)C chemical shifts can be used for a number of applications, viz., from protein structure prediction of both α-helical and β-sheet conformations, to determination of the fraction of the tautomeric forms of the imidazole ring of histidine in proteins as a function of pH or to accurate detection of structural flaws, at a residue-level, in NMR-determined protein models.",(13)C Chemical Shifts in Proteins: A Rich Source of Encoded Structural Information
"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 112M patients and resulted in almost 2.5M deaths worldwide. The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-&#945; and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-&#945; and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-&#945; levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.",Increased Serum Levels of Soluble TNF-α Receptor Is Associated With ICU Mortality in COVID-19 Patients
"Controversy around the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines may lead to low vaccination rates. Survey data were collected in April and August 2020 from a total of 2343 Australian adults. A quarter (n = 575, 24%) completed both surveys. A generalized linear mixed model analysis was conducted to determine whether willingness to vaccinate changed in the repeated sample, and a multinominal logistic regression was conducted in all participants to determine whether willingness to vaccinate was associated with demographics, chronic disease, or media use. Willingness to vaccinate slightly decreased between April (87%) and August (85%) but this was not significant. Willingness to vaccinate was lower in people with a certificate or diploma (79%) compared to those with a Bachelor degree (87%), p < 0.01 and lower in infrequent users of traditional media (78%) compared to frequent users of traditional media (89%), p < 0.001. Women were more likely to be unsure if they would be willing to vaccinate (10%) compared to men (7%), p < 0.01. There were no associations between willingness to vaccinate and age, chronic disease, or social media use. Promotion of a COVID-19 vaccine should consider targeting women, and people with a certificate or diploma, via non-traditional media channels.","As the Pandemic Progresses, How Does Willingness to Vaccinate against COVID-19 Evolve?"
"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in pediatric trauma patients. In adults, goal-directed thrombelastography (TEG) has been shown to reduce mortality when used to guide massive transfusion (MT) resuscitation. There remains a paucity of data on the utility of TEG in directing resuscitation of pediatric trauma patients. We hypothesize that abnormalities on admission TEG will differ in pediatric trauma patients who undergo MT, compared to those who do not. METHODS: Pediatric patients (≤ 18 years) who were highest level trauma activations at two trauma centers from 2015 to 2018 were analyzed. We included patients who had admission TEGs and excluded those who did not. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received MT (> 40 cc/kg total blood product within 6 h of admission) and those who did not. We defined TEG abnormalities based on each institution’s normative values and compared TEG abnormalities between the groups. RESULTS: Of 117 children included, 39 had MT. MT patients had higher injury severity scores (30 vs. 23, p = 0.0004), lactates levels (7.0 vs. 3.5, p < 0.001), base deficit levels ( − 12.2 vs. − 5.8, p < 0.001), and INR values (1.8 vs. 1.3, p < 0.001). MT patients had significantly shortened alpha-angles (35.9% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.023), maximum amplitude (MA) values (43.6% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.001), and significantly lower platelet counts (165 vs. 281, p < 0.001) compared to those who did not receive MT. There was no difference in the trends in R-time, LY30 (lysis or shutdown), or fibrinogen concentration between the groups. Logistic regression identified a decreased MA as a significant predictor for MT [OR 3.68 (CI 1.29–10.52)] CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric trauma patients who undergo MT are more likely to have lower alpha-angles and MA values, as well as lower platelet counts. These findings support the use of TEG to identify hemorrhaging pediatric trauma patients, who may benefit from cryoprecipitate and/or platelet transfusions. TEG provides real-time information on coagulation status, which may expedite the delivery of specific blood products during trauma resuscitation.

"Introduction Il n’existe que peu de données concernant la présentation, l’incidence, la sévérité et l’évolution du COVID-19 chez les patients en hémodialyse chronique. Description Une étude observationelle prospective a été réalisée dans huit centres d’hémodialyse en Alsace, France, afin d’identifier les caractéristiques cliniques des patients en hémodialyse chronique atteints du COVID-19 et d’établir les déterminants associés au risque de décès. Méthodes Tous les patients en hémodialyse chronique testés positif pour le COVID-19 entre le 5 mars et le 28 avril 2020 ont été inclus. Les données collectées incluaient les caractéristiques du patients, la cliniques au diagnostic, les résultats biologiques, le traitement et l’évolution. Résultats Parmi les 1346 patients en hémodialyse, 123 ont été testés positif pour le COVID-19. Ils étaient âgés (77 [66-83] ans), avec un nombre important de comorbidités (3,2±1,6 par patients). Les symptômes étaient jugés compatibles chez 63 % des patients. L’asthénie (77 %), la diarrhée (34 %) et l’anorexie (32 %) étaient fréquentes au diagnostic. Le délai moyen entre le début des symptômes et le diagnostic, la mort ou la guérison complète étaient respectivement de 2 [0-5], 7 [4-11] et 32 [26,5-35] jours. 23 % des patients ont bénéficié d’un traitement par lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine et/ou corticoïdes. La CRP et le compte des lymphocytes au diagnostic étaient respectivement de 55 (25-106) mg/L et 690 (450-960) Ly/μl. Le taux de létalité était de 24 % et les déterminants associés avec le risque de décès étaient la température corporelle (HR 1,96 ; 95 %CI 1,11-3,44 ; p = 0,02) et la CRP au diagnostic (HR 1,01 ; 95 %CI 1,005–1,017 ; p < 0,0001) (Fig. 1). Conclusion Les patients en hémodialyse chronique s’avèrent être à haut risque de développer le COVID-19 avec un taux de mortalité élevé. La forme initiale de la maladie est le plus souvent sévère mais la présentation clinique est fréquemment atypique.

"AIMS: Whilst a centralised model of care intuitively makes sense and is advocated in other subspecialty areas of medicine, there is a paucity of supportive evidence for General Paediatrics. Following ward restructuring at our tertiary paediatric centre in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, a new dedicated General Paediatrics ward was established. We evaluated medical and nursing staff well-being, morale and perceived impacts on care after the ward's establishment. METHODS: Experiences were sought from medical and nursing staff whom had worked across both previous wards caring for General Paediatrics patients, as well as the new dedicated General Paediatrics ward. Mandated responses used the format of much better, better, same, worse and much worse. RESULTS: A total of 73/82 (89%) medical and nursing staff completed the survey. A greater than 90% improved or neutral response was noted for 31/35 (89%) questions. About 80% of staff reported the new dedicated General Paediatrics ward provided a better or much better team-based approach, time efficient approach and overall model of care. A much better or better response was reported for communication between medical and nursing staff in 68%, team comradery in 69%, supportive/helpful nursing staff in 74%, job stress level in 66% and staff morale in 60% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Overwhelmingly positive responses from this study support a centralised or ""home"" ward model of care for General Paediatrics patients in a tertiary paediatric setting. Our findings may be relevant to General Paediatrics teams in other centres currently using multiple wards to manage their patients.","Positive impacts of a dedicated General Paediatrics ""home"" ward in a tertiary paediatric Australian hospital"
"BACKGROUND: The consequences of COVID-19 in those who recover from acute infection requiring hospitalisation have yet to be clearly defined. We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC). FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52-66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77% of predicted (IQR 67-87) at 3 months, 76% of predicted (68-90) at 6 months, and 88% of predicted (78-101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 8·61 [95% CI 2·83-26·2; p=0·0002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (1·36 [1·13-1·62]; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION: In most patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, dyspnoea scores and exercise capacity improved over time; however, in a subgroup of patients at 12 months we found evidence of persistent physiological and radiographic change. A unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 is required.

"In this work, we establish a methodological framework to analyze the care demand for elderly citizens in any area with a large proportion of elderly population, and to find connections to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Thanks to this analysis, it is possible to detect deficiencies in the public elderly care system, identify the most disadvantaged areas in this sense, and reveal convenient information to improve the system. The methods used in each step of the framework belong to data analytics: choropleth maps, clustering analysis, principal component analysis, or linear regression. We applied this methodology to Barcelona to analyze the distribution of the demand for elderly care services. Thus, we obtained a deeper understanding of how the demand for elderly care is dispersed throughout the city. Considering the characteristics that were likely to impact the demand for homecare in the neighborhoods, we clearly identified five groups of neighborhoods with different profiles and needs. Additionally, we found that the number of cases in each neighborhood was more correlated to the number of elderly people in the neighborhood than it was to the number of beds in assisted living or day care facilities in the neighborhood, despite the negative impact of COVID-19 cases on the reputation of this kind of center.",Assessing the Distribution of Elderly Requiring Care: A Case Study on the Residents in Barcelona and the Impact of COVID-19
"SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly worldwide, but the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains unknown. To understand this better, an 18-item online survey was disseminated by the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation with questions exploring SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms, mobilization, and cryopreservation strategies and COVID-19 infections in allogeneic related and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) donors. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of the outbreak on policies relating to HPC mobilization, collection, and processing with respect to changes in daily routine. A total of 91 individual responses from distinct centers in 6 continents were available for analysis. In these centers, the majority (72%) of allogeneic related and autologous donors are routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 before HPC collection, and 80% of centers implement cryopreservation of allogeneic HPC grafts before commencing conditioning regimens in patients. Five related and 14 autologous donors who tested positive for COVID-19 did not experience any unexpected adverse events or reactions during growth factor administration (eg, hyperinflammatory syndrome). These data are limited by the small number of survey respondents but nonetheless suggest that centers are following the recommendations of appropriate scientific organizations and provide some preliminary data to suggest areas of further study.",Changes in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Practices in Response to COVID-19: A Survey from the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation

"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to assess the validity and reliability of a structured questionnaire of inclusion for Paralympic dance (PD), the association between the type of athlete about the perception of inclusion in own dance studio, and to describe knowledge and perceptions of inclusion in PD participants. METHODS: Thirty-eight Italian PD participants answered a survey and a structured questionnaire of inclusion in PD (QIPD). RESULTS: The internal consistence of the QIPD was acceptable (α = 0.79) albeit one item greater than 1 was excluded, and the test–re-test reliability was moderate to excellent (ICC 0.66–1.00). Most participants with disabilities reported to approach dancesport due to friendship and involvement of dance coach, whereas most participants without disabilities thanks to dance coach (86%). Most participants with disabilities reported to practice PD for pleasure and passion, whereas participants without disabilities because they feel emotion by dancing with a partner with disabilities (83%). A relationship was observed between the type of athlete in the coach’s attempt to remove all barriers to participation (X(2) = 4.994). CONCLUSION: The QIPD is valid and reliable to assess knowledge and perceptions of inclusion in PD. PD participants with and without disability seem to perceive sport inclusion similarly, except for the removal of barriers to participate in PD courses.",Questionnaire of inclusion in Paralympic dance: validation and pilot study
"OBJECTIVE To assess serial secretory activation biomarker concentrations (sodium [Na], potassium [K], Na:K ratio, protein, lactose, citrate) in mother's own milk (MOM) from pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants to determine associations with coming to volume (CTV), defined as producing at least 500mL/day MOM by day 14 postpartum. STUDY DESIGN We collected serial MOM samples and pumped MOM volume data for 14 days postpartum in mothers who delivered at <33 weeks of gestation. Regression models and Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate associations. RESULTS Of 40 mothers, 39 (mean gestational age 28.8 weeks; 67% overweight/obese; 59% non-white) had paired MOM volume and biomarker data; 33% achieved CTV between days 6-14 postpartum. In univariate models, MOM Na on day 5 and Na:K ratios on days 3 and 5 were associated with CTV. Mothers achieving CTV were more likely to have postpartum Na:K ratios ≤1 on day 3 (75% vs. 25%, P = .06) and ≤0.8 on day 5 (69% vs 10%, p<0.01) compared with mothers not achieving CTV. In a multivariable regression model, day 5 Na:K ratio (1 unit decrease in Na:K, OR 18.7 [95% CI 1.13-311.41], p=0.049) and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (1 unit increase in BMI, OR 0.88, [95% CI 0.78-0.99], p=0.04) were associated with CTV between days 6-14. CONCLUSION Secretory activation and CTV were compromised in pump dependent mothers with preterm delivery. CTV was predicted by MOM Na and Na:K ratios. These biomarkers hold potential as objective point-of-care measures to detect potentially modifiable lactation problems in a high-risk population.",Mother's Own Milk Biomarkers Predict Coming to Volume in Pump-dependent Mothers of Preterm Infants.

Despite numerous efforts to identify the host reservoir(s), the transmission cycle of filoviruses between the animal host(s) and humans remains unclear. The last decade has witnessed an increase in filovirus outbreaks with a changing epidemiology. The high mortality rates and lack of effective antiviral drugs or preventive vaccines has propagated the fear that filoviruses may become a real pandemic threat. This article discusses the factors that could influence the possible pandemic potential of filoviruses and elaborates on the prerequisites for the containment of future outbreaks, which would help prevent the evolution of filovirus into more virulent and more transmissible viruses.",“Filoviruses”: a real pandemic threat?
"BACKGROUND: Lung-protective ventilation (LPV) improves outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through the administration of low tidal volumes (≤ 6.5 ml/kg predicted body weight [PBW]) with co-titration of positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen. Many patients with ARDS, however, are not managed with LPV. The purpose of this study was to understand the implementation barriers and facilitators to the use of LPV and a computerized LPV clinical decision support (CDS) tool in intensive care units (ICUs) in preparation for a pilot hybrid implementation-effectiveness clinical trial. METHODS: We performed an explanatory sequential mixed methods study from June 2018 to March 2019 to evaluate the variation in LPV adherence across 17 ICUs in an integrated healthcare system with > 4000 mechanically ventilated patients annually. We analyzed 47 key informant interviews of ICU physicians, respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurses in 3 of the ICUs using a qualitative content analysis paradigm to investigate site variation as defined by adherence level (low, medium, high) and to identify barriers and facilitators to LPV and LPV CDS tool use. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of patients had an initial set tidal volume of ≤ 6.5 ml/kg PBW during the measurement period (site range 21–80%). LPV CDS tool use was 28% (site range 6–91%). This study’s main findings revealed multi-factorial facilitators and barriers to use that varied by ICU site adherence level. The primary facilitator was that LPV and the LPV CDS tool could be used on all mechanically ventilated patients. Barriers included a persistent gap between clinician attitudes regarding the use of LPV and actual use, the perceived loss of autonomy associated with using a computerized protocol, the nature of physician-RT interaction in ventilation management, and the lack of clear organization measures of success. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in adherence to LPV persists in ICUs within a healthcare delivery system that was an early adopter of LPV. Potentially promising strategies to increase adherence to LPV and the LPV CDS tool for ARDS patients include initiating low tidal ventilation on all mechanically ventilated patients, establishing and measuring adherence measures, and focused education addressing the physician-RT interaction. These strategies represent a blueprint for a future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial.",Multi-factorial barriers and facilitators to high adherence to lung-protective ventilation using a computerized protocol: a mixed methods study
"Humoral immunity to the Severe Adult Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2 is not fully understood yet but is a crucial factor of immune protection. The possibility of antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) would have important implications for immune protection but also for the development of specific diagnostic ELISA tests. Using peptide microarrays, n = 24 patient samples and n = 12 control samples were screened for antibodies against the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome as well as the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), VME1 (V), R1ab, and Protein 3a (AP3A) of the HCoV strains SARS, MERS, OC43, and 229E. While widespread cross-reactivity was revealed across several immunodominant regions of S and N, IgG binding to several SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides provided statistically significant discrimination between COVID-19 patients and controls.

"In order to strengthen the construction of China's health industry and improve the health of the people, based on the data of 31 provinces and cities in China from 2009 to 2019, the improved EBM model is used to measure the health production efficiency of each region, and Moran index is used to study the Spatio-temporal variation of health production efficiency of each province. Finally, the spatial econometric model is applied to study the influencing factors of the Spatio-temporal variation of health production efficiency. The results show that generally speaking, the average efficiency of 31 provinces and cities is above 0.7, and the average efficiency of some regions is above 1. From the perspective of time variation, the average efficiency value in the eastern region and the middle region increases from 0.816 to 0.882 and from 0.851 to 0.861, respectively. However, the average efficiency value in the western region and northeast region decreases from 0.861 to 0.83 and from 0.864 to 0.805, respectively. From the perspective of spatial distribution, HH agglomeration and LL agglomeration exist in most regions. By comparing Moran scatter plots in 2009 and 2019, it is found that the quadrants of most regions remain unchanged, and LL agglomeration is the main agglomeration type in local space. There is a significant spatial dependence among different regions. From the perspective of spatial empirical results, Pgdp, Med, and Pd have a positive effect on health production efficiency. The direct effect and indirect effect of Pgdp, Med, and Gov all pass the significance test of 1%, indicating that there are spatial spillover effects of the three indicators. Each region should reasonably deal with the spillover effect of surrounding regions, vigorously develop economic activities, carry out cooperation with surrounding regions and apply demonstration effect to accelerate the development of overall health production.",Spatio-Temporal Variation of Health Production Efficiency Considering Environmental Pollution in China Based on Modified EBM and Spatial Econometric Model
"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an economically important enteropathogen of swine with worldwide distribution. PDCoV primarily infects the small intestine instead of the large intestine in vivo However, the underlying mechanism of PDCoV tropism to different intestinal segments remains poorly understood as a result of the lack of a suitable in vitro intestinal model that recapitulates the cellular diversity and complex functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we established the PDCoV infection model of crypt-derived enteroids from different intestinal segments. Enteroids were susceptible to PDCoV and multiple types of different functional intestinal epithelia were infected by PDCoV in vitro and in vivo We further found that PDCoV favorably infected the jejunum and ileum, and restrictedly replicated in the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, enteroids from different intestinal regions displayed a distinct gene expression profile, and the differential expression of primary viral receptor host aminopeptidase N (APN) instead of the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different intestinal segments to PDCoV although PDCoV substantially elicited antiviral genes production in enteroids after infection. Additional studies showed that PDCoV infection significantly induced the expression of type I and III IFNs at the late stage of infection, and exogenous IFN inhibited PDCoV replication in enteroids. Hence, our results provide critical inputs to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The zoonotic potential of the PDCoV, a coronavirus efficiently infecting cells from broad species including porcine, chicken and human, emphasizes the urgent need to further study the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV in its natural host. Herein, we generated crypt stem cell-derived enteroids from porcine different intestinal regions, which well recapitulated the events in vivo of PDCoV infection that PDCoV targeted multiple types of intestinal epithelia and preferably infected the jejunum and ileum compared with the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the expression of APN receptor rather than the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different regions of the intestines to PDCoV infection though PDCoV infection markedly elicited the IFN responses. Our findings provide important insights into how the distinct gene expression profiles of the intestinal segments determine the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV.",APN Expression not IFN Responses Determines the Intestinal Segmental Tropism of Porcine Deltacoronavirus.
"OBJECTIVE Hypertension has become the leading cause of death worldwide. Data on hypertension management among Shenzhen elderly are sparse. Our study aims to investigate treated and controlled hypertension in Shenzhen elderly, and identify relevant predictors. DESIGN A cross-sectional study. SETTING Communities in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study was conducted. We employed a convenience sampling method to select participants; 124 007 participants aged 65 years and older were recruited from January to December 2018 at local community health centres in Shenzhen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Data on treatment, control and influencing factors of hypertension were obtained from a standard questionnaire, physical measurements and biochemical analyses. RESULTS Prevalence of hypertension was 55.8% among the sample population. Among this group of hypertensive patients, those undergoing hypertension treatment and those with hypertension under control were 54.4% and 32.3%, respectively. Employing multivariate analysis, significant associations were found between treatment and older age, junior high school education and above (OR=1.25, p＜0.05), being widowed rather than being married or cohabiting (OR=1.28, p＜0.05), engaging in physical activity (OR=1.14, p＜0.05), ex-smoker (OR=1.19, p＜0.05), habitual drinker (OR=0.72, p＜0.05), history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR=2.20, p＜0.05) and comorbidities, with a higher probability for those with obesity (OR=1.89, p＜0.05), central obesity (OR=1.10, p＜0.05), diabetes (OR=1.49, p＜0.05) or dyslipidaemia (OR=1.20, p＜0.05). Male sex (OR=0.91, p＜0.05), junior high school education and above (OR=1.28, p＜0.05), engaging in physical activity (OR=1.06, p＜0.05), history of CVD (OR=1.82, p＜0.05) and individuals who had diabetes (OR=1.52, p＜0.05) or dyslipidaemia (OR=1.05, p＜0.05) were associated with increased likelihood of control. Aged 80 years and older (OR=0.93, p＜0.05), habitual drinker (OR=0.73, p＜0.05) and central obesity (OR=0.94, p＜0.05) were negatively associated with control of hypertension.

"BACKGROUND Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. A number of minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced as a treatment to prevent glaucoma progressing. Among them, endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) is a cyclodestructive procedure developed by Martin Uram in 1992. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ECP in people with open angle glaucoma (OAG) and primary angle closure whose condition is inadequately controlled with drops. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 12 July 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECP compared to other surgical treatments (other minimally invasive glaucoma device techniques, trabeculectomy), laser treatment or medical treatment. We also planned to include trials where these devices were combined with phacoemulsification compared to phacoemulsification alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors planned to independently extract data from reports of included studies using a data collection form and analyse data based on methods expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was proportion of participants who were drop-free (not using eye drops). Secondary outcomes included mean change in IOP; proportion of participants who achieved an IOP of 21 mmHg or less, 17 mmHg or less or 14 mmHg or less; and proportion of participants experiencing intra- and postoperative complications, We planned to measure all outcomes in the short-term (six to 18 months), medium-term (18 to 36 months), and long-term (36 months onwards). MAIN RESULTS We found one ongoing study that met our inclusion criteria (ChiCTR-TRC-14004233). The study compares combined phacoemulsification with ECP to phacoemulsification alone in people with primary angle closure glaucoma. The primary outcome is intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of IOP-lowering drugs. A total of 50 people have been enrolled. The study started in February 2014 and the trialists have completed recruitment and are in the process of collecting data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently no high-quality evidence for the effects of ECP for OAG and primary angle closure. Properly designed RCTs are needed to assess the medium and long-term efficacy and safety of this technique.",Endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) for open angle glaucoma and primary angle closure.
"Viruses utilize cellular lipids and manipulate host lipid metabolism to ensure their replication and spread. Therefore, the identification of lipids and metabolic pathways that are suitable targets for antiviral development is crucial. Using a library of compounds targeting host lipid metabolic factors and testing them for their ability to block pseudorabies virus (PRV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, we found that U18666A, a specific inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), is highly potent in suppressing the entry of diverse viruses including pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPC1 deficiency markedly attenuates viral growth by decreasing cholesterol abundance in the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which are indispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Significantly, exogenous cholesterol can complement the dynamics of CCPs, leading to efficient viral entry and infectivity. Administration of U18666A improves the survival and pathology of PRV- and influenza A virus-infected mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which NPC1 inhibition achieves broad antiviral activity, indicating a potential new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other emerging viruses.",NPC1-regulated dynamic of clathrin-coated pits is essential for viral entry
"The focus of this article is community supported agriculture (CSA) as an alternative food movement and a bottom-up response to the problems of the dominant food systems. By utilizing social innovation approach that explores the relationship between causes for human needs and emergence of socially innovative food initiatives, the article examines how the CSA projects emerge and why, what is their innovative role as part of the social economy and what is their transformative potential. Based on qualitative data from four different models of CSA case studies in different regions of Wales, UK, and by using concepts from an alternative model for social innovation (ALMOLIN) as analytical tool, the article demonstrates that the Welsh CSA cases play distinctive roles as part of the social economy. They satisfy the needs for ecologically sound and ethically produced food, grown within communities of like-minded people and they empower individuals and communities at micro level, while at the same time experiment with how to be economically sustainable and resilient on a small scale. The paper argues that in order to become ‘workable utopias’, the CSA initiatives need to overcome the barriers that prevent them from replicating, participating in policies and decision-making at macro level, and scaling up.",‘Workable utopias’ for social change through inclusion and empowerment?

"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 led lockdown, a reliable system to monitor ureteral stent insertion and timely removal became an important facet of their use. This study looks at the use of ‘Urostentz’ smartphone application (app) for stent procedures and whether it improved patient communication and safety during the lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The ‘Urostentz’ app was used for patients who underwent ureteric stent after ureteroscopy (URS) or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedure. It is a smartphone app developed to improve patient safety, facilitate data collection, and provide an efficient interface to simplify ureteral stent tracking and patient communication. It also helps clinicians track stent-related symptoms (SRS) and provide digital remote assistance. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients registered with a mean age of 47.8 years (range:18–80) and a male: female ratio of 4.5:1. Of these, 29 (87.9%) used the Urostentz app, and 55.2% had SRS. The number of effective communication episodes ranged from 1–7/patient. Based on the symptoms and communication, stent was removed during lockdown (n = 2), within 1 week of lockdown lifted (n = 24) and within 2 weeks of lockdown lifted (n = 5). None of the patients suffered any stent-related complications and there were no cases of forgotten stents or readmissions despite the lockdown and lack of communication using standard practices. CONCLUSIONS: The Urostentz app proved to an effective medium of communication to provide guidance and personalized digital remote healthcare. It also allowed prompt removal of stents avoiding prolonged stent symptoms or forgotten stents. Such apps can have a much wider application in the post-COVID-19-era to reduce unnecessary post-procedural visits and reduce health care costs.",Use of ureteric stent related mobile phone application (UROSTENTZ App) in COVID-19 for improving patient communication and safety: a prospective pilot study from a university hospital
"The first wave of COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of all of us in some way There was an assumption that at the time of the pandemic, there were lower numbers of hospitalized patients, not only with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, because of people‘s fear of getting infected with COVID-19 virus in hospital facilities Moreover, there was a concern about the negative impact of the regimen measures on the diagnostics and treatment of patients with ischemic stroke We carried out a retrospective analysis of 191 patients admitted to our department with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke in a 3-month period of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic from March to May 2020 and in a 3-month period from March to May 2019 The number of ischemic stroke patients hospitalized at Regional Hospital Liberec during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (3–5/2020) was slightly higher than during a comparable time a year ago (3–5/2019) Regarding the observed times of therapeutic procedures and the clinical outcome of patients with ischemic stroke, there were minimal, statistically non-significant, differences The first wave of COVID-19 pandemic affected neither the numbers of patients with ischemic stroke nor their diagnostics and therapy at Regional Hospital Liberec © 2021, Czech Medical Association J E Purkyne All rights reserved","Influence of the first wave of covid-19 pandemic on numbers of admitted ischemic stroke patients, on their diagnostics and therapy"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, China has dispersed rapidly worldwide. Although most patients present with mild fever, cough with varying pulmonary shadows, a significant portion still develops severe respiratory dysfunction. And these severe cases are often associated with manifestations outside the respiratory tract. Currently, it is not difficult to find inflammatory cytokines upregulated in the blood of infected patients. However, some complications in addition to respiratory system with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are impossible to explain or cannot be attributed to virus itself. Thus excessive cytokines and their potentially fatal adverse effects are probably the answer to the multiple organ dysfunctions and growing mortality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying cytokine storm, summarizes its pathophysiology and improves understanding of cytokine storm associated with coronavirus infections by comparing SARS-CoV-2 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",An enlightening role for cytokine storm in coronavirus infection
"BACKGROUND Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness. It affects the quality of life of patients and has been associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study aimed to determine the prevalence of fibromyalgia in HIV-positive patients and assess the effect of fibromyalgia on their functional status. METHODOLOGY This was a cross-sectional study comprising 160 treatment-naive HIV-positive patients and 160 age- and sex-matched HIV-negative controls. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was based on the 2011 modification of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria by assessing the widespread pain index and symptom severity score. The severity of fibromyalgia was assessed with the revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire. RESULTS The prevalence of fibromyalgia in HIV-positive individuals was found to be 10.6%, which was significantly higher compared with controls (3.1%; P = .008). There was no significant association between fibromyalgia and age, gender, or occupation. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count levels (P < .001), WHO clinical stage (P < .001), and fibromyalgia. A statistically significant higher score on the Revised FM Impact Questionnaire was found in HIV-positive individuals with fibromyalgia (P < .001). CONCLUSION The study found that HIV-positive patients had a significantly higher incidence of fibromyalgia than controls and this was related to active indices of HIV disease. Fibromyalgia had a greater clinical impact on HIV patients than in controls. As a result, fibromyalgia should be identified and treated in people living with HIV.",Fibromyalgia in HIV-positive patients in Nigeria: A cross-sectional prospective study.

"Introdução A pandemia trouxe inúmeros desafios aos serviços de saúde e isso não foi diferente nos serviços de hemoterapia. O novo cenário exigiu constantes modificações nas rotinas de trabalho de acordo com o que se descobria a respeito da doença e seus impactos na transfusão de sangue. Novas estratégias de captação de doadores, manejo ainda mais criterioso dos estoques de hemocomponentes e adequação da infraestrutura às medidas sanitárias são alguns exemplos das adaptações que ocorreram. Concomitantemente ocorreu uma importante alteração do perfil de pacientes atendidos nos hospitais em geral com redução significativa de pacientes cirúrgicos e elevação do número de atendimentos clínicos, em especial em ambientes de terapia intensiva. Objetivo Avaliar o volume de transfusões por tipo de hemocomponente antes e depois do início do cenário de pandemia de COVID-19 em uma instituição privada da região sul da cidade de São Paulo. Métodos Foi realizado estudo descritivo e comparativo através de análise de dados obtidos no sistema informatizado de gerenciamento da agência transfusional. Foram incluídos os dados referentes às transfusões que ocorreram no período abril/2019 a março/2021 classificando-as de acordo com o tipo de hemocomponente diferenciando-se entre componentes eritrocitários, componentes plaquetários e componentes plasmáticos (plasma e crioprecipitado). Resultados Nos 12 meses que antecederam o início da pandemia foram realizadas 5.613 transfusões, sendo 2.553 concentrados de hemácias (45%), 1.407 concentrados de plaquetas (25%), 1.453 plasmas frescos congelados (26%) e 200 crioprecipitados (4%). Já no período de abril/2020 a março/2021, foram realizadas 6.091 transfusões, sendo 2.599 concentrados de hemácias (43%), 2.614 concentrados de plaquetas (43%), 598 plasmas frescos congelados (10%) e 280 crioprecipitado (4%). Observou-se que no período houve um crescimento do número total de transfusões de 8% em relação ao período pré pandemia, além de uma alteração do perfil de consumo dos hemocomponentes, com expressivo crescimento absoluto e relativo do número de transfusões de componentes plaquetários (25% versus 43%). Conclusões A pandemia alterou significativamente o perfil de paciente atendido nos hospitais de todo o mundo e isso não foi diferente no hospital estudado. Os pacientes com quadros graves de COVID-19 apresentavam frequentemente quadros de insuficiência respiratória hipoxêmica com necessidade de circulação extracorpórea com membrana de oxigenação (ECMO) além distúrbios de coagulação o que resultou no aumento do consumo de concentrados de plaquetas.",ANÁLISE DO PERFIL EPIDEMIOLOGICO TRANSFUSIONAL DE HEMOCOMPONENTES ANTES E DEPOIS DO INÍCIO DA PANDEMIA DE COVID-19 EM UM HOSPITAL TERCIÁRIO DE GRANDE PORTE NA CIDADE DE SÃO PAULO

"BACKGROUND: The initial period of COVID-19-related restrictions affected substance use in some population groups. We explored how changes in alcohol use at the beginning of the pandemic impacted the health and wellbeing of people with and without mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions (MHDCs). METHODS: Data came from the Global Drug Survey Special Edition on COVID-19 conducted in May-June 2020. Measured were; changes in drinking compared to February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 restrictions), reasons for changes, and impact on physical health, mental health, relationships, finances, work/study, and enjoyment. This study included 38,141 respondents (median age = 32 IQR 25-45; 51.9% cis man; 47.8% cis woman; 1.2% trans/non-binary; 30.2% with MHDCs e.g. depression 20.0%, anxiety 16.3%, ADHD 3.8%, PTSD 3.3%). RESULTS: A third (35.3%) of respondents with MHDCs and 17.8% without MHDCs indicated that increased drinking affected their mental health negatively (p<.001); 44.2% of respondents with MHDCS compared to 32.6% without MHDCs said it affected their physical health negatively (p<.001). Reduced drinking was associated with better mental health among a fifth (21.1%) of respondents with MHDCS and 14.4% without MHDCs (p<.001). Age, relationship status, living arrangements, employment, coping and distress were significant predictors of increases in drinking. CONCLUSION: Among people with MHDCS, reduced alcohol consumption was associated with better mental health, while the negative effects of increased drinking were more pronounced when compared to people without MHDCS. When supporting people in reducing alcohol consumption during uncertain times, people with MHDCS may need additional support, alongside those experiencing greater levels of distress.",Impacts of changes in alcohol consumption patterns during the first 2020 COVID-19 restrictions for people with and without mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions: A cross sectional study in 13 countries
"BACKGROUND Osteotomy of the lesser tuberosity in shoulder arthroplasty allows bony healing of the subscapularis tendon but does not prevent fatty degeneration in its muscle. Occurrence or increase in fatty degeneration may depend on the surgical technique. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We (1) assessed fatty degeneration in the subscapularis muscle and its cross-sectional area after a C-block osteotomy of the lesser tuberosity with minimal mobilization of the subscapularis muscle, and (2) determined whether this technique had any adverse effect on function, fatty degeneration, and cross-sectional area of the subscapularis muscle. METHODS We retrospectively examined 36 patients with shoulder replacements who had C-block osteotomies. Constant-Murley scores and clinical signs of subscapularis insufficiency were recorded. We radiographically assessed prosthetic placement. On CT scans, lesser tuberosity healing, fatty degeneration, and cross-sectional area of the subscapularis muscle were determined. The minimum followup was 13 months (mean, 18 months; range, 13-33 months). RESULTS The mean absolute Constant-Murley score was 71.2. Two patients had weakness of the subscapularis muscle without loss of active motion. All tuberosities healed anatomically. A normal glenohumeral relationship was found in all cases. Fatty degeneration was Grade 0 in 44%, Grade 1 in 39%, Grade 2 in 14%, and Grade 3 in 3%. The subscapularis muscular cross-sectional area decreased from 16.7 cm(2) preoperatively to 14.5 cm(2) postoperatively (13%). CONCLUSIONS The C-block osteotomy with minimal dissection of the subscapularis is associated with a low incidence of fatty degeneration in the subscapularis muscle after shoulder arthroplasty although the muscular cross-sectional area of the subscapularis decreased. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",Subscapularis release in shoulder replacement determines structural muscular changes.
"A new insect nidovirus (named Yichang virus) from the family Mesoniviridae was isolated, identified, and characterized from Culex mosquitoes in Hubei, China. Results showed a high number of viral RNA copies (up to 10(11) copies/ml) within 48 h in C6/36 cells. In addition, the titers of the Yichang virus reached maximal levels of 10(7) PFU/mL at 6 d post-infection (dpi). The virus produced moderate cytopathic effects when the multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.001–0.1 at 6 dpi, but did not replicate in mammalian cells. Under electron microscopy, the virion of the Yichang virus appeared as spherical particles with diameters of ∼80 nm and large club-shaped projections. Although subsequent genomic sequence analysis revealed that the Yichang virus had similar protein patterns as those of other mesoniviruses, the nucleotide acids shared less than 20% BLAST query coverage with known viruses in the family Mesoniviridae, and showed a maximum sequence identity of 67% for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The putative protein sequences showed slightly higher identity (28%–68%), and the most conserved domain was RdRp. Based on the phylogenetic and pairwise evolutionary distance analyses, the Yichang virus should be considered a new species belonging to a currently unassigned genus within the family Mesoniviridae.",Isolation and characterization of a novel mesonivirus from Culex mosquitoes in China
"BACKGROUND: The population of uncontrolled asthma patients represents a large therapeutic burden. The PDE3-inhibitor enoximone is a strong and quick bronchodilator and is known to successfully treat life-threatening bronchial asthma (status asthmaticus). Translational mice models showed anti-inflammatory effects when PDE3 was targeted. METHODS: Here, we investigated the effectiveness of PDE3-inhibitor enoximone as oral treatment for chronic asthma in a real-life off-label setting. Investigational use of PDE3-inhibitor enoximone: 51 outpatients (age 18–77) with chronic asthma were followed using off-label personalized low doses of the PDE3-inhibitor enoximone. Duration of treatment was 2–8 years. RESULTS: Four groups could be distinguished as follows: The first group includes patients who use enoximone as an add-on, because it helps them in maintaining a better general wellbeing; they still use their traditional medication (n = 5). The second group consists of patients who use enoximone and were able to phase down their traditional medication without deterioration of their asthma symptoms (n = 11). The third group comprises patients who were able to discontinue their traditional medication and use only enoximone without deterioration of their asthma symptoms (n = 24). The last one has patients who, after having used enoximone for some time, saw their symptoms disappear and now use no medication at all, not even enoximone (n = 11). All patients reported improvement or at least alleviation of their asthma symptoms. All patients reported a better quality of life and greater drug compliance. CONCLUSION: The evaluation shows that PDE3-inhibitor enoximone is a viable alternative for or addition to current asthma therapeutics, as both add-on and stand-alone, considerably reducing the use of LABAs/SABAs/ICS, with no or negligible side effects. Additional studies are advisable.","Evaluation of Real-Life Investigational Use of Enoximone in Asthma, the Third Step in Drug Repurposing: A Preliminary Report"
"The exponential growth of greenhouse gas emissions and their associated climate change problems have motivated the development of strategies to reduce CO(2) levels via CO(2) capture and conversion. Reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction has been targeted as a promising pathway to convert CO(2) into syngas which is the primary reactive in several reactions to obtain high-value chemicals. Among the different catalysts reported for RWGS, the nickel-based catalyst has been proposed as an alternative to the expensive noble metal catalyst. However, Ni-based catalysts tend to be less active in RWGS reaction conditions due to preference to CO(2) methanation reaction and to the sintering and coke formation. Due to this, the aim of this work is to study the effect of the potassium (K) in Ni/CeO(2) catalyst seeking the optimal catalyst for low-temperature RWGS reaction. We synthesised Ni-based catalyst with different amounts of K:Ni ratio (0.5:10, 1:10, and 2:10) and fully characterised using different physicochemical techniques where was observed the modification on the surface characteristics as a function of the amount of K. Furthermore, it was observed an improvement in the CO selectivity at a lower temperature as a result of the K-Ni-support interactions but also a decrease on the CO(2) conversion. The 1K catalyst presented the best compromise between CO(2) conversion, suppression of CO(2) methanation and enhancing CO selectivity. Finally, the experimental results were contrasted with the trends obtained from the thermodynamics process modelling observing that the result follows in good agreement with the modelling trends giving evidence of the promising behaviour of the designed catalysts in CO(2) high-scale units.",K-Promoted Ni-Based Catalysts for Gas-Phase CO(2) Conversion: Catalysts Design and Process Modelling Validation
"Objective To improve the selection of patients with acute ischaemic stroke for intra-arterial treatment using a clinical decision tool to predict individual treatment benefit.Design Multivariable regression modelling with data from two randomised controlled clinical trials.Setting 16 hospitals in the Netherlands (derivation cohort) and 58 hospitals in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe (validation cohort).Participants 500 patients from the Multicenter Randomised Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in the Netherlands trial (derivation cohort) and 260 patients with intracranial occlusion from the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial (validation cohort).Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days after stroke. We constructed an ordinal logistic regression model to predict outcome and treatment benefit, defined as the difference between the predicted probability of good functional outcome (mRS score 0-2) with and without intra-arterial treatment.Results 11 baseline clinical and radiological characteristics were included in the model. The externally validated C statistic was 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.73) for the ordinal model and 0.73 (0.67 to 0.79) for the prediction of good functional outcome, indicating moderate discriminative ability. The mean predicted treatment benefit varied between patients in the combined derivation and validation cohort from -2.3% to 24.3%. There was benefit of intra-arterial treatment predicted for some individual patients from groups in which no treatment effect was found in previous subgroup analyses, such as those with no or poor collaterals.Conclusion The proposed clinical decision tool combines multiple baseline clinical and radiological characteristics and shows large variations in treatment benefit between patients.

"BACKGROUND: Training future clinicians in safe opioid prescribing (SOP) and treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical to address the opioid epidemic. The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education requires all programs to provide instruction and experience in pain management and will mandate addiction medicine clinical experiences for internal medicine trainees. OBJECTIVE: Assess residents’ training in SOP and treatment of OUD and identify training barriers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional nationally representative survey was emailed in 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred twenty-two Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine members in US internal medicine residency programs. MAIN MEASURES: Program opportunities and challenges to developing or implementing training in SOP, treatment of OUD, and buprenorphine waiver training, and perceived curricular effectiveness. KEY RESULTS: The response rate was 69.4% (293/422). Most programs required didactics in SOP (94.2%) and treatment of OUD (71.7%). Few programs required clinical experiences including addiction medicine clinics (28/240, 11.7%), inpatient consult services (11/240, 4.6%), or offsite treatment rotations (8/240, 3.3%). Lack of trained faculty limited developing or implementing curricula (61.5%). Few respondents reported that their program was “very effective” in teaching SOP (80/285, 28.1%) or treatment of OUD (43/282, 15.3%). Some programs offered buprenorphine waiver training to residents (83/286, 29.0%) and faculty (94/286, 32.9%) with few mandating training (11.7% (28/240) and 5.4% (13/240) respectively). Only 60 of 19,466 (0.3%) residents completed buprenorphine waiver training. Primary care programs/tracks were more likely to offer waiver training to residents (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; 95% CI, 1.68–5.60; P < 0.001) and faculty (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–3.22; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative survey, few internal medicine residency programs provided clinical training in SOP and treatment of OUD, and training was not viewed as very effective. Lack of effective training may have adverse implications for patients, clinicians, and society.

"The vast majority of commercially available inactivated influenza vaccines are produced from egg-grown or cell-grown live influenza virus. The first step in the production process is virus inactivation with β-propiolactone (BPL) or formaldehyde (FA). Recommendations for production of inactivated vaccines merely define the maximal concentration for both reagents, leaving the optimization of the process to the manufacturers. We assessed the effect of inactivation with BPL and FA on 5 different influenza virus strains. The properties of the viral formulation, such as successful inactivation, preservation of hemagglutinin (HA) binding ability, fusion capacity and the potential to stimulate a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) reporter cell line were then assessed and compared to the properties of the untreated virus. Inactivation with BPL resulted in undetectable infectivity levels, while FA-treated virus retained very low infectious titers. Hemagglutination and fusion ability were highly affected by those treatments that conferred higher inactivation, with BPL-treated virus binding and fusing at a lower degree compared to FA-inactivated samples. On the other hand, BPL-inactivated virus induced higher levels of activation of TLR7 than FA-inactivated virus. The alterations caused by BPL or FA treatments were virus strain dependent. This data shows that the inactivation procedures should be tailored on the virus strain, and that many other elements beside the concentration of the inactivating agent, such as incubation time and temperature, buffer and virus concentration, have to be defined to achieve a functional product.",Inactivated or damaged?

"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has already reached pandemic proportions in a matter of a few weeks. At the time of writing this manuscript, the unprecedented public health crisis caused more than 2.5 million cases with a mortality range of 5-7%. The SARS-CoV-2, also called novel Coronavirus, is related to both SARS-CoV and bat SARS. Great efforts have been spent to control the pandemic that has become a significant burden on the health systems in a short time. Since the emergence of the crisis, a great number of researchers started to use the AI tools to identify drugs, diagnosing using CT scan images, scanning body temperature, and classifying the severity of the disease. The emergence of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a challenging problem with expected serious consequences on the management of the disease. Here, we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning-based software that is enabled to classify the different genomes of Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier was trained on 1925 genomes, belonging to the three families of SARS retrieved from NCBI Database to propose a new method to train deep learning model trained on genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family name from the genome of by predicting the statistically similar genome from training data to the given genome.

"AIM The use of standard CO2 for insufflation during laparoscopic colorectal surgery may be associated with cooling and drying of the peritoneal cavity contributing to perioperative hypothermia. The aim was the assess the feasibility of a study comparing insufflation of warmed, humidified CO2 (WHCO2) (using HumiGard, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) with standard measures and its impact on the quality of recovery of surgical patients. METHODS Single-centre, triple-blind, feasibility, randomised controlled trial of adults scheduled for planned laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The primary outcome was recruitment. Secondary outcomes included feasibility of blinding, acceptability to patients, and suitability of objective measures: patient-reported quality of recovery using a validated questionnaire (QoR-40), patient pain scores, and semi-continuous core temperature measurements. RESULTS Thirty-nine participants were randomised to either WHCO2 group (n=19) or standard care alone (n=20). Recruitment to the study was successful and acceptable to patients. Blinding of the surgeons, patients, and assessors was effective. Response rates to QoR-40 were high, but ceiling effects were observed indicating the tool was unsuitable in this population. Less patients in the WHCO2 group reported post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) at days 1 (53%vs 65%) and 3 (37%vs 60%). Median hospital length of stay was 5.5 days in the standard care group and 4 days in the WHCO2 group. CONCLUSIONS A study of WHCO2 for insufflation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is highly acceptable to both patients and researchers. Potential reductions in PONV and hospital length of stay in patients treated with WHCO2 merits further investigation. The design of the full-scale RCT will benefit from this feasibility study.","Warmed and humidified insufflation to prevent perioperative hypothermia and improve quality of recovery in elective laparoscopic colorectal resection patients: A feasibility, triple blind randomised controlled trial."
"BACKGROUND: Health care professionals in endoscopic labs have an elevated risk for COVID-19 infection, therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of current pandemic on the workflow and infection prevention and control strategies of endoscopy units in real-life setting. METHODS: All members of Hungarian Society of Gastroenterology were invited between 7 and 17 April 2020 to participate in this cross-section survey study and to complete an online, anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Total of 120 endoscopists from 83 institutes were enrolled of which 35.83% worked in regions with high cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Only 33.33% of them had undergone training about infection prevention in their workplace. 95.83% of endoscopists regularly used risk stratification of patients for infection prior endoscopy. While indications of examinations in low risk patients varied widely, in high-risk or positive patients endoscopy was limited to gastrointestinal bleeding (95.00%), removal of foreign body from esophagus (87.50%), management of obstructive jaundice (72.50%) and biliary pancreatitis (67.50%). Appropriate amount of personal protective equipment was available in 60.85% of endoscopy units. In high-risk or positive patients, surgical mask, filtering facepiece mask, protective eyewear and two pairs of gloves were applied in 30.83%, 76.67%, 90.00% and 87.50% of cases, respectively. Personal protective equipment fully complied with European guideline only in 67.50% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Survey found large variability in indications of endoscopy and relative weak compliance to national and international practical recommendations in terms of protective equipment. This could be improved by adequate training about infection prevention.",Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on workflows and infection prevention strategies of endoscopy units in Hungary: a cross-sectional survey
"Introduction: In this paper, we describe our experience and early outcomes with critically unwell severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We present our standard practices around ECMO decision-making, retrieval, cannulation, ventilation, anticoagulation, tracheostomy, imaging and steroids. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital notes on all SARS-CoV-2 patients who required extracorporeal support at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. In total, this included 18 patients over this time period. Results: In total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%). The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1 ± 3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3 ± 2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7 ± 9.4 days. Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6 ± 9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6 ± 15.3 days. Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2 ± 25.8 days. Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%). On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA. Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients. Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2-0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage. Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients. Conclusion: In our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this. There was a significant burden of thromboembolic disease and renal injury. A significant proportion of patients required tracheostomy and steroids to facilitate weaning.",SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO: early results and experience
The Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is transmitted through droplets and aerosol from the respiratory tract of an infected person;and fomites from infected linen and surface. On August 1 2020 in Yogyakarta there were 741 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 and it is still possible to increase. In the time of understanding COVID-19 there are many cases with atypical presentation including gastrointestinal symptoms. Objective: To describe a COVID-19 case without respiratory symptoms and the role of radiology in detecting COVID-19. Case Description: A 55-year-old male patient came to the hospital complaining of nausea and loss of appetite. Based on the results of the physical examination there was flatulence. Initial investigations revealed a non-reactive SARS CoV 2 IgG and IgM result. Further non-contrast MSCT Thorax showed infiltrates with bilateral subpleural posterolateral consolidation particularly the left showing typical pneumonia. Multiple blebs were also found denoting bronchiectasis. Confirmatory RT-PCR result was positive for SARS CoV 2. Conclusion: COVID-19 usually presents with common respiratory symptoms. However some patients also experience gastrointestinal symptoms that initially were not detected as COVID-19. In time of COVID-19 pandemic persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in high-risk patients warrant further chest imaging and RT-PCR of SARS CoV-2 to detect or exclude the possibility of COVID-19 diagnosis.,Chest imaging for early diagnosis of COVID-19 on a patient without respiratory symptoms: A case report
"Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is the type member of the genus Comovirus, which comprises one of three genera of the family Comoviridae. The genome of CPMV consists of two molecules of positive-strand RNA, which are separately encapsidated in isometric particles consisting of 60 copies each of two types of coat protein. Since its initial isolation, CPMV has been extensively studied from both a genetic and structural point of view and has become a paradigm for plant viruses that express their genome through the synthesis and processing of precursor polyproteins. In this regard, as well as in its particle structure, CPMV resembles other members of the family Picornaviridae. More recently, the virus has been used for a number of biotechnological applications.",Cowpea Mosaic Virus

"Learning the differential statistical dependency network between two contexts is essential for many real-life applications, mostly in the high dimensional low sample regime. In this paper, we propose a novel differential network estimator that allows integrating various sources of knowledge beyond data samples. The proposed estimator is scalable to a large number of variables and achieves a sharp asymptotic convergence rate. Empirical experiments on extensive simulated data and four real-world applications (one on neuroimaging and three from functional genomics) show that our approach achieves improved differential network estimation and provides better supports to downstream tasks like classification. Our results highlight significant benefits of integrating group, spatial and anatomic knowledge during differential genetic network identification and brain connectome change discovery.",Beyond Data Samples: Aligning Differential Networks Estimation with Scientific Knowledge
"According to recent statistics, 96 million apparent dengue infections were estimated worldwide in 2010. This figure is by far greater than the WHO prediction which indicates the rapid spread of this disease posing a growing threat to the economy and a major challenge to clinicians and health care services across the globe particularly in the affected areas. This article aims at bringing to light the current epidemiological and clinical status of the dengue fever. The relationship between genetic mutations, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the pathophysiology of disease progression will be put into perspective. It will also highlight the recent advances in dengue vaccine development. Thus far, a significant progress has been made in unraveling the risk factors and understanding the molecular pathogenesis associated with the disease. However, further insights in molecular features of the disease and the development of animal models will enormously help improving the therapeutic interventions and potentially contribute to finding new preventive measures for population at risk.",Tackling dengue fever: Current status and challenges
"In this paper, the theory of "" Fear injury kidney "" in traditional Chinese medicine is systematically reviewed, and it is found that long-term or excessive psychological changes of fear are likely to damage kidney qi and kidney essence. On this basis, the psychological studies of patients, medical staff and the public during the COVID-19 epidemic in China were analyzed, and fear psychology was found to be prevalent among all kinds of people. Modern researches on “Fear injury kidney"" have also found that long-term or excessive fear could cause changes in the neuro-endocrine-immune system, which can induce diseases or susceptibility to some diseases. Therefore, during or after the prevalence of COVID-19, different groups of people may have emotional reactions such as stress and fear, which should be paid long-term attention, and the influence of fear on the body cannot be ignored. According to the change rule of psychological state under stress reaction, we should actively respond to and take psychological crisis intervention measures in time to reduce the harm of psychological stress to the body.",Analysis of the influence of the psychology changes of fear induced by the COVID-19 epidemic on the body
"Following on from the devastating spread of COVID‐19, a major global priority has been the production, procurement, and distribution of effective vaccines to ensure that the global pandemic reaches an end. However, concerns were raised about worrying side effects, particularly the occurrence of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after administration of the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID‐19 vaccine, in a phenomenon being termed vaccine‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Similar to heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), this condition has been associated with the development of anti‐platelet factor 4 antibodies, purportedly leading to neutrophil‐platelet aggregate formation. Although thrombosis has also been a common association with COVID‐19, the precise molecular mechanisms governing its occurrence are yet to be established. Recently, increasing evidence highlights the NLRP3 (NOD‐like, leucine‐rich repeat domains, and pyrin domain‐containing protein) inflammasome complex along with IL‐1β and effete neutrophils producing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through NETosis. Herein, we propose and discuss that perhaps the incidence of VITT may be due to inflammatory reactions mediated via IL‐1β/NLRP3 inflammasome activation and consequent overproduction of NETs, where similar autoimmune mechanisms are observed in HIT. We also discuss avenues by which such modalities could be treated to prevent the occurrence of adverse events and ensure vaccine rollouts remain safe and on target to end the current pandemic.",Scientific premise for the involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in vaccine‐induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)
"Encephalitis is one of the rare complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be missed and confused with other causes of encephalitis. There was a 36-year-old male known to have glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, who was brought to the emergency department with fever and confusion of one-week duration. Altered mental status work-up, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, was done and turned out to be nondiagnostic. Multiple prolonged video-electroencephalographic recordings were done and showed different abnormalities suggestive of encephalitis. The diagnosis of COVID-19-induced encephalitis was made by exclusion of other encephalitis-related etiologies in the presence of a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and treatment was initiated accordingly. Over a period of three weeks, the patient showed progressive improvement and was discharged home with regular follow-up in the neurology clinic. Upon follow-up in the clinic, the patient was fully independent but with multiple abnormal electroencephalographic recordings showing generalized encephalopathy with no epileptic discharges.",COVID-19-Induced Encephalitis: A Case Report of a Rare Presentation With a Prolonged Electroencephalogram
"BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease, providing rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) as a treatment for COVID-19. Clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.METHODSPotential convalescent plasma donors with virologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for serum IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and against nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.RESULTSAmong 250 consecutive persons, including 27 (11%) requiring hospitalization, who were studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 97% were seropositive on 1 or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers &#8805;1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titers included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. nAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range 77-120) apart (P < 0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.CONCLUSIONnAb titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels declined, and a small proportion of convalescent individuals lacked adaptive immune responses.FUNDINGThe project was supported by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research with support from the NIAID under contract number 75N91019D00024, and was supported by the Fred Hutchinson Joel Meyers Endowment, Fast-Grants, a New Investigator award from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, and NIH contracts 75N93019C0063, 75N91019D00024, and HHSN272201800013C, and NIH grants T32-AI118690, T32-AI007044, K08-AI119142, and K23-AI140918.","Clinical, laboratory, and temporal predictors of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor candidates"

"Abstract COVID-19 outbreak has been dogged the whole world and besides economic damage; this new virus has been collapsing health units worldwide. Many people have been infected and died every day and so far, there are no vaccines or drugs approved to fight off COVID-19. In this sense, many countries have adopted strategies to avoid virus spread during the quarantine. Social isolation has caused psychological impacts and changes in people's routine, thus physical exercise emerges as an alternative to decrease cognitive problems developed by people during the quarantine. The use of technology to guide people during physical education classes has become a great strategy for people who cannot leave their homes. Besides, technology can insert people in an immersive environment increasing their interaction, merriment, improving their immune and cardiovascular systems.

"BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces that trainees and faculty of an academic eye clinic came into contact with during daily life at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis involved collection of at least two samples by teams on four different days (November 9, 2020 – December 18, 2020) using sterile swabs (Puritan HydraFlock, Garden Grove, CA). Collection sites were grouped into four zones depending on proximity and amount of time personnel spent there. Samples were transported to the laboratory in transport medium and RNA was extracted using the QIAamp DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Presence of viral RNA was investigated using the Luna Universal Probe One-step RT–qPCR kit (New England Biolabs, Ipwsich, MA). RESULTS: 834 samples were submitted. Two were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The first was a sample from a patient bathroom sink handle in the main emergency department. The second was a nasal swab sample from a staff member who had been assigned to collect samples. Prior to this positive result, this asymptomatic staff member had tested positive for COVID-19, had quarantined for two weeks, and had received a negative test. CONCLUSION: Though COVID-19 is currently widespread in the United States, this study shows that health care personnel working in New York City at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center have a low chance of encountering viral RNA on surfaces they are in close contact with during daily life.",Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces in New York City
"BACKGROUND Spinal aneurysms are rare among spinal arteriovenous malformations (SAVMs). There are few reports of endovascular management of spinal aneurysms associated with SAVM. OBJECTIVE To present endovascular management of aneurysms associated with SAVM. METHODS Of 91 patients with SAVMs,eight (9%) presented with aneurysms. Of these, three were male and five were female with a median age of 18 years (range 11-38). We evaluated the presenting pattern, lesion level, type of the target aneurysm related to the presenting pattern and AVM nidus, and the result obtained after embolization or open surgery. Clinical status was evaluated by Aminoff-Logue (ALS) gait and micturition scale scores. RESULTS The presenting patterns were subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, n=3) or mass effect caused by extrinsic (n=4) or intrinsic (n=1) cord compression. Aneurysms were located in four cervical, two thoracic, and two lumbar enlargement areas. There were two prenidal (arterial), three nidal, and three postnidal (venous) aneurysms. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 9 mm (range 3-27). Glue embolization (n=6), open surgery (n=1), and combined surgery and embolization (n=1) was performed to obliterate the aneurysms. Obliteration of the target aneurysms resulted in improvement of symptoms and clinical stabilization of SAVMs in all patients during a mean of 55 months (range 7-228) of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Identification of a symptomatic aneurysm should be associated with clinical presentation pattern. Targeted obliteration of the aneurysm by embolization and/or surgery resulted in improvement of symptoms and stabilization of SAVM.",Endovascular management of aneurysms associated with spinal arteriovenous malformations.
"BACKGROUND: Mental health issues have continued to rise globally, including among university students. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the previously existing and concerning problem. Given that coping mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the relationship between stressors and mental health, the aim of our cross-sectional study was to investigate the mediation of coping mechanisms on the relationship between the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. METHODS: University students (≥18 years old; N = 676; 31% male, 69% female) were administered an anonymous survey addressing current demographics, COVID-19 pandemic-related demographics, personal experiences, sources of stress and perceived effect on mental health, politics, sources of news/information, and various pre-validated scales addressing mental health (DASS-21), the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (IES-R) and coping strategies utilized (Brief COPE). RESULTS: Our results indicate a substantial proportion of our sample reporting scores in the severe and extremely severe DASS-21 categories, in addition to ~50% reporting a perceived deterioration in mental health relative to pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, a substantial proportion of students reported IES-R scores at levels where PTSD is of clinical concern. Alarmingly, a significant proportion of females (~15%) reported scores reflecting potential long-term PTSD-related implications. Females tended to be more severely impacted in all mental health measures. Mediation analysis indicated that while dysfunctional coping mediated the relationship between the impact of the event (COVID-19 pandemic) and all three mental health outcomes, overall, this was not the case with the positive coping strategies. CONCLUSION: Our study appears to indicate a reduced buffering influence on negative mental health outcomes by the positive coping mechanisms investigated in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and secondary interventions implemented. While the findings of this study pertain specifically to university students, they corroborate the existing extensive body of research (from physiological to behavioral, preclinical to clinical) pertaining to the response associated with major stressful events at every level of society. In this regard, the findings imply the necessity for health and other authorities, tasked with safeguarding public well-being, to avoid reactive interventions that do not appropriately balance the risks and benefits, potentially exacerbating pre-existing psychopathologies and compromising social order.",The Impact of COVID-19 and Associated Interventions on Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Sample of University Students

"BACKGROUND: Considering the role of higher blood urea nitrogen and lower serum albumin (SA) levels in deceased coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients, an increased blood urea nitrogen to SA (B/A) ratio may help to determine those at higher risk of critical illness. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of the B/A ratio with severity and 30‐day mortality in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: A total of 433 adult patients with COVID‐19 were enrolled. The laboratory markers were measured on admission. Disease severity was categorized into mild disease, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and septic shock. The mortality was followed for 30 days after admission. χ (2) test, Fisher's exact test, and Mann–Whitney U test were performed, as appropriate. Also, logistic regression and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the B/A ratio are included. RESULTS: Thirty‐day mortality rate was 27.25%. The frequency of mild, severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis, and septic shock was 30.72%, 36.95%, 24.02%, 6.00%, and 2.31%, respectively. B/A ratio and SA levels were statistically different between alive and deceased patients. The mean B/A ratio was different among classified disease severities, except for mild disease. Logistic regression revealed the B/A ratio as an independent risk factor for sepsis after adjusting for age and sex. ROC analysis showed B/A ratio had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.733 for mortality at the cutpoint of 4.944. AUC for sepsis was 0.617 which was greater than other disease severities. CONCLUSION: The results showed that B/A ratio and SA levels are associated with mortality of COVID‐19 patients. A higher B/A ratio is, additionally, associated with COVID‐19 severity, except in mild cases and it can act as an independent risk factor in sepsis. However, a greater B/A ratio is not a significant predictor of COVID‐19 severity, but it can predict mortality. Therefore, we suggest this marker for clinical assessment of patients with severe COVID‐19.",The role of blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio in the prediction of severity and 30‐day mortality in patients with COVID‐19
"BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of COVID-19, health care workers in the radiology department frequently interact with suspected patients and face a higher risk of infection and sudden surges in workload. High anxiety levels seriously harm physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is critical to determine anxiety levels of health care workers and explore its risk factors. MATERIAL/METHODS: Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the anxiety and resilience of 364 health care workers with high exposure risk from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze factors related to anxiety. RESULTS: The mean anxiety score was 44.28±8.93 and 23.4% of our study participants reported mild (n=63), moderate (n=19), or severe (n=3) anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, job position, availability of protective materials, signs of suspected symptoms, and susceptibility to emotions and behaviors of people around them were identified as risk factors for anxiety, whereas psychological resilience was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anxiety level of health care workers in the radiology department with a high exposure risk to COVID-19 was high in the early stage of the outbreak, although the majority remained within normal limits. Timely assessment and effective intervention measures can improve the mental health of these at-risk populations.",Factors Influencing Anxiety of Health Care Workers in the Radiology Department with High Exposure Risk to COVID-19

"Aminopeptidase (APN) was found to degrade interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) and inactivate its chemotactic activity. The chemotactic activity of IL‐8 was decreased by APN or neutrophil plasma membranes dose‐ and time‐dependently. The chemotactic activity was not inactivated in the presence of bestatin or WM15 monoclonal antibody. The expression of IL‐8 was measured by flow cytometry. On lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, IL‐8 expression increased for 60 min and then decreased markedly. In contrast, on treatment with LPS and bestatin, the expression of IL‐8 increased continuously for at least 120 min. These results suggest that the expression and release of IL‐8 from phagocytic cells are regulated by the proteolytic effect of APN on IL‐8. J. Leukoc.

"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.",Activatable Carbocyanine Dimers for Photoacoustic and Fluorescent Detection of Protease Activity

"Introduction: Patients (pts) with primary refractory or relapsed high-grade lymphoma (HGL) including Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 (double-hit lymphoma, DHL) have a dismal prognosis with patients almost never achieving a meaningful remission to second line therapy. No standard second line therapeutic approach exists, particularly for BL. The characteristic hallmark of these diseases is a dysregulated MYC oncogene with both downstream effects on proliferation and a high metabolic fluxes which use tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates as biosynthetic precursors. CPI-613 (devimistat) is a non-redox active analogue of lipoic acid, a required cofactor for two key mitochondrial enzymes of the TCA cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Disruption of mitochondrial function by CPI-613 results in a shutdown of ATP and biosynthetic-intermediate production, leading to cancer cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. In the initial phase I trial (n=26) one patient with multiply refractory BL had a partial remission sustained for over one year and then consolidated by surgical resection. She remains alive 7 years later. As of July 2021, 20 clinical studies for various cancers have been conducted (ongoing/completed) with devimistat with over 700 patients having received study drug. We initiated a phase II trial to further explore efficacy in HGL. Devimistat has FDA orphan status for BL and 4 other cancers. Methods: NCT03793140 is a multicenter study aiming to enroll 17 patients on each of two cohorts, BL and DHL, with a Simon's 2-stage design for each cohort, requiring one response among the first 9 treated patients to expand to 17. Patients must have had at least one prior line of therapy or are refusing standard of care and must be more than 3 months after a prior stem cell transplant. Active central nervous system (CNS) parenchymal disease is excluded, but prior leptomeningeal disease is allowed if the CSF is negative for more than 4 weeks at enrollment and maintenance intrathecal therapy is ongoing. Devimistat is given by central line over 2 hours daily x 5 days for two 14-day cycles and then as maintenance x5 days every 21 days. Pts were evaluable for response if they received at least 4 infusions over 5 days of the first cycle. Results: 9 pts were enrolled in the DHL/THL arm. Mediannumber of prior therapies were 3 (range, 1-6). No responses were seen, with only 1 patient achieving stable disease as best response, resulting in cohort closure. Thus far, 8 BL pts were enrolled. Median number of prior therapies was 3 (range, 2-4). Two patients were inevaluable for response. 1/6 patients had stable disease through cycle 7 and one had a complete response (CR). This CR patient (HIV+) with 4 prior therapies entered the study with only a biopsy proven thigh mass. He was not a transplant candidate for social reasons. He had a near complete metabolic remission after 4 cycles of devimistat and a CR after cycle 7. (Table and Figure) As of July 2021, he is in cycle 11, having had a 4-week treatment delay of cycle 5 due to CoVID 19 infection. ECOG improved from 3 to 0. Adverse events (AE): As of July30, 2021, no patient experienced a serious adverse event related to study drug. Four patients had grade 3 events at least possibly related: 2 neutropenia, 1 thrombocytopenia and 1 elevated bilirubin. 1 patient had a dose reduction for grade 2 alanine aminotransferase increase. Conclusions: Although our results are preliminary, the complete remission in this patient is promising in a disease where no viable treatment options exist in the relapsed, refractory BL. Enrollment to the BL cohort is ongoing. [Formula presented] Disclosures: Nikolaenko: Pfizer: Research Funding;Rafael Pharmaceuticals: Research Funding.

"In recent years, the development of tourism in the world showed a favorable evolution, both in tourist arrivals, as well as in income, employment, and diversification of the hotel offerings, among other indicators. In the case of Chile, 2019 became the scene of a social outbreak, the effects of which on tourism caused a sharp reduction in the number of international tourist arrivals and generated an overall sense of insecurity for internal travelers. In this context, the authorities and entrepreneurs in the tourism sector were preparing to take on the challenge. Their idea was to promote an intense advertising campaign aimed at recovering demand. The objective of this article is to analyze the scenario facing the tourism sector in Chile based on the situation generated by the coronavirus and to identify some key challenges that the sector will have to face to overcome it by taking into account the factors that triggered the social conflict in the first place. To analyze the evolution of the Chilean situation, firstly, a descriptive methodology is applied to clearly identify the evolution of the situation during the first months of 2020 in Chile. Secondly, the epa (Events Protest Analysis) method is applied to analyze press publications. Regarding the visible impact of the pandemic, there is a 99,7% drop in tourist arrivals compared to August 2019 and a 45,2% drop in the employment of accommodation and food service personnel (Deputy Secretary of Tourism, 2020). Likewise, collective protest actions, unprecedented in the country, were observed in which negative attitudes toward visiting tourists were displayed by the local communities in towns that had registered few cases of coronavirus. This situation presents a complex challenge for tourist destinations and will require new research efforts in the tourism sector to generate knowledge and planning instruments that help to face the increasingly frequent crises.",Effects of the Coronavirus on the Tourism Sector in Chile
"The current COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the need for the development of new vaccines and drugs to combat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recently, various drugs have been proposed as potentially effective against COVID-19, such as remdesivir, infliximab and imatinib. Natural plants have been used as an alternative source of drugs for thousands of years, and some of them are effective for the treatment of various viral diseases. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthracene-9,10-dione) is a biologically active anthraquinone with antiviral activity that is found in various plants. We studied the selectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on an emodin core (halogenation, nitration and sulfonation), which resulted in a library of emodin derivatives. The main aim of this work was to carry out an initial evaluation of the potential to improve the activity of emodin against human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and also to generate a set of initial SAR guidelines. We have prepared emodin derivatives which displayed significant anti-HCoV-NL63 activity. We observed that halogenation of emodin can improve its antiviral activity. The most active compound in this study was the iodinated emodin analogue E_3I, whose anti-HCoV-NL63 activity was comparable to that of remdesivir. Evaluation of the emodin analogues also revealed some unwanted toxicity to Vero cells. Since new synthetic routes are now available that allow modification of the emodin structure, it is reasonable to expect that analogues with significantly improved anti-HCoV-NL63 activity and lowered toxicity may thus be generated.",Antiviral Activities of Halogenated Emodin Derivatives against Human Coronavirus NL63
"Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathophysiology and outcomes is still limited. To learn more about COVID-19 pathophysiology we performed secondary analyses of transcriptomic data from two in vitro (Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells) and one in vivo (Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found 1467 conserved differentially expressed host genes (differentially expressed in at least two of the three model system transcriptomes compared) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To find potential genetic factors associated with COVID-19, we analyzed these conserved differentially expressed genes using known human genotype-phenotype associations. Genome-wide association study enrichment analysis showed evidence of enrichment for GWA loci associated with platelet functions, blood pressure, body mass index, respiratory functions, and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, among others. Since human protein complexes are known to be directly related to viral infection, we combined and analyzed the conserved transcriptomic signature with SARS-CoV-2-host protein-protein interaction data and found more than 150 gene clusters. Of these, 29 clusters (with 5 or more genes in each cluster) had at least one gene encoding protein that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These clusters were enriched for different cell types in lung including epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell types suggesting their pathophysiological relevancy to COVID-19. Finally, pathway analysis on the conserved differentially expressed genes and gene clusters showed alterations in several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.",Secondary analysis of transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection models to characterize COVID-19
"INTRODUCTION The research programme Safeguarding the Brains of our smallest Children (SafeBoosC) aims to test the benefits and harms of cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) oximetry in infants born before 28 weeks of gestation. In a phase II trial, infants will be randomised to visible cerebral NIRS oximetry with pre-specified treatment guidelines compared to standard care with blinded NIRS-monitoring. The primary outcome is duration multiplied with the extent outside the normal range of regional tissue oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (rStO2) of 55 to 85% in percentage hours (burden). This study was a pilot of the Visible -Oximetry Group. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an observational study including ten infants. RESULTS The median gestational age was 26 weeks+three days, and the median start-up time was 133 minutes after delivery. The median recording time was 69.7 hours, mean rStO2 was 64.2±4.5%, median burden of hyper- and hypoxia was 30.3% hours (range 2.8-112.3). Clinical staff responded to an out of range value 29 times--only once to values above 85%. In comparison, there were 83 periods of more than ten minutes with an rStO2 below 55% and four episodes with an rStO2 above 85%. These periods accounted for 72% of the total hypoxia burden. A total of 18 of the 29 interventions were adjustments of FiO2 which in 13 of the 18 times resulted in an out-of-range SpO2. Two infants suffered second-degree burns from the sensor. Five infants died. In all cases, this was unrelated to NIRS monitoring and treatment. CONCLUSION The intervention of early cerebral NIRS monitoring proved feasible, but prolonged periods of hypoxia went untreated. Thus, a revision of the treatment guideline and an alarm system is required. FUNDING The Elsass Foundation funded the present study.

"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated adoption of scarce resource allocation (SRA) policies, we sought to rapidly deploy a novel survey to ascertain community values and preferences for SRA, and to test the utility of a brief intervention to improve knowledge of and values alignment with a new SRA policy. Given social distancing and precipitous evolution of the pandemic, Internet enabled recruitment was deemed the best method to engage a community-based sample. We quantify the efficiency and acceptability of this Internet-based recruitment for engaging a trial cohort and describe the approach used for implementing a health-related trial entirely online using off-the-shelf tools. Methods: We recruited 1,971 adult participants (â‰¥18 years) via engagement with community partners and organizations and outreach through direct and social media messaging. We quantified response rate and participant characteristics of our sample, examine sample representativeness, and evaluate potential non-response bias. Results: Recruitment was similarly derived from direct referral from partner organizations and broader social media based outreach, with extremely low study entry from organic (non-invited) search activity. Of social media platforms, Facebook was the highest yield recruitment source. Bot activity was present but minimal and identifiable through meta-data and engagement behavior. Recruited participants differed from broader populations in terms of sex, ethnicity, and education, but had similar prevalence of chronic conditions. Retention was satisfactory, with entrance into the first follow-up survey for 61% of those invited. Conclusions: We demonstrate that rapid recruitment into a longitudinal intervention trial via social media is feasible, efficient, and acceptable. Recruitment in conjunction with community partners representing target populations, and with outreach across multiple platforms, is recommended to optimize sample size and diversity. Trial implementation, engagement tracking, engagement and retention are feasible with off-the-shelf tools using preexisting platforms.

"In this article, the authors develop an econometric model to determine the impact of professional telework activities on the degree of employees' performance, based on the ability to adapt to the new labor system. The data were collected using a questionnaire addressed to employees of companies that provide financial consultancy in Romania and were analyzed using the statistical software Smart-Pls 3.3.2. Starting with the literature of profile, the paper identifies the drivers of the organizational performance model in carrying out professional activities in the remote working system. These indicators are independent variables that model the impact of telework activities on business performance. The results of the study confirm the hypotheses presented in the article, emphasizing that the performance indicator of employees working in the remote system is the direct and intrinsic result of the collaboration of several factors, such as personal psychological, economic, and professional needs, system variables and regulation, while the ability to adapt to telework has a moderator effect between independent variables and the organizational performance. Identifying the determinants that contribute to increasing organizational performance through professional activities in telework is relevant for the human resource management, to value the positive aspects, such as the ability to actively involve employees, rewarded for their work and to prevent their resilience to change. © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish a set of disability weights (DWs) for COVID-19 symptoms, evaluate the disease burden of inpatients and analyse the characteristics and influencing factors of the disease. DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: The medical records generated in three temporary military hospitals in Wuhan. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 2702 inpatients generated from 5 February to 5 April 2020 were randomly selected for this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: DWs of COVID-19 symptoms were determined by the person trade-off approach. The inpatients' medical records were analysed and used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The mean DALY was evaluated across sex and age groups. The relationship between DALY and age, sex, body mass index, length of hospital stay, symptom duration before admission and native place was determined by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: For the DALY of each inpatient, severe expiratory dyspnoea, mild cough and sore throat had the highest (0.399) and lowest (0.004) weights, respectively. The average synthetic DALY and daily DALY were 2.29±1.33 and 0.18±0.15 days, respectively. Fever and fatigue contributed the most DALY at 31.36%, whereas nausea and vomiting and anxiety and depression contributed the least at 7.05%. There were significant differences between sex and age groups in both synthetic and daily DALY. Age, body mass index, length of hospital stay and symptom duration before admission were strongly related to both synthetic and daily DALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although the disease burden was higher among women than men, their daily disease burdens were similar. The disease burden in the younger population was higher than that in the older population. Treatment at the hospitals relieved the disease burden efficiently, while a delay in hospitalisation worsened it.",Disease burden from COVID-19 symptoms among inpatients at the temporary military hospitals in Wuhan: a retrospective multicentre cross-sectional study
"UNLABELLED In the worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, cluster of cases occurred in a number of large high-rise residential building blocks, especially in Hong Kong. In this study, we examined one of the most likely virus-spread mechanisms, which is related to the inter-flat or inter-zonal airflow through open-windows caused by buoyancy effects. Dual tracer gases of CO2 and SF6 are employed simultaneously to quantify the amount of the exhaust air coming out of the upper part of the window of a floor that re-enters the lower part of the open-window at the immediate upper floor. It was found that the room air could contain up to 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor, and this occurs at low wind conditions with a combination of indoor-outdoor temperature difference. The results can well explain the earlier governmental finding that DNA strings of SARS Corono-Virus were detected within the sampled deposits on the window sills of the upper floors of the two index patients' flats. The preliminary and yet alarming conclusion may be that, in high-rise buildings, windows flush with a flat façade can be a major route for the vertical spread of pathogen-containing aerosols. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The confirmation of the transmission route can have a number of implications to both building design and infectious disease control. With respect to the former, considerations should be given to minimize the inter-flat airflow via windows flush with façade for high-rise buildings with natural ventilation; and with respect to the latter, more targeted and earlier intervention can be implemented in case of any highly infectious disease outbreaks.",On-site quantification of re-entry ratio of ventilation exhausts in multi-family residential buildings and implications.

"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely serious infection with an extremely high death rate worldwide. In March, the disease was declared a ”global pandemic” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until now, there is no known vaccine or drug, since the unknown things related to the disease are more important than our theoretical and empirical knowledge. However, mathematical modeling and the estimation of the basic number of reproductions can provide clarifications in order to determine the potential and severity of this epidemic and therefore provide essential information to identify the type of measures and interventions to be taken to control the intensity of the spread of the disease. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new deterministic compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, the epidemiological state of the individuals and the intervention for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, there recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to the considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease if the number of reproduction R0was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic's differential equations. It should be mentioned that, the error between the considered model and the official data curve is quite small.",Novel Corona virus disease infection in Tunisia: Mathematical model and the impact of the quarantine strategy
"This position paper explores possible repercussions of the Corona Virus (COVID-19) response for Indigenous Australians in higher education Focusing on Western Australian universities’ swift migration to online learning, halfway through a teaching semester, we identify risks at the intersection between educational and digital inequities, illustrated by author experiences working in an Indigenous Education Unit Considering our observations of Indigenous students’ recent experiences, we argue that the pre-existing digital divide in Australia creates challenges for Indigenous university students, in addition to those faced by all university students coping with the transition to online learning in a context of social isolation These include experiences of 1) cultural isolation, brought about by being – both physically and digitally – cut off from extended family, community, and Country and 2) digital isolation, brought about by inequitable access to the full range of digital infrastructure required for effective online learning We argue that these intersecting layers of isolation highlight persistent inequities in Australian society and create new challenges for Indigenous university students We appeal to universities to acknowledge and ameliorate culturally specific forms of isolation for Indigenous students, triggered through the complex combination of COVID-19 anxiety, the digital divide and educational minority status Without this, we worry that the COVID-19 pandemic could reverse the global trend towards increasing Indigenous participation in university education and set-back efforts to Indigenise the university sector",Beyond the Social: Cumulative implications of COVID-19 for First Nations university students in Australia

"We study how moral suasion that appeals to two major ethical theories, Consequentialism and Deontology, affects individual intentions to contribute to a public good. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplary case where there is a large gap between private and social costs and where moral suasion has been widely used as a policy instrument. Based on a survey experiment with a representative sample of around 3500 Germans at the beginning of the pandemic, we study how moral appeals affect contributions with low and high opportunity costs, hand washing and social distancing, to reduce the infection externality as well as the support for governmental regulation. We find that Deontological moral suasion, appealing to individual moral duty, is effective in increasing planned social distancing and hand-washing, while a Consequentialist appeal only increases planned hand-washing. Both appeals increase support for governmental regulation. Exploring heterogeneous treatment effects reveals that younger respondents are more susceptible to Deontological appeals. Our results highlight the potential of moral appeals to induce intended private contributions to a public good or the reduction of externalities, which can help to overcome collective action problems for a range of environmental issues.",Moral Suasion and the Private Provision of Public Goods: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic

CTD-mediated binding of Rel to stalled ribosomes boosts (p)ppGpp synthesis. However, how the opposing activities of the NTD are controlled in the absence of stress was poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate on the RSH-type protein Rel that the critical regulative elements reside within the TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT) subdomain of the CTD, which associates to and represses the synthetase to concomitantly allow for activation of the hydrolase. Furthermore, we show that Rel forms homodimers, which appear to control the interaction with deacylated-tRNA, but not the enzymatic activity of Rel. Collectively, our study provides a detailed molecular view into the mechanism of stringent response repression in the absence of stress.",Structural Basis for Regulation of the Opposing (p)ppGpp Synthetase and Hydrolase within the Stringent Response Orchestrator Rel.
"OBJECTIVE: To explore healthcare provider’s perspectives and experiences of the barriers and facilitators to treat and manage COVID-19 cases. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at a private tertiary care teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Study data were analysed manually using the conventional content analysis technique. PARTICIPANTS: Key-informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with senior management and hospital leadership and in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with front-line healthcare providers. RESULTS: A total of 31 interviews (KIIs=19; IDIs=12) were conducted, between April and May 2020. Three overarching themes emerged. The first was ‘challenges faced by front-line healthcare providers working in COVID-19 wards. Healthcare workers experienced increased anxiety due to the fear of acquiring infection and transmitting it to their family members. They felt overwhelmed due to the exhaustive donning and doffing process, intense work and stigmatisation. The second theme was ‘enablers supporting healthcare providers to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic’. Front liners pointed out several enabling factors that supported hospital staff including a safe hospital environment, adequate training, a strong system of information sharing and supportive management. The third theme was ‘recommendations to support the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 crisis’. Healthcare workers recommended measures to mitigate current challenges including providing risk allowance to front-line healthcare providers, preparing a backup health workforce, and establishing a platform to address the mental health needs of the healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: This study provides an initial evidence base of healthcare providers’ experiences of managing patients with COVID-19 in the early stage of the pandemic and highlights measures needed to address the encountered challenges. It offers lessons for hospitals in low-income and middle-income countries to ensure a safe working environment for front-line workers in their fight against COVID-19.","Perceptions and experiences of healthcare providers during COVID-19 pandemic in Karachi, Pakistan: an exploratory qualitative study"
"The aim of this systematic review was to identify the challenges imposed on medical and surgical education by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the proposed innovations enabling the continuation of medical student and resident training. A systematic review on the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed on April 18th, 2020, and yielded 1288 articles. Sixty-one of the included manuscripts were synthesized in a qualitative description focused on two major axes, ""challenges"" and ""innovative solutions"", and two minor axes, ""mental health"" and ""medical students in the frontlines"". Shortage of personal protective equipment, suspension of clinical clerkships and observerships and reduction in elective surgical cases unavoidably affect medical and surgical education. Interesting solutions involving the use of virtual learning, videoconferencing, social media and telemedicine could effectively tackle the sudden cease in medical education. Furthermore, trainee's mental health should be safeguarded, and medical students can be involved in the COVID-19 clinical treatment if needed.",Medical and Surgical Education Challenges and Innovations in the COVID-19 Era: A Systematic Review
"O surto do novo coronavírus (COVID-19) em Wuhan, China, iniciado em dezembro de 2019, evoluiu para se tornar uma pandemia global. A pandemia, juntamente com o óbvio impacto relacionado à saúde, também representa uma séria ameaça ao bem-estar psicológico dos indivíduos e resultou em mudanças comportamentais significativas. O principal objetivo deste artigo foi descrever a resposta psicocomportamental a esta crise entre a população da região central da cidade de São Paulo, compreendendo os bairros da Bela Vista, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Consolação, Liberdade, República, Sé e Santa Cecília, no mês de abril de 2020. Um questionário estruturado e autoaplicável foi construído, com base em pesquisas precedentes avaliando o impacto psicológico e as mudanças comportamentais referentes ao novo cenário de Pandemia na cidade de São Paulo. Os questionários foram disponibilizados on-line e foram endereçados a qualquer indivíduo residente nos bairros selecionados, durante abril de 2020. Os dados foram analisados usando o Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) versão 21.0 para identificar possíveis riscos fatores para mudanças psicológicas e comportamentais. Foram estudados dados de 400 participantes residentes na região metropolitana de São Paulo. A disseminação do novo vírus resultou no desenvolvimento subsequente de medos na população-alvo estudada, com a maioria dos entrevistados se sentindo ansiosa diariamente (62,5%). Os participantes temiam ir aos mercados (88,8%), preocupavam-se com a saúde de seus familiares (94,5%) e sentiam-se pouco confiantes com as medidas atuais de controle de infecção (71%). Níveis de medo significativamente elevados foram observados entre pessoas com mais de 35 anos de idade. Eles eram mais propensos a temer pela segurança de sua saúde, mesmo em casa (p = 0,06). Enquanto isso, o aumento dos níveis de ansiedade devido ao uso de mídias sociais entre pessoas com menos de 35 anos resultou em comportamentos de fuga (p = 0,04). Houve maior tendência para os graduados temerem pela segurança de sua saúde, mesmo em casa (p < 0,01). Além disso, mais de três quartos dos participantes da pesquisa incorporaram mudanças em seu comportamento para garantir sua segurança, ou seja, contato físico reduzido (86,5%) e visitas a unidades de saúde (74,5%), planos cancelados (84,5%) e lavagem das mãos mais frequentemente (87%). Como resultados, houve o aumento dos níveis de ansiedade que um indivíduo experimentava regularmente em relação à sua saúde, à saúde de seus próximos, a certos comportamentos de prevenção como resultado da doença e a mudanças de comportamento da amostra analisada.",Aspectos Psicocomportamentais durante da Pandemia da COVID-19: Uma análise dos efeitos provocados em moradores da região central de São Paulo (preprint)/ pt
"Introduction: In the absence of vaccines and specific drugs, prevention effort has been attributed as the primary control mechanism of COVID-19 Knowledge, attitude, and practice are used to determine the current situation and formulate appropriate control interventions as well as risk communication This study, therefore, aims to assess knowledge, attitude, practice and information needs about COVID-19 in Indonesian society Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey in the third week of August 2020 Purposive and random sampling was used to select the respondents People with a minimum age of 18 years and residing in Indonesia were allowed to participate in this study The survey was conducted with an online questionnaire that spread on several platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook by distributing the link and continuous chain messages on that platform Data were analysed using descriptive, chi-square and logistic regression test Results: A total of 816 respondents were included in this study In general, public knowledge about COVID-19 was sufficient, but some topic areas were still low Most people had a positive attitude about the COVID-19, but they provided a negative response to government policies Most of the community has taken preventive measures for COVID-19 However, some behaviours received a low percentage Information about how to prevent COVID-19 was the most wanted information during this pandemic Social media was a favourite source of information, with the most popular type of visualisation was a table containing numbers Age and education were significantly associated with knowledge Some attitudes were affected by age and occupation scope Gender and health insurance ownership significantly associated with preventive measures Conclusion: This research highlights the importance of providing valid, effective, efficient, and continuous information to the public through appropriate channels to increase understanding about COVID-19 precautions","Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Information Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia"
"Since its outbreak, COVID-19 has impacted world regions differentially. Whereas some regions still record tens of thousands of new infections daily, other regions have contained the virus. What explains these striking regional differences? We advance a cultural psychological perspective on mask usage, a precautionary measure vital for curbing the pandemic. Four large-scale studies provide evidence that collectivism (versus individualism) positively predicts mask usage-both within the United States and across the world. Analyzing a dataset of all 3,141 counties of the 50 US states (based on 248,941 individuals), Study 1a revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic US states. Study 1b replicated this finding in another dataset of 16,737 individuals in the 50 US states. Analyzing a dataset of 367,109 individuals in 29 countries, Study 2 revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic countries. Study 3 replicated this finding in a dataset of 277,219 Facebook users in 67 countries. The link between collectivism and mask usage was robust to a host of control variables, including cultural tightness-looseness, political affiliation, demographics, population density, socioeconomic indicators, universal health coverage, government response stringency, and time. Our research suggests that culture fundamentally shapes how people respond to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding cultural differences not only provides insight into the current pandemic, but also helps the world prepare for future crises.",Collectivism predicts mask use during COVID-19.
"Enhancing the embodiment of artificial limbs—the individuals' feeling that a virtual or robotic limb is integrated in their own body scheme—is an impactful strategy for improving prosthetic technology acceptance and human-machine interaction. Most studies so far focused on visuo-tactile strategies to empower the embodiment processes. However, novel approaches could emerge from self-regulation techniques able to change the psychophysiological conditions of an individual. Accordingly, this pilot study investigates the effects of a self-regulated breathing exercise on the processes of body ownership underlying the embodiment of a virtual right hand within a Spatially Augmented Respiratory Biofeedback (SARB) setting. This investigation also aims at evaluating the feasibility of the breathing exercise enabled by a low-cost SARB implementation designed for upcoming remote studies (a need emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic). Twenty-two subjects without impairments, and two transradial prosthesis users for a preparatory test, were asked (in each condition of a within-group design) to maintain a normal (about 14 breaths/min) or slow (about 6 breaths/min) respiratory rate to keep a static virtual right hand “visible” on a screen. Meanwhile, a computer-generated sphere moved from left to right toward the virtual hand during each trial (1 min) of 16. If the participant's breathing rate was within the target (slow or normal) range, a visuo-tactile event was triggered by the sphere passing under the virtual hand (the subjects observed it shaking while they perceived a vibratory feedback generated by a smartphone). Our results—mainly based on questionnaire scores and proprioceptive drift—highlight that the slow breathing condition induced higher embodiment than the normal one. This preliminary study reveals the feasibility and potential of a novel psychophysiological training strategy to enhance the embodiment of artificial limbs. Future studies are needed to further investigate mechanisms, efficacy and generalizability of the SARB techniques in training a bionic limb embodiment.",Exploring the Embodiment of a Virtual Hand in a Spatially Augmented Respiratory Biofeedback Setting

"About 4.25% of people have lost their lives due to COVID-19 disease, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In an unforeseen situation, approximately 25,000 frontline healthcare workers have also been infected by this disease while providing treatment to the infected patients. In this devastating scenario, without any drug or vaccine available for the treatment, frontline healthcare workers are highly prone to viral infection. However, some countries are drastically facing a shortage of healthcare workers in hospitals. Methods: The literature search was conducted in ScienceDirect and ResearchGate, using words ""Medical Robots"", and ""AI in Covid-19"" as descriptors. To identify and evaluate the articles that create the impact of robots and artificial intelligence in pandemic diseases. Eligible articles were included publications and laboratory studies before and after covid-19 and also the prospective and retrospective of application of Robots and AI. Conclusion: In this pandemic situation, robots were employed in some countries during the COVID-19 outbreak, which are medical robots, UV-disinfectant robots, social robots, drones, and COBOTS. Implementation of these robots was found effective in successful disease management, treatment, most importantly ensures the safety of healthcare workers. Mainly, the Disposal of deceased bodies and the location and transportation of infected patients to hospitals and hospitals were tough tasks and risk of infection. These tasks will be performed by employing mobile robots and automated guided robots respectively. Therefore, in the future, advanced automated robots would be a promising choice in hospitals and healthcare centers to minimize the risk of frontline healthcare workers.",Retrospective and prospective application of robots and artificial intelligence in global pandemic and epidemic diseases

"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Hematoma expansion after acute intracerebral hemorrhage is common and is associated with early deterioration and poor clinical outcome. The computed tomographic angiography (CTA) spot sign is a promising predictor of expansion; however, frequency and predictive values are variable across studies, possibly because of differences in onset-to-CTA time. We performed a patient-level meta-analysis to define the relationship between onset-to-CTA time and frequency and predictive ability of the spot sign. METHODS We completed a systematic review for studies of CTA spot sign and hematoma expansion. We subsequently pooled patient-level data on the frequency and predictive values for significant hematoma expansion according to 5 predefined categorized onset-to-CTA times. We calculated spot-sign frequency both as raw and frequency-adjusted rates. RESULTS Among 2051 studies identified, 12 met our inclusion criteria. Baseline hematoma volume, spot-sign status, and time-to-CTA were available for 1176 patients, and 1039 patients had follow-up computed tomographies for hematoma expansion analysis. The overall spot sign frequency was 26%, decreasing from 39% within 2 hours of onset to 13% beyond 8 hours (P<0.001). There was a significant decrease in hematoma expansion in spot-positive patients as onset-to-CTA time increased (P=0.004), with positive predictive values decreasing from 53% to 33%. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of the CTA spot sign is inversely related to intracerebral hemorrhage onset-to-CTA time. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of the spot sign for significant hematoma expansion decreases as time-to-CTA increases. Our results offer more precise risk stratification for patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage and will help refine clinical prediction rules for intracerebral hemorrhage expansion.",Predicting Intracerebral Hemorrhage Growth With the Spot Sign: The Effect of Onset-to-Scan Time.

"This chapter provides a detailed review and analysis of all the major reforms that were initiated and subsequently implemented by Malta’s Government from the year 2013 onwards, regarding policy making, coordination and implementation. It expands on the theme of the previous chapter that focused on the interaction of public policy with the public administrative framework. The Government’s progressive and contemporary policy design augmented the quality level through the application of standards;the reprioritisation of the political agenda;and the revamping of how key policy sectors are managed. These have changed significantly the country’s political direction. Significant advancement has been made in implementing national policies so that Malta is more compliant with EU directives. The structural reforms have resulted in a substantial increase in all revenue streams reflecting the sustained and robust performance of the Maltese economy. Despite all the policy reforms, the only constant feature is change. It is contended that much more policy reforms are required, especially in the new COVID-19 era, to transform the citizen’s lives drastically for the better. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Policy Making, Coordination and Implementation Government Reforms"

"To investigate the evolutionary history of the current pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a total of 137 genomes of coronavirus strains with release dates between January 2019 and 25 March 2020, were analyzed. To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5-related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4-related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus. Therefore, our results suggest that the human SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, could also come from yak as an intermediate host.","SARS-CoV-2: Structural diversity, phylogeny, and potential animal host identification of spike glycoprotein"
"Although there is an established comparative literature addressing electoral violence, and an emerging literature on violence against US officeholders, research has not examined levels of violence perpetrated by constituents against US candidates, nor how a crisis, such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, including the political polarization connected to it, may affect violence. This note presents findings from a survey of state house candidates from 18 US states in the 2020 electoral cycle. The findings focus on psychological violence and suggest that it is a common occurrence, and that the COVID‐19 pandemic and polarization may have affected it. Specifically, most candidates reported that: they believe that the pandemic led to violence;those in states with larger increases in COVID‐19 cases and those running in states with higher levels of COVID‐19 public political events reported more violence. In addition, candidates running in more polarized states experienced more violence.",Violence among State House Candidates during the COVID‐19 Pandemic
"BackgroundMany people are not recovering for months after being infected with COVID-19. Long Covid (LC) is a major public health problem that needs defining, quantifying and describing. We aimed to explore and develop understanding of LC symptoms following mild/moderate COVID-19 infection and describe its impact on daily life.MethodsThe survey was co-produced with people living with LC. Data was collected through an online social media survey mostly from online support groups using convenience non-probability sampling. The criteria for inclusion were adults with lab-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection managed in the community (non-hospitalised) in the first two weeks of illness. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic, and functional correlates.ResultsData from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.7 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.4–8.0) was analysed. The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% UK-based. 90% reported good, very good or excellent health prior to infection. Most participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing LC symptoms (17.6%). The most common initial symptoms that continued were exhaustion, headache, chest pressure/tightness and breathlessness. Cough, fever and chills were prevalent initial symptoms that became less so as the illness progressed. Cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more common beyond the acute phase. 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection (NAAT or antibody). The biggest difference in symptoms between those who reported testing positive and those who did not was loss of smell/taste. Physical activity, stress and sleep disturbance were the most common symptom triggers. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 66.4% reported taking time off sick, (median 60 days, IQR 20, 129). 37% reported loss of income due to illness. Eighty four percent of participants reported ongoing symptoms affecting at least three organ systems. There were two main ongoing symptoms clusters;the majority cluster (88.7%) exhibited mainly chest, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and the minority cluster (11.3%) exhibited multi-system symptoms which had persisted from the start. The multi-system cluster reported more severe functional impact.ConclusionThis is an exploratory survey of LC characteristics. Whilst it is a non-representative sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact. To better characterise ongoing illness and prognosis, research is needed in a representative population-sample using standardised case definitions (to include those not lab-confirmed in the first pandemic wave).",Characteristics of long COVID: findings from a social media survey
"Importance: The effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine protection remains poorly understood. Objective: To assess protection from SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection after mRNA vaccination among persons with vs without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Matched-cohort studies in Qatar for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. A total of 1 531 736 individuals vaccinated with either vaccine between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021, were followed up beginning 14 days after receiving the second dose until September 19, 2021. Exposures: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive nasopharyngeal swab regardless of reason for PCR testing or presence of symptoms. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. Results: The BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort comprised 99 226 individuals with and 290 432 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 37 years; 68% male). The mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort comprised 58 096 individuals with and 169 514 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 36 years; 73% male). Among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, 159 reinfections occurred in those with and 2509 in those without prior infection 14 days or more after dose 2. Among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, 43 reinfections occurred in those with and 368 infections in those without prior infection. Cumulative infection incidence among BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.15% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.18%) in those with and 0.83% (95% CI, 0.79%-0.87%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio for breakthrough infection with prior infection, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.15-0.21]; P < .001). Cumulative infection incidence among mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.15%) in those with and 0.35% (95% CI, 0.32%-0.40%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.48]; P < .001). Vaccinated individuals with prior infection 6 months or more before dose 1 had statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection than those vaccinated less than 6 months before dose 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.92]; P = .02 for BNT162b2 and 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.91]; P = .03 for mRNA-1273 vaccination). Conclusions and Relevance: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection among individuals receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines in Qatar between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021.

"This cross-national study investigated the extent of social media use (SMU) as a source of information about COVID-19, and its relationship with the experienced burden caused by the pandemic. Representative data from eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the UK, the USA) were collected online (end of May to the beginning of June 2020). Of the overall 8,302 participants, 48.1% frequently used social media (SM) as a COVID-19 information source (range: 31.8% in Germany, to 65.4% in Poland). In the overall samples and in all country-specific samples, regression analyses revealed the experienced burden caused by COVID-19 to be positively associated with SMU and stress symptoms. Furthermore, stress symptoms partly mediated the relationship between SMU and the burden. The results emphasize the significant association between the use of SM as a source of information, individual emotional state, and behavior during the pandemic, as well as the significance of conscious and accurate use of SM specifically during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Social Media as Source of Information, Stress Symptoms, and Burden Caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19) A Cross-National Investigation of Predictors"
"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged healthcare organizations across the globe, forcing innovation, resourcefulness, and flexibility. The purpose of this article is to describe the impact of clinical nurse specialist practice on COVID-19 preparation at a military hospital. ENVIRONMENT OF CARE CHANGES: The pandemic required facilities to develop expansion plans to facilitate a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Clinical nurse specialists collaborated to develop a plan to expand care capacity and streamline testing while designating specific critical care and medical-surgical areas for COVID-19 patients. STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS: To capitalize on the expanded bed capacity, clinical nurse specialists identified and trained outpatient nursing staff to serve as nurse extenders. DISCUSSION: Early in the pandemic, a lack of strong evidence-based interventions to mitigate transmission and treatment necessitated the development of innovative solutions.

"Owing to the frequent travel connections between Wuhan and Zhejiang, Zhejiang was the third worst-affected province in China with 1,205 cases confirmed before 26 February 2020. The transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was monitored in Zhejiang, accounting for the transmissions from imported cases. Even though Zhejiang was one of the worst-affected provinces, an interruption of disease transmission (i.e. instantaneous reproduction numbers <1) was observed in early/mid-February after a comprehensive set of interventions combating the outbreak.","Monitoring disease transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang, China"
"INTRODUCTION The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented time for the management of colorectal cancer, with uncertainty as to cancer-specific risks and the circumventing of gold standard oncological strategies. Our study aimed to acquire a snapshot of the practice of multidisciplinary team (MDT) management and variability in response to rapidly emerging guidelines. METHODS The survey was disseminated to 150 colorectal cancer MDTs across England and Wales taken from the National Bowel Cancer Audit data set between 15 April and 30 June 2020 for completion by colorectal surgeons. RESULTS Sixty-seven MDTs responded to the survey. Fifty-seven centres reported that they continued to perform colorectal cancer resections during the initial lockdown period. Fifty centres (74.6%) introduced routine preoperative COVID-19 testing and 50 (74.6%) employed full personal protective equipment for elective cases. Laparoscopic resections were continued by 25 centres (42.1%), whereas 28 (48.3%) changed to an open approach. Forty-nine (79.0%) centres reported experiencing patient-led surgical cancellations in 0-25% of their listings. If surgery was delayed significantly then 24 centres (38.7%) employed alternative neoadjuvant therapy, with short-course radiotherapy being their preferred adjunct of choice for rectal cancer. Just over 50% of the MDTs stated that they were uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with their management strategies. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates variability in the MDT management of colorectal cancer during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, incorporating adaptive patient behaviour and initially limited data on oncological safety profiles leading to challenging decision-making.",Colorectal resections during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey of practice during first lockdown.
"The role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has become a matter of urgent debate as societies in the US and abroad consider how to safely reopen schools. Small studies have suggested higher viral loads in young children.

"Multinational companies are now obliged to deliver an annual report to the tax authorities with information disaggregated by country (country-by-country reporting) in order to show where the assets and workers are allocated, how profits are distributed and to whom taxes are paid. Unfortunately, these reports are not made public in the European Union, thus preventing public scrutiny about the strategies used by multinational companies to displace profits to tax havens. This article applies the Unitary Taxation regime proposed by the European Commission to US multinational companies. The results confirm a strong bias among the profits distribution towards countries with lower corporate tax rates. Likewise, they confirm the capacity of the Unitary Taxation to promote a fairer distribution of tax revenues. These results can be a good contribution to the current Portuguese presidency of the European Union, which managed to gather important support to move forward with the European public country-by-country reporting directive.",Country-by-Country Reporting: A Step Towards Unitary Taxation?

"BACKGROUND: Encouraging upper limb use and increasing intensity of practice in rehabilitation are two important goals for optimizing upper limb recovery post stroke. Feedback from novel wearable sensors may influence practice behaviour to promote achieving these goals. A wearable sensor can potentially be used in conjunction with a virtually monitored home program for greater patient convenience, or due to restrictions that preclude in-person visits, such as COVID-19. This trial aims to (1) determine the efficacy of a virtual behaviour change program that relies on feedback from a custom wearable sensor to increase use and function of the upper limb post stroke; and (2) explore the experiences and perceptions of using a program coupled with wearable sensors to increase arm use from the perspective of people with stroke. METHODS: This mixed-methods study will utilize a prospective controlled trial with random allocation to immediate or 3-week delayed entry to determine the efficacy of a 3-week behaviour change program with a nested qualitative description study. The intervention, the Virtual Arm Boot Camp (V-ABC) features feedback from a wearable device, which is intended to increase upper limb use post stroke, as well as 6 virtual sessions with a therapist. Sixty-four adults within 1-year post stroke onset will be recruited from seven rehabilitation centres. All outcomes will be collected virtually. The primary outcome measure is upper limb use measured by grasp counts over 3 days from the wearable sensor (TENZR) after the 3-week intervention. Secondary outcomes include upper limb function (Arm Capacity and Movement Test) and self-reported function (Hand Function and Strength subscale from the Stroke Impact Scale). Outcome data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 2 months retention. The qualitative component will explore the experiences and acceptability of using a home program with a wearable sensor for increasing arm use from the point of view of individuals with stroke. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants after they have experienced the intervention. Qualitative data will be analysed using content analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will provide novel information regarding the efficacy and acceptability of virtually delivered programs to improve upper extremity recovery, and the use of wearable sensors to assist with behaviour change.

"BACKGROUND: Key infection prevention and control measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 include social distancing, hand hygiene, use of facemasks and personal protective equipment. However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. RESULTS: Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers. The videos were then further optimized with feedback from participants followed by another round of retesting. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed information on gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. This was used to produce targeted educational videos which addressed these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting. The resulting videos were then disseminated as a resource to aid in efforts to fight COVID-19 in Thailand and worldwide.","Improving knowledge, attitudes and practice to prevent COVID-19 transmission in healthcare workers and the public in Thailand"
"We propose a two-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification framework for detecting COVID-19 and Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) using the chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. In the first stage, an infection - COVID-19 or CAP, is detected using a pre-trained DenseNet architecture. Then, in the second stage, a fine-grained three-way classification is done using EfficientNet architecture. The proposed COVID+CAP-CNN framework achieved a slice-level classification accuracy of over 94% at identifying COVID-19 and CAP. Further, the proposed framework has the potential to be an initial screening tool for differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and CAP, achieving a validation accuracy of over 89.3% at the finer three-way COVID-19, CAP, and healthy classification. Within the IEEE ICASSP 2021 Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC) on COVID-19 Diagnosis, our proposed two-stage classification framework achieved an overall accuracy of 90% and sensitivity of .857, .9, and .942 at distinguishing COVID-19, CAP, and normal individuals respectively, to rank first in the evaluation.

"In the current study, attempts were made to analyze the effect of COVID‐19 lockdown on the heavy metal concentrations in River Gomti through comparison with pre‐COVID‐19 lockdown status. The concentration of all the six heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Pb) clearly shows a significant reduction, highlighting the impact of closure of agricultural, industrial, and commercial activities. The values of heavy metal pollution index (HPI) at all sites have also decreased with the maximum improvement at Site S1 (Chandrika Devi), signifying the impact of reduced agricultural runoff into the river from nearby fields. The correlation analysis stated a strong correlation between HPI and Cd, signifying the relatively high weightage of Cd in pollution levels. Findings from the Caboi diagram suggest classification of all water samples under the “near neutral‐low metal” category.","Assessment of the impact of COVID‐19 lockdown on the heavy metal pollution in the River Gomti, Lucknow city, Uttar Pradesh, India"
"The novel SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on breast radiology practices. Initially, nonessential imaging studies, including screening mammography, were curtailed and even temporarily halted when lockdowns were instituted in many parts of the United States. As a result, imaging volumes plummeted while health care institutions worked to ensure safety measures were in place to protect patients and personnel. As COVID-19 infection levels started to stabilize in some areas, breast radiology practices sought guidance from national organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and radiology specialty societies, to develop strategies for patients to safely return for screening mammograms and other outpatient imaging studies. Postponement of breast cancer screening has led to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment that could negatively affect patient outcomes for years to come. In order to continue to provide necessary imaging services, breast radiologists will need to face and overcome ongoing practical challenges related to the pandemic, such as negative financial impacts on practices and patients, the need for modifications in delivery of imaging services and trainee education, and differences in the health care system as a whole, including the shift to telehealth for clinical care. Nonetheless, despite the disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, the need for breast radiology procedures, including breast cancer screening, remains strong.",Breast Cancer Screening and the COVID-19 Pandemic
"Tumour angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are hallmarks of cancer and have been associated with tumour progression, tumour metastasis and poor patient prognosis. Many factors regulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in cancer including non-coding RNAs which are a category of RNAs that do not encode proteins and have important regulatory functions at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Non-coding RNAs can be encapsulated in extracellular vesicles called exosomes which are secreted by tumour cells or other cells in the tumour microenvironment and can then be taken up by the endothelial cells of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. The “delivery” of these non-coding RNAs to endothelial cells in tumours can facilitate tumour angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Here we review recent findings about exosomal non-coding RNAs, specifically microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, which regulate tumour angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in cancer. We then focus on the potential use of these molecules as cancer biomarkers and opportunities for exploiting ncRNAs for the treatment of cancer.",Control of Gene Expression by Exosome-Derived Non-Coding RNAs in Cancer Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis

"Indian economy witnessed a plummeted growth in past few years leading to recession. The entire economic activity all over the globe was disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To revive the economy out of recession, various monetary and fiscal stimulus measures were announced by the Government of India. The objective of this research was to assess the perception of various stakeholders with respect to the effects of these stimulus measures on reviving Indian economy. Based on the intensive discussion with academic experts and policymakers from corporates, five constructs of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures were developed. Web-based survey was conducted with 250 stakeholders from India. Confirmatory factor analysis technique was applied to confirm the constructs. The path analysis using structural equation modelling revealed that all five hypotheses, that is, monetary policy, labour and land law, taxation and subsidies, general business climates, and employee and consumer-related monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, positively and insignificantly affected economic recovery. This results showed a positive perception of stakeholders about the stimulus measures on reviving the Indian economy. However, the insignificant results suggested that unless these stimulus measures are implemented and monitored properly by the Government of India, they would not revive the Indian economy in near future.",On the Road to Recovery: The Role of Post-Lockdown Stimulus Package
"PURPOSE Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for gastric cancer is still uncommon because of technical difficulties, especially in esophagojejunostomy (EJ). There are many reports for various laparoscopic procedures of EJ using linear or circular staplers. On the other hands, there has been no report for hand-sewn anastomosis. We report successfully performed intracorporeally hand-sewn EJ after LTG. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinicopathologic data and short-term surgical outcomes of 6 patients who underwent totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy for upper gastric cancer from December 2010 and July 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The mean age was 66.5 years and mean body mass index (kg/m(2)) was 24.6. All patients had medical comorbidities. The mean patient ASA score was 2.17. Among the 6 patients, previous abdominal operation was performed for 2 patients and combined operation was performed for 3 patients. The mean blood loss, operation time, and EJ anastomosis time was 130 ml, 379.7 minutes, and 81.5 minutes, respectively. The mean time to first flatus, first oral intake, and postoperative hospital stay was 3.0, 3.0, and 12.5 days, respectively. There was no 30-day mortality case. Postoperative aspiration pneumonia and multiple periventricular lacunar infarctions developed in 1 patient. There were no anastomosis-related complications and other major surgical complications. CONCLUSIONS When the intracorporeal anastomotic technique becomes popular in LTG the intracorporeally hand-sewn EJ may be accepted as one method among the various laparoscopic procedures of EJ.",Totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy using intracorporeally hand-sewn esophagojejunostomy.
"Developing spatially controlled and universal p-type doping of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is critical for optoelectronics. Here, a facile and universal p-doping strategy via Sn4+ ions exchanging is proposed and the p-doping of PdSe2 is demonstrated systematically as the example. The polarity of PdSe2 can be modulated from n-type to bipolar and p-type precisely by changing the concentration of SnCl4 solution. The modulation effectively reduces the electron concentration and improves the work function by â¼72 meV. In addition, the solution-processable route makes the spatially controlled doping possible, which is demonstrated by constructing the lateral PdSe2 p-n homojunction with rectification behavior and photovoltaic effect. This p-doping method has been further proved in modulating various TMDs including WSe2, WS2, ReSe2, MoSe2, MoTe2, and PtSe2. This spatially controlled and universal method based on Sn atoms substitution realizes p-type doping of TMDs.",Universal p-Type Doping via Lewis Acid for 2D Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides

"It has been three months since the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, and people now have a more complete picture of the extent of the pandemic. Therefore, it is time to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The current population-based study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of people in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were randomly recruited and asked to complete a structured questionnaire, including the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the global rating of change scale and items related to COVID-19. Of the 500 respondents included in the study, 19% had depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) and 14% had anxiety (GAD score ≥ 10). In addition, 25.4% reported that their mental health had deteriorated since the pandemic. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that not experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, being worried about being infected by COVID-19, being bothered by having not enough surgical masks and being bothered by not being able to work from home were associated with a poorer mental health status.

"The intracellular availability of all biologically required transition metal ions in bacteria, e.g., Zn, Cu, Fe, as well as the detoxification of nonbiological heavy metal pollutants, is controlled at the molecular level by a panel of metalloregulatory or ""metal sensor"" proteins. Metal sensor proteins are specialized allosteric proteins that regulate the transcription of genes linked to transition metal homeostasis as a result of direct binding of a single metal ion or two closely related metal ions, to the exclusion of all others. In many cases, the binding of the cognate metal ion induces a structural change in a metal sensor oligomer that either activates or inhibits operator DNA binding. A quantitative measure of the degree to which a particular metal drives metalloregulation of transcription is the allosteric coupling-free energy, ΔG(c). In this chapter, we outline detailed spectroscopically derived methods for measuring metal binding affinity, K(Me), as well as ΔG(c) independent of K(Me), presented in the context of a simple coupled equilibrium scheme. Studies carried out in this way provide quantitative insights into the degree to which a particular metal ion is capable of driving allosteric switching, and via ligand substitution, the extent to which individual coordination bonds establish structural linkage of allosteric metal and operator DNA-binding sites.",Illuminating allostery in metal sensing transcriptional regulators.

"Since the rise of mass schooling in the 19th century, Americans have advocated for the teaching of science at nearly every level of the educational system The reasons for its inclusion in the school curriculum, though, have varied over the years The argument in the mid 1800s, for example, centered on the utilitarian value of scientific knowledge for industry and everyday affairs, while in the 1950s the study of science was viewed as important for building public support for research in the United States Towards the end of the 19th century there was a period of time when the predominant argument for science instruction rested on a moral purpose?the building of character and personal virtue For early proponents of science education, moral uplift came from student engagement in the process of science?in coming to face the facts of the natural world that were the basis for the discovery of truth This essay explores whether such goals for teaching science might once again have a place at a time when scientific expertize and knowledge are increasingly being minimized or dismissed",The lost moral purpose of science education
"The main aim of this research was to examine the role of optimism-pessimism, general trust and belief in conspiracy theories, in COVID-19 related fears, preventive and hoarding behaviors. We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear. Fear was related to all information sources suggesting that more information leads to higher intensity of fear – except information from the president which did not show any effect.","Optimism-pessimism, conspiracy theories and general trust as factors contributing to COVID-19 related behavior – A cross-cultural study"
"Force health protection (FHP) is defined as ""the prevention of disease and injury in order to protect the strength and capabilities"" of any service population. FHP was the foundational principal of the US Public Health Service (USPHS). President John Adams' signing of An Act for Sick and Disabled Seamen on July 16, 1798, marked the first dedication of US federal resources to ensuring the well-being of US civilian sailors and Naval service members. On January 4, 1889, President Cleveland enacted the USPHS Commissioned Corps, creating the world's first (and still only) uniformed service dedicated to promoting, protecting, and advancing the health and safety of the United States and the world. Building on the lessons of the 2014-2015 response to the Ebola virus pandemic, the Corps Care program was formalized in 2017 to establish and implement a uniform and comprehensive strategy to meet the behavioral health, medical, and spiritual needs of all Commissioned Corps officers. Its role was expanded in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has placed unprecedented demands on health care workers and spotlighted the need for FHP strategies. We describe the FHP roles of the Corps Care program for the resiliency of Commission Corps officers in general and the Corps' impact during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Abstract Gaps in hate crime and hate incident data are a major roadblock in increasing our understanding of the rising phenomenon of hate in the United States. In this paper, we reflect on the development of our geographically-integrated mobile application (the Hate Incident Reporting System) as an attempt to help close the gap in hate incident data. More broadly, we provide conceptual and methodological insights for working with sensitive Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) like hate incidents. We identify four key areas of attention in the process of developing digital tools for collecting sensitive VGI: i) participant motivation ii) data management and public research communication iii) accessibility iv) handling of geographic information and v) partnership with existing stakeholders. These factors are critical in the process of working with sensitive geographic data in an ethical fashion and ensuring maximum data reliability. Throughout each of these areas, the role of the ethical researcher stretches beyond academic research to accountability beyond academic research to accountability to participants in the form of tangible benefits.",Crowdsourcing sensitive VGI: Constructing the hate incident reporting system
"ABSTRACT Question(s): What is the impact of including an allied health assistant (AHA) role on physiotherapy service delivery in terms of service provision, scope of practice and skill mix changes in an acute respiratory service? Design: A pragmatic pre-post design study examined physiotherapy services across two three-month periods: current service delivery [P1] and current service delivery plus AHA [P2]. Outcome measures: Clinical and non-clinical activity contributing to physiotherapy services delivery quantified as number, type and duration (per day) of all staff activity, and categorised for skill level (AHA, junior, senior). Results: Overall physiotherapy service delivery increased in P2 compared to P1 (n=4730 vs n=3048). Physiotherapists undertook fewer respiratory (p < 0.001) and exercise treatments (p < 0.001) but increased patient reviews for inpatients (p < 0.001) and at multidisciplinary clinics in P2 (56% vs 76%, p < 0.01). The AHA accounted for 20% of all service provision. AHA activity comprised mainly non-direct clinical care including oversight of respiratory equipment use (e.g. supply, set-up, cleaning, loan audits) and other patient related administrative tasks associated with delegation handovers, supervision and clinical documentation (72%) and delegated supervision of established respiratory (5%) and exercise treatments (10%) and delegated exercise tests (3%). The AHA completed most of the exercise tests (n = 25). AHA non-direct clinical tasks included departmental management activities such as statistics and ongoing training (11%). No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Inclusion of an AHA in an acute respiratory care service changed physiotherapy service provision. The AHA completed delegated routine clinical and non-clinical tasks. Physiotherapists increased clinic activity and annual reviews. Including an AHA role offers safe and sustainable options for enhancing physiotherapy service provision in acute respiratory care services.",Physiotherapy service provision in a specialist adult cystic fibrosis service: a pre-post design study with the inclusion of an allied health assistant.
"Although non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons account for 0.7% of the U.S. population,* a recent analysis reported that 1.3% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported to CDC with known race and ethnicity were among AI/AN persons (1). To assess the impact of COVID-19 among the AI/AN population, reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 22-July 3, 2020 were analyzed. The analysis was limited to 23 states§ with >70% complete race/ethnicity information and five or more laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among both AI/AN persons (alone or in combination with other races and ethnicities) and non-Hispanic white (white) persons. Among 424,899 COVID-19 cases reported by these states, 340,059 (80%) had complete race/ethnicity information; among these 340,059 cases, 9,072 (2.7%) occurred among AI/AN persons, and 138,960 (40.9%) among white persons. Among 340,059 cases with complete patient race/ethnicity data, the cumulative incidence among AI/AN persons in these 23 states was 594 per 100,000 AI/AN population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 203-1,740), compared with 169 per 100,000 white population (95% CI = 137-209) (rate ratio [RR] = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.2-10.1). AI/AN persons with COVID-19 were younger (median age = 40 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 26-56 years) than were white persons (median age = 51 years; IQR = 32-67 years). More complete case report data and timely, culturally responsive, and evidence-based public health efforts that leverage the strengths of AI/AN communities are needed to decrease COVID-19 transmission and improve patient outcomes.","COVID-19 Among American Indian and Alaska Native Persons - 23 States, January 31-July 3, 2020"
"BACKGROUND: Amid the opioid crisis, the health care system is restructuring to prevent and treat COVID-19. Individuals in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) are uniquely challenged because of disruption to treatment, medication diversion, and isolation during the pandemic. METHODS: Between January and September 2020, we utilized the electronic medical record from a chain of 67 opioid agonist treatment clinics in Ontario, Canada, to examine routinely collected urine drug screen results of patients in opioid agonist treatment by Public Health Units. RESULTS: We present evidence of a 108% increase in the percentage of fentanyl positive urine drug screens from April to September (p< 0.001). During the same period, health regions in northern and southwestern Ontario, areas with a high concentration of rural communities, have seen the most notable increase in the percent of fentanyl positive urine drug screen results. CONCLUSION: The use of fentanyl increased by 108% among OAT patients in Ontario during the COVID 19 pandemic. We argue that the persistent increase of fentanyl exposure over time, specifically in the OAT population, suggests that reduced monitoring may decrease OAT's effectiveness and negatively impact patient outcomes.","Evidence of increased Fentanyl use during the COVID-19 pandemic among opioid agonist treatment patients in Ontario, Canada"
"Regulated secretory cells have two pathways that transport secreted proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. To identify carrier vesicles involved in regulated and constitutive secretion, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate to identify markers for the two secretory pathways, then mechanically permeabilized and incubated in vitro. Small constitutive secretory vesicles, containing mostly sulfated proteoglycans, accumulated during an in vitro incubation with ATP. In the presence of GTP gamma S, the constitutive vesicles became significantly more dense, suggesting that a coated intermediate was stabilized. Larger immature regulated secretory granules, enriched in sulfated secretogranin II, also escaped from the permeabilized cells in vitro. During granule maturation, their density increased and the amount of cofractionating proteoglycans diminished. The data suggest that sorting continues during secretory granule maturation.",Intermediates in the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways released in vitro from semi-intact cells
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical treatment and assess the knowledge and use of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment plan issued by the nation METHODS: A nationwide questionnaire survey on line was administered to medical staffs involved in COVID-19 treatment on February 28th, 2020 The questionnaire included drug treatment, respiratory support therapy, sedation and analgesia, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), etc RESULTS: There were 1 103 respondents, of whom 699 (504 doctors and 195 nurses) participated in the treatment of COVID-19 Finally, 432 doctors and 170 nurses from 9 provinces submitted valid questionnaires The results of the questionnaire surveys of doctors and nurses were basically the same Considering that doctors dominated in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, the results of the questionnaires of doctors were mainly analyzed The doctors participating in the survey were mainly from Hubei (29 2%), followed by Henan (24 5%), Guizhou (22 7%), and Guangxi (14 6%), etc 55 4% of the doctors came from tertiary three hospitals, and most of them have senior titles (56 4%) 232 doctors (53 7%) participated in the treatment of mild COVID-19, and 200 doctors (46 3%) participated in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients More than 95% of the doctors expressed that they would carry out antiviral treatment for patients with COVID-19 regardless of disease severity The main antiviral drugs included α-interferon (69 5%), lopinavir/ritonavir (65 0%), abidol (60 0%), and ribavirin (55 7%) The choice of antiviral drugs was highly consistent with the national treatment programs of COVID-19 At the same time, 95 5% of doctors would routinely prescribe antibiotics to severe and critically ill patients 94 0% of doctors agreed to prescribe low-dose glucocorticoid therapy to severe and critically ill patients About 2/3 of doctors would perform lung recruitment or prone position treatment for critical patients with invasive ventilation 79 0% of doctors preferred to use deep sedation for patients with invasive ventilation About 1/3 of doctors believed that CRRT should be initiated early, and nearly 1/3 of doctors suggested that ECMO should be used more aggressively in critically ill patients CONCLUSIONS: Medical staffs are familiar with the national treatment plan of COVID-19 and willing to follow it However, as a new disease, we have limited knowledge about COVID-19 and there are still many controversies Further practical training is needed to make clinicians more aware of the disease, and more evidence-based evidence is needed to guide clinical treatment",[Nationwide survey on clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in 9 provinces and municipalities]
"Background: COVID-19 is a public health emergency that is spreading worldwide and seriously affecting global economy. Information about the impact of HIV co-infection and anti-HIV drugs on the clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients remains limited. Methods: : In this retrospective study, the maximum body temperatures, fever duration, chest computed tomography changes and viral shedding, lymphocyte counts changes and titer of SARS-CoV-2 antibody were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without HIV infection in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20th to February 14th, 2020. Results: : Compared with 50 control COVID-19 patients, the two COVID-19/HIV co-infection patients had higher maximum body temperatures(40.2℃ and 40.3℃ vs 38.2℃), longer fever duration(11 days and 15 days vs 7 days), longer time of lung recovery(20 days and 24 days vs 14 days), shorter duration of viral shedding after the onset of symptoms(6 days and 4 days vs 10 days). Compared with three COVID-19 infection colleagues who had exposure history with the same COVID-19 patient, the third COVID-19/HIV co-infection patient had the same duration of viral shedding after exposure(29 days vs 29 days), lower titer of SARS-CoV-2 IgG(negative vs positive for all). Conclusion: For patients co-infected with HIV, the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection were diverse. The ability of those COVID-19/HIV co-infection patients with severe immunodeficiency to produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were weakened. The small sample in this study implied that the effects of anti-HIV drugs in prevention and treatment of COVID-19 appears to be limited.","Clinical Characteristics and Comparative Analysis of Covid-19 Patients With or Without HIV Coinfection in Wuhan, China"
"OBJECTIVES Surgical ablation is a well-known treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF); however, little is known about the absolute success rate. The aim of this study is to compare the absolute pre- and postoperative incidence of AF after minimally invasive surgical ablation for paroxysmal AF. METHODS Twenty consecutive patients (mean age 55 ± 8; 55% male) received a continuous loop monitor (CLM) 4 weeks prior to a minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation (MIPVI). The mean preoperative AF burden was compared with the mean AF burden during follow-up. Follow-up was achieved for a period of 12 months. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent an MIPVI successfully. Two patients did not reach the threshold for surgery. In 1 patient, surgery was discontinued because of a perioperative bleeding due to adhesions after a previous percutaneous AF ablation. Mean AF burden preoperatively was 66%. After 12 months, there was an absolute reduction in AF burden of 65% (95% CI 42-88, P < 0.001) and 12 of 15 patients in follow-up (80%) were free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). CONCLUSIONS The use of a CLM in the follow-up of surgical ablation is a very accurate way to confirm absolute surgical results. Furthermore, with the use of a CLM, preoperative evaluation can be done more accurately, and the surgical procedure can be adjusted to the patients' needs.",A new approach to determine the results of minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation using a continuous loop monitor: preliminary results.
"OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether Index60, a composite measure of fasting C-peptide, 60-min C-peptide, and 60-min glucose, could improve the metabolic staging of type 1 diabetes for progression to clinical disease (stage 3) among autoantibody-positive (Ab+) individuals with normal 2-h glucose values (<140 mg/dL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 3,058 Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Pathway to Prevention participants with 2-h glucose <140 mg/dL and Index60 <1.00 values from baseline oral glucose tolerance tests. Characteristics associated with type 1 diabetes (younger age, greater Ab+, higher HLA DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 prevalence, and lower C-peptide) were compared among four mutually exclusive groups: top 2-h glucose quartile only (HI-2HGLU), top Index60 quartile only (HI-IND60), both top quartiles (HI-BOTH), and neither top quartile (LO-BOTH). Additionally, within the 2-h glucose distribution of <140 mg/dL and separately within the Index60 <1.00 distribution, comparisons were made between those above or below the medians. RESULTS: HI-IND60 and HI-BOTH were younger, with greater frequency of more than two Ab+, and lower C-peptide levels, than either HI-2HGLU or LO-BOTH (all P < 0.001). The cumulative incidence for stage 3 was greater for HI-IND60 and HI-BOTH than for either HI-2HGLU or LO-BOTH (all P < 0.001). Those with Index60 values above the median were younger and had higher frequency of two or more Ab+ (P < 0.001) and DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 prevalence (P < 0.001) and lower area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels (P < 0.001) than those below. Those above the 2-h glucose median had higher AUC C-peptide levels (P < 0.001), but otherwise did not differ from those below. CONCLUSION: Index60 identifies individuals with characteristics of type 1 diabetes at appreciable risk for progression who would otherwise be missed by 2-h glucose staging criteria.",Index60 Identifies Individuals at Appreciable Risk for Stage 3 Among an Autoantibody-Positive Population With Normal 2-Hour Glucose Levels: Implications for Current Staging Criteria of Type 1 Diabetes

"OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence relating to the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: An umbrella review of systematic reviews was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methods. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane database of systematic reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched in March 2021 for reviews published in English. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers screened each abstract and independently reviewed full text articles. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, and the degree of overlap in primary studies was calculated. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews (100 unique studies), including 169 157 HCWs from 35 countries were included. The prevalence of anxiety among all HCWs ranged from 22.2% (95% CI 21.3% to 23.1%) to 33.0% (95% CI 31.9% to 34.1%). The prevalence of anxiety among physicians (n=5820) was reported to be between 17% and 19.8% and for nurses (n=14 938) between 22.8% and 27%. The prevalence of depression among all HCWs ranged from 17.9% (95% CI 17.1% to 18.8%) to 36% (95% CI 34.9% to 37.1%). The prevalence of depression among physicians (n=643) and nurses (n=8063) was reported to be 40.4% and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation evident in the presence of anxiety and depression among HCWs. In particular, the prevalence of depression among physicians was high.

"INTRODUCTION The role and application of robotic surgery are debated, particularly given the expansion of laparoscopy, especially laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. This cohort study was undertaken to delineate differences in outcomes between LESS and robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. METHODS With Institutional Review Board approval, patients undergoing LESS or robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy from September 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014, were prospectively observed, and data were collected. The results are expressed as the median, with the mean ± SD. RESULTS Thirty-four patients underwent a minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy: 18 with robotic and 16 with LESS surgery. The patients were similar in sex, age, and body mass index. Conversions to open surgery and estimated blood loss were similar. There were two intraoperative complications in the group that underwent the robotic approach. Time spent in the operating room was significantly longer with the robot (297 vs 254 minutes, P = .03), although operative duration (i.e., incision to closure) was not longer (225 vs 190 minutes; P = .15). Of the operations studied, 79% were undertaken for neoplastic processes. Tumor size was 3.5 cm for both approaches; R0 resections were achieved in all patients. Length of stay was similar in the two study groups (5 vs 4 days). There was one 30-day readmission after robotic surgery. CONCLUSIONS Patient outcomes are similar with LESS or robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Robotic operations require more time in the operating room. Both are safe and efficacious minimally invasive operations that follow similar oncologic principles for similar tumors, and both should be in the surgeon's armamentarium for distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.",Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy: a robotic or LESS approach.
"BACKGROUND In the early stage of dementia, persons living with dementia (PLwD) can identify their values and wishes for future care with a high degree of accuracy and reliability. However, there is a paucity of research to guide best practices on how best to incorporate advance care planning (ACP) in older adults diagnosed with mild dementia and therefore only a minority of these individuals participate in any ACP discussions. We developed an intervention called Voice Your Values (VYV) that healthcare professionals can implement to identify and document the values of PLwD and their trusted individuals such as friends or family. PURPOSE This single-group pre-test and post-test design aimed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the VYV intervention. METHODS A convenience sample of 21 dyads of PLwD and their trusted individuals were recruited from five outpatient geriatric clinics. The tailored VYV intervention was delivered to the dyads over two sessions using videoconferencing. RESULTS In terms of feasibility, the recruitment rate was lower (52%) than the expected 60%; the retention rate was high at 94%, and the intervention fidelity was high based on the audit of 20% of the sessions. In terms of preliminary efficacy, PLwD demonstrated improvement in ACP engagement (p = <0.01); trusted individuals showed improvements in decision-making confidence (p = 0.01) and psychological distress (p = 0.02); whereas a minimal change was noted in their dementia knowledge (p = 0.22). CONCLUSION Most of the feasibility parameters were met. A larger sample along with a control group, as well as a longitudinal study, are requisite to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of the promising VYV intervention. There is emerging evidence that people living with mild dementia can effectively participate in identifying and expressing their values and wishes for future care.","Voice your values, a tailored advance care planning intervention in persons living with mild dementia: A pilot study."
"Background Notwithstanding the clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 patients were reported, several critical issues still remain mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic factors as viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual's health conditions; myocarditis incidence rate and hallmarks. Methods Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct) value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21 January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. RESULTS In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group, regardless of the Ct values for N or ORF1ab gene of virus (all p<0.05).Typical CT abnormalities was more likely existing in the severe group than in the nonsevere group in patchy shadows or ground glass opacities, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening (all p<0.05). In addition, the PII values in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5 [42.5-62.5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6]; p<0.001). Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%) were noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme levels; whereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Multivariable logistic regress analysis distinguished three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19, including age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to 4.580); p=0.012], Ct value [OR 0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR 1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079); p=0.008]. Interpretation Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of epidemic regions.",COVID-19 Myocarditis and Severity Factors： An Adult Cohort Study
"Bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections result in millions of deaths worldwide and are currently the leading cause of death from infection. Acute inflammation is an essential element of host defense against infection, but can be damaging to the host when left unchecked. Effective host defense requires multiple lipid mediators, which collectively have proinflammatory and/or proresolving effects on the lung. During pulmonary infections, phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol can be chemically and enzymatically oxidized, as well as truncated and modified, producing complex mixtures of bioactive lipids. We review recent evidence that phospholipids and cholesterol and their derivatives regulate pulmonary innate and adaptive immunity during infection. We first highlight data that oxidized phospholipids generated in the lung during infection stimulate pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs and scavenger receptors, thereby amplifying the pulmonary inflammatory response. Next, we discuss evidence that oxidation of endogenous pools of cholesterol during pulmonary infections produces oxysterols that also modify the function of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Last, we conclude with data that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, both in the form of phospholipid acyl chains and through enzymatic processing into endogenous proresolving lipid mediators, aid in the resolution of lung inflammation through distinct mechanisms. Unraveling the complex mechanisms of induction and function of distinct classes of bioactive lipids, both native and modified, may hold promise for developing new therapeutic strategies for improving pulmonary outcomes in response to infection.",Role for phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol in pulmonary infections and inflammation
"BACKGROUND: Social media is one of the most rapid and impactful ways of obtaining and delivering information in the modern era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to rapidly obtain information on public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 in order to identify deficiencies in key areas of public education. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, a survey web link was posted on the social media and messaging platforms Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp by the study investigators. Participants, aged &#8805;18 years, filled out the survey on a voluntary basis. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, protective measures against COVID-19, and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the effects of age, gender, underlying illness, and working or studying in the health care industry on the perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5677 subjects completed the survey over the course of 1 week. ""Fever or chills"" (n=4973, 87.6%) and ""shortness of breath"" (n=4695, 82.7%) were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19. Washing and sanitizing hands (n=4990, 87.9%) and avoiding public places and crowds (n=4865, 85.7%) were identified as the protective measures most frequently used against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source for information on the disease (n=4740, 83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (n=2844, 50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger subjects (<35 years), males, and those working or studying in health care reported a higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care areas reported a lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19, with older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care sectors reporting a lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort implementing appropriate protective measures. However, key knowledge deficiencies exist with regards to vaccination against COVID-19, which future efforts should aim at correcting.","Perceptions, Knowledge, and Behaviors Related to COVID-19 Among Social Media Users: Cross-Sectional Study"
"As educators and administrators look to countless mobile apps, software programs, and web-based learning tools to meet the demands of students in remote, virtual, and hybrid settings, risks and assumptions of online platforms and assessments must be considered. With the urgency of the COVID-response closure of many schools and the unusual methods employed during the return to school in Fall 2020, there is no better time to examine the digital application literacy which is necessary for students to effectively transition to online learning and assessment. ?Digital application literacy? (DAppLit), a specific form of media literacy, involves the nimble use of an app (web-based) or application (computer-based) for education, including assessment. Learners with impaired DAppLit face academic consequences, when insufficient literacy in the platform is the culprit. This paper first explores various skills and strategies from both traditional and digital assessments that digital application literacy requires. Then, it presents the value of low-stakes assessment experiences with applications to introduce navigation techniques and troubleshoot barriers users may face before undertaking weighted assessments. The importance of skills instruction and practice of DAppLit methods is presented. A four-step process is introduced to: 1) set learning goals;2) guide learners through the application with explicit instructions before use;3) provide low-stakes explorations;and 4) debrief to address any issues which could represent a failing of application literacy and not content knowledge in an assessment.",The Role of Digital Application Literacy in Online Assessment
"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the overall healthcare performance of our re-organized urology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our department data was conducted between March 20, 2020, and April 16, 2020. All consecutive patients who received healthcare in both urology and emergency COVID-19 clinics by urologists during this period were included. We classified our healthcare into 4 categories: 1) Standard urological outpatient clinic procedures, 2) Urological emergency procedures, 3) Standard inpatient treatment clinic procedures and specific inpatient treatment clinic procedures for COVID-19 suspected cases, and 4) Specific emergency clinic procedures for COVID-19. Epidemiologic data and patient characteristics were analyzed using independent t test and chi-square test. RESULTS: Overall, the data of 990 patients were evaluated. Of these patients, 344 were seen in standard urology outpatient clinic and 212 were transferred from COVID-19 emergency clinic and hospitalized because of suspected COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-19 emergency clinic, 361 patients were seen by urologists in different shifts. Our workload was on behalf of COVID-19 cases. In our COVID-19 experience, there were no statistically significant differences between our suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients in terms of mean age, sex and age periods (p=0.30, p=0.77, and p=0.78, respectively). CONCLUSION: We successfully contributed to the national COVID-19 management program.

"The COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in most areas of the world caused many negative effects, including health, social and economic declined. One alternative to prevented it is to make immunostimulant supplements from natural resources that are available in surrounding environment along with encouraging development of home industries to produce them. In Kalimantan, Indonesia, one of the natural sources that have been utilized and proven locally as a medicinal plant is Bawang Dayak (Eleutherine bulbosa). One of its functions is as an immunostimulant supplement, but until now there has not been much research on the manufacture of E. bulbosa as a home industry product that functions as an immunostimulant supplement. E.bulbosa was demonstrated high antioxidant activity 1.48 μg/ml IC50 value and significantly increased immunity. The E.bulbosa was also contained iso-eleutherine and iso-eleutherol which have the potential as an anti-virus. In this study, several E. bulbosa derivated products, namely teabags and infusions, were introduced and compared starting from technical process, economic analysis, and storage period. Recent study showed that 1 kg of E. bulbosa can produce about 20 boxes of teabags (10 tea bags/box) that can be stored for 6-12 months, with a total profit reached 2-3 times of total production cost. While, 1 kg E. bulbosa was produced 16 bottles containing 330ml infusion drink which can be stored for 3-5 days in refrigerator, and it was provided 2 times profit of total production cost. However, these two products can be used as an alternative to stay healthy along with increase in added value and income for communities.",Comparison of Eleutherine bulbosa Derivated Products as an Immunostimulant Supplement for Preventing COVID-19 Transmission

"PURPOSE: The COVID-19-related shortage of ICU beds magnified the need of tools to properly titrate the ventilator assistance. We investigated whether bedside-available indices such as the ultrasonographic changes in diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) and the tidal swing in central venous pressure (ΔCVP) are reliable estimates of inspiratory effort, assessed as the tidal swing in esophageal pressure (ΔPes). METHODS: Prospective, observational clinical investigation in the intensive care unit of a tertiary care Hospital. Fourteen critically-ill patients were enrolled (age 64 ± 7 years, BMI 29 ± 4 kg/m(2)), after 6 [3; 9] days from onset of assisted ventilation. A three-level pressure support trial was performed, at 10 (PS10), 5 (PS5) and 0 cmH(2)O (PS0). In each step, the esophageal and central venous pressure tidal swing were recorded, as well as diaphragm ultrasound. RESULTS: The reduction of pressure support was associated with an increased respiratory rate and a reduced tidal volume, while minute ventilation was unchanged. ΔPes significantly increased with reducing support (5 [3; 8] vs. 8 [14; 13] vs. 12 [6; 16] cmH(2)O, p < 0.0001), as did the diaphragm TR (9.2 ± 6.1 vs. 17.6 ± 7.2 vs. 28.0 ± 10.0%, p < 0.0001) and the ΔCVP (4 [3; 7] vs. 8 [5; 9] vs. 10 [7; 11] cmH(2)O, p < 0.0001). ΔCVP was significantly associated with ΔPes (R(2) = 0.810, p < 0.001), as was diaphragm TR, albeit with a lower coefficient of determination (R(2) = 0.399, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation, ΔCVP is a better estimate of inspiratory effort than diaphragm ultrasound.

"During global pandemics, health-care decision makers often face critical shortages of life-saving medical equipment. How do medical stakeholders prioritize which patients are most deserving of scarce treatment? We report the results of three conjoint experiments conducted in the United States in 2020, testing for biases in US physicians', citizens' and elected politicians' preferences for scarce ventilator distribution. We found that all stakeholders prioritized younger patients and patients who had a higher probability of surviving with ventilator access. When patients' survivability was tied, physicians prioritized patients from racial/ethnic minorities (that is, Asian, Black and Hispanic patients) over all-else-equal white patients, religious minorities (that is, Muslim patients) over religious majority group members (that is, Catholic patients) and patients of lower socio-economic status over wealthier patients. The public also prioritized Black and Hispanic patients over white patients but were biased against religious minorities (that is, Atheist and Muslim patients) relative to religious majority group members. Elected politicians were also biased against Atheist patients. Our effects varied by political party-with Republican physicians, politicians and members of the public showing bias against religious minority patients and Democratic physicians showing preferential treatment of racial and religious minorities. Our results suggest that health-care stakeholders' personal biases impact decisions on who deserves life-saving medical equipment.",Patient traits shape health-care stakeholders' choices on how to best allocate life-saving care
"The Sláintecare report developed by political consensus sets out a ten year plan for achieving Universal Health Care (UHC) in Ireland. This paper evaluates the design and progress of the report to mid 2020, but with some reflection on the new COVID 19 era, particularly as it relates to the expansion of entitlements to achieve UHC. The authors explore how close Sláintecare is to the UHC ideal. They also review the phased strategy of implementation in Sláintecare that utilises a systems-thinking approach with interlinkages between entitlements, funding, capacity and implementation. Finally the authors review the Sláintecare milestones against the reality of implementation since the publication of the report in 2017, cognisant of government policy and practice. Some of the initial assumptions around the context of Sláintecare were not realised and there has been limited progress made toward expanding entitlements, and certainly short of the original plan. Nevertheless there have been positive developments in that there is evidence that Government's Implementation Strategy and Action Plans are focussing on reforming a complex adaptive system rather than implementing a blueprint with such initiatives as integrated care pilots and citizen engagement. The authors find that this may help the system change but it risks losing some of the essential elements of entitlement expansion in favour of organisational change.",Sláintecare implementation status in 2020: Limited progress with entitlement expansion
"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, intestinal parasites significantly affect the health and production of pigs. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the prevalence of Ascaris and Cryptosporidium infection in pigs in the Ejisu-Juaben Municipality of Ghana. METHOD: Faecal samples from two hundred (200) pigs on four different farms (labelled A, B, C, D) were processed using the Kinyoun modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for Cryptosporidium and the Formol-ether sedimentation method for Ascaris and microscopically examined to identify parasites to the genus level. RESULTS: The prevalence of Ascaris and Cryptosporidium in the pigs was 76% and 77%, respectively. The weaners had the highest Ascaris prevalence (96.15%) with the piglets recording the least (59.25%). On the other hand, the piglets had the highest prevalence (88.89%) for Cryptosporidium with the boars, sows and weaners recording 75.86%, 75.42% and 73.08% respectively. The prevalence of Ascaris was high in farm D (78.57%) while Cryptosporidium was highest in farm C (86.11%). Generally, there was a significant difference (p = 0.044) in the mean distribution of Cryptosporidium in the pigs. CONCLUSION: The high burden of Ascaris and Cryptosporidium infections in the pigs suggest the need to adopt and implement effective control measures.",Burdens of Ascaris spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. parasites in farm pigs in Ghana
"OBJECTIVE To formally compare the clinical course of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women with their nonpregnant counterparts. METHODS Clinical data of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in the designated hospitals of mainland China were retrieved up to April 12, 2020 through an epidemic reporting system maintained at the National Health Commission of the People's Republic China. Each pregnant patient was randomly matched to a nonpregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 in the same hospital as control, then their clinical courses were formally compared. RESULTS 138 pregnant women had been identified as confirmed COVID-19 cases. Among them, 17 severe cases and 1 maternal death were recorded, which was less than their nonpregnant peers (23 severe cases and 3 death). 57.2% had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the third trimester, including 13 severe cases and 1 maternal death. 7.3% of pregnant patients had diarrhea and 3.6% had nausea or vomiting, compared with related proportion as 15.2% (OR: 0.38, 95%CI: 0.15, 0.96) and 10.1% (OR: 0.25, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.89) in nonpregnant patients. Pregnant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy presented similar laboratory tests with their nonpregnant peers, however, with pregnancy progresses, increased inflammation, coagulation and hepatic injury markers happened more and more frequently (p<0.001) in pregnant patients. CONCLUSIONS Being pregnant did not represent a risk for severe condition when compared with their nonpregnant peers. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy were even at lower risk of severe illness than those infected in late pregnancy.",Clinical characteristics of pregnant women infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China: a nationwide case-control study

The study focused on The study aims to investigate the Gender-Based Work-Related Opportunities of Job Contract Employees at the Central Luzon State University, Philippines Under Pandemic (COVID-19) Conditions. The 58 job order/ contractual employees who served as respondents of the study were randomly selected among the pool of job order employees at the Central Luzon State University. The respondents were comprised of 31 (53.4%) females, the majority (58.6%) belonging to the age bracket of 15-24 years old. Most respondents are single (79%) while education-wise, the majority are college graduates (89.70). Classified accordingly to their assigned jobs, namely: Academic, Technical/ Research, Administrative/ Clerical, Creative/ Consultancy, Support/ Janitorial/ Utility/ Messenger, majority are assigned to administrative/ clerical job (43.90%).The common salary rate most are receiving is about PhP 10,972.00 for the exact amount while the highest at PHP 24, 940.00. Most of the respondents have no eligibilities (62.10%). Monetary factors yielded as the major employment consideration of the respondents for considering their current job set up, not necessarily that the compensation is outstanding but with further reasoning that their current job is better considering the tough competition for getting employed further substantiated for the need to immediately provide for the family. Meanwhile, the presence of consideration such as the opportunities to use skills and abilities, meaningfulness of the job, comfortable and safe environment and relationship with co-workers validates that these factors are present at their current job arrangement making them accepts their current employment status minus the job security of tenure.

Accordingly presented on the level of significance noted, the belief that a particular gender has its advantage and disadvantage in terms of employment surfaced to highly associated with the sex of the respondents with the male respondents tilted on the highly agree to agree on the scale while female tends to disagree. Meanwhile, on the statement that employment and job opportunities in the Philippines area gender-neutral placed second among the perception to be influenced by gender with the male respondents tend to agree more than the female respondents. Subsequently followed with the perception that gender is widely used and consciously used to exploit opportunities and on the job benefits with more male respondents agreed than the female respondents. The fourth perception associated with the sex of the respondents is the belief that fair opportunities in employment exist regardless of gender tends to be associated with gender, with more males tend to disagree with this statement while the female respondents' spectrum of responses tilts more in agreement on the scale. Meanwhile, gender and employability were viewed to be gender-neutral along with the other perceptions such as talents and skills are gender-based, gender dictates the success rate in career, gender dictates merits and promotions, and gender dictates rates and benefits and access to employment privileges are gender-based.",Gender-Based Work Related Opportunities of Job Contract Employees at the Central Luzon State University under Pandemic (COVID-19) Conditions
"The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system is a powerful method to identify and analyze binary protein interactions. In the field of virology, the Y2H system has significantly increased our knowledge of structure and function of viral proteins by systematically assessing intraviral protein interactions. Several comprehensive approaches to determine virus-host interactions have provided insight into viral strategies to manipulate the host for efficient replication and to escape host-derived countermeasures. To expand our knowledge of intraviral and virus-host protein interactions, we here present a Y2H protocol that is well suited for high-throughput screening. Yeast mating followed by liquid handling in a 96-well format as well as fluorescent readout of the reporter system provides a highly standardized and fully automated screening situation. The protocol can either be applied to screen complex host cDNA libraries or protein pairs arrayed for cross-testing. The ease of use, the cost-effectiveness as well as the robotic handling allows for extensive and multiple rounds of screening providing high coverage of protein-protein interactions. Thus, this protocol represents an improved “deep” screening method for high-throughput Y2H assays.",A High-Throughput Yeast Two-Hybrid Protocol to Determine Virus-Host Protein Interactions

"The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on Caribbean countries. These countries have lost billions of dollars in foreign capital. Although the region's peoples are currently being vaccinated, the damage already caused by Covid-19 remains immeasurable and will likely continue for many years. Irrespective of whether vaccination results in herd immunity, Caribbean countries not only face the unenviable challenge of recalibrating their economies post-Covid-19, but also the prospect of being hauled before arbitral tribunals in respect of claims brought by investors alleging breaches of investor protection standards as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. To the extent that there is a real risk of claims of this nature arising in future, this article contends that Covid-19, as an unprecedented event, exposes the asymmetrical nature of the international investment regime, and its inability to fully countenance the domestic realities of developing countries that are confronted with existential threats.

"Most of the diseases caused by viral infection are found to be fatal, and the diagnosis is difficult due to confusion with other causative agents. So, a highly efficient molecular-based advance detection technique, i.e., loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, is developed for diagnosis of viral infections by various workers. It is based on amplification of DNA at very low level under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specifically designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. This technique is found to be superior than most of the molecular techniques like PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR due to its high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity. Major advantage of LAMP method is its cost-effectiveness as it can be done simply by using water bath or dry bath. Here, in this review information regarding almost all the effective LAMP techniques which is developed so far for diagnosis of numerous viral pathogens is presented.",Rapid Detection of Viruses Using Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP): A Review
"Background: This study aimed to assess the quality of life associated with gender inequalities in formal workers and to determine the effect of sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors on the quality of life (QOL). Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 1270 workers. Quality of life was measured using the EUROHIS-QOL 8-Item and assessed in terms of psychological, environmental, social, and physical domains, while demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical variables served as explanatory variables. Analyses were performed using an ordinal logistic regression model whose significance level was 5%. Results: Of the participants, 80.2% were men, and 19.8% were women; the mean age was 34 (standard deviation: ±10) and 32 (±9) years, respectively. In all prediction scenarios, men were more likely to have a higher quality of life, especially in the physical (odds ratio: 2.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.60–2.93) and psychological (odds ratio: 2.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.51–2.91) domains. Conclusions: Men and women had significantly different levels of quality of life, and sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral variables partially clarified these differences, which were possibly established by a socio-historical process of construction of the work role determined by gender issues.",Gender Differences in the Quality of Life of Formal Workers
"ObjectiveTo estimate the dose-dependent effectiveness of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines to prevent severe illness in real-world conditions of Costa Rica, after the Delta variant became dominant. DesignObservational study; secondary analysis of hospitalisation prevalence. SettingNationwide adult population, Costa Rica. ParticipantsAll 3.67 million adults residents in Costa Rica by mid-2021. Public aggregated data of 5978 hospital records from 14th September to 20th October, 2021 and 6.1 million vaccination doses administered. InterventionsVaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech (78%) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (22%). Main outcome measuresPrevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalisations ResultsVaccine effectiveness to prevent hospitalisation (VEH) was estimated as 93.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.0 to 93.9) for complete vaccination and 76.7% (CI: 75.0 to 78.3) for single-dose vaccination among adults of all ages. VEH was lower and more uncertain among older adults aged 58 years and above: 92% (CI: 91% to 93%) for those who had received full vaccination and 64% (CI: 58% to 69%) for those who had received partial vaccination. Single-dose VEH declined over time during the study period, especially in the older age group. Estimates were sensitive to possible errors in the population count used to determine the residual number of unvaccinated people in groups with high vaccine coverage. ConclusionThe Costa Rican vaccination programme that administered Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are highly effective to prevent COVID-19-related hospitalisations after the Delta variant had become dominant. Moreover, a single dose is reasonably effective, justifying the continuation of the national policy of postponing the application for the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to accelerate the vaccination and increase the number of people being vaccinated. Timely monitoring of vaccine effectiveness is important to detect eventual failures and motivate the public based on information that the vaccinations are effective. Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on the topicC_ST_ABSO_LIThe Costa Rican Social Security Fund provides vaccinations in Costa Rica, and they use Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca for the vaccinations. The Delta variant became predominant in Costa Rica by September 2021 C_LIO_LIReal-world estimates of these vaccines effectiveness to prevent hospitalisations range from 90% to 98% for two doses and from 70% to 91% for a single dose.

"NYC Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H) is the largest safety net health care delivery system in the United States. Prior to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, NYC H+H served over one million patients, including the most vulnerable New Yorkers, and billed fewer than 500 telehealth visits monthly. Once the pandemic struck, we established a strategy to allow us to continue to serve existing patients and treat the surge of new patients. Starting in March 2020 we were able to transform the system using virtual care platforms through which we conducted almost 83,000 billable televisits in one month and more than 30,000 behavioral health encounters via telephone and video. Telehealth also enabled us to support patient-family communication, post-discharge follow-up, and palliative care for COVID-19 patients. Expanded Medicaid coverage and insurance reimbursement for telehealth played a pivotal role in this transformation. As we move to a new blend of virtual and in-person care, it is vital that the major regulatory and insurance changes undergirding our COVID-19 telehealth response be sustained to protect access for our most vulnerable patients.

"OBJECTIVE Aneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and its branches are rare and account for only 6-15% of all visceral artery aneurysms. We present our 30-year experience with management of aneurysms of the SMA and its branches at a high-volume referral center. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with an aneurysm of the SMA or one of its branches from 1988 to 2018 was performed. Pseudoaneurysms and mycotic aneurysms were excluded. Clinical presentation, etiology, aneurysm shape and size, treatment modalities and outcomes were analyzed. Growth rate of aneurysms was estimated using linear regression. RESULTS 131 patients with 144 aneurysms were reviewed. Patients were primarily male (64%) with a median age of 60. There were 57 fusiform, 30 saccular and 57 dissection-associated aneurysms. 41 patients had an isolated SMA branch aneurysm. Degenerative aneurysms were the most common etiology (66%). 35 patients (27%) were symptomatic at presentation. 111 aneurysms had multiple computed tomography angiograms (CTA) with a median follow-up of 43.6 months (IQR 10.6-87.2 months). Only 18 aneurysms (16%) had an estimated growth rate of ≥1.0 mm per year. Initial aneurysm size was significantly associated with growth rate for fusiform aneurysms (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.0-1.3], P = 0.02) but not saccular (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.76-1.1], P = 1.1) or dissection-associated aneurysms (OR 1.2 [95% CI 0.91-1.5], P = 0.20). Acute abdominal pain (OR 5.9 [95% CI 1.6-22]; P = 0.01) and chronic abdominal pain (OR 3.7 [95% CI 1.1-13]; P = 0.04) were associated with aneurysm growth. There were only two ruptures, both of whom had diagnoses of fibromuscular dysplasia and systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively, whom presented as rupture with no prior imaging. 46 patients (34%) underwent operative repair with an average aneurysm size of 24.0 ± 8.6 mm, including 36 open revascularizations and 8 endovascular procedures. There was one perioperative death and nine patients had perioperative complications (25%). There were 91 aneurysms <20 mm with an average size of 13.4 ± 3.1 mm followed over a median of 120.8 months (IQR 30.5-232.2 months), and there were no ruptures within this cohort during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION This study represents one of the largest series on aneurysms of the SMA and its branches. Aneurysms of the SMA are relatively stable. Patients with symptomatic and fusiform aneurysms have a higher risk of growth. Aneurysms <20 mm of degenerative etiology may be safely monitored without treatment.",Aneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery and its branches.
"Broad testing for respiratory viruses among persons under investigation (PUIs) for SARS-CoV-2 has been performed inconsistently, limiting our understanding of alternative viral infections and co-infections in these patients. RNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers an agnostic tool for the detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA respiratory viruses in PUIs. Herein, we used RNA mNGS to assess the frequencies of alternative viral infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative PUIs (n=30) and viral co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive PUIs (n=45). mNGS identified all viruses detected by routine clinical testing (Influenza A (N=3), Human metapneumovirus (N=2), Human coronavirus OC43 (N=2) and Human coronavirus HKU1(N=1)). mNGS also identified both co-infections (1, 2.2%) and alternative viral infections (4, 13.3%) that were not detected by routine clinical workup (Respiratory syncytial virus (N=3), Human metapneumovirus (N=1), Human coronavirus NL63 (N=1)). Among SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive PUIs, lower cycle threshold (CT) values correlated with greater SARS-CoV-2 read recovery by mNGS (R2: 0.65, p-value: <0.001). Our results suggest that current broad-spectrum molecular testing algorithms identify most respiratory viral infections among SARS-CoV-2 PUIs, when available and implemented consistently.",Metagenomic sequencing to detect respiratory viruses in persons under investigation for COVID-19.
"Background: : The COVID-19 pandemic has been uniquely challenging for pregnant and postpartum women. Uncontrollable stress amplifies risk for maternal depression and anxiety, which are linked to adverse mother and child outcomes. This study examined change in internalizing symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant and postpartum women longitudinally, and investigated moderation by loneliness and other contextual risk factors. Methods: : 135 women (M ageâ¯=â¯31.81; 26% Latina, 55% non-Hispanic White, 11% Black; 39% low-income) enrolled in an existing prospective study completed self-report questionnaires including the EPDS and STAI-short form during early pregnancy, prior to COVID-19, and during COVID-19. Results: : Depressive symptoms were higher during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 and just as high as during early pregnancy. Anxiety symptoms were higher during COVID-19 compared to both pre-COVID-19 and early pregnancy. Higher loneliness was associated with increased depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Greater COVID-19 specific adversity was linked to greater increases in internalizing symptoms during COVID-19. Lower income-to-needs-ratio most strongly predicted symptoms during early pregnancy. Limitations: The present study is longitudinal, but the correlational nature of the data precludes causal conclusions regarding the effect of the pandemic on mental health. Conclusion: Longitudinal analyses suggest the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased internalizing symptoms among diverse pregnant and postpartum women. Interpersonal and contextual factors exacerbate risk and the impact of the pandemic on women's mental health. Identifying mothers at-risk for depression and anxiety may increase treatment utilization, mitigate fetal and infant exposure to maternal depression and anxiety, and help prevent adverse child outcomes.",Mental health of pregnant and postpartum women in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
"BACKGROUND: China is still faced with the public health challenge of tuberculosis (TB), and a robust surveillance system is critical for developing evidence-based TB control policies. The Tuberculosis Information Management System (TBIMS), an independent system launched in 2005, has encountered several challenges in meeting the current needs of TB control. The Chinese government also planned to establish the National Health Information System (NHIS) aggregating data in different areas. The China National Health Commission-Gates TB Project Phase III launched a new TB surveillance system to address these challenges and also as a pilot for the countrywide implementation of the NHIS. This commentary highlights the improvements and challenges in implementing the new TB system and also discusses the implications for the roll-out of the NHIS. MAIN TEXT: The new TB surveillance system piloted in each prefecture of the project provinces was designed based on the local information system under the unified principle of organizing patient information under a unique ID and realizing the function of data exchange. Upon mid-2019, the data exchange successful rate reached almost 100%, and the system showed good performance in data completeness. Major improvements of the new system included achieving automatic data extraction instead of manual entry, assisting clinical service provision, and the augmented statistical functions. The major challenges in the implementation and scale-up of the new system were the licensing issue and the diversities of infrastructures that hinder the promotion of the new system at a low cost. This pilot also accumulated experiences for the roll-out of the NHIS regarding the technical solutions of reforming current information systems as well as effective training approaches for the developers and users of the new system. CONCLUSIONS: The successful implementation of the new TB surveillance system in the three TB designated medical institutions demonstrated how the diverse infrastructures of the information system could be reformed to achieve the functions of automatic data extraction and data exchange and better cater to the needs of healthcare workers. This pilot also accumulated rich experiences and lessons learnt for developing technical solutions and personnel training for the scale-up of the NHIS.

"Thompson discusses a tradition of environmental justice movements as a model for a postpandemic public. The novel coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent response have laid bare the overall feebleness of public life in the US. The pandemic has made even more concrete the long-standing inequalities and injustices of the society by disproportionately affecting communities already disadvantaged in areas like income, health care, and housing. Some optimistic public thinkers have urged that this moment might be an opportunity to deliberate together about how to develop institutions of greater justice and the common good, while others argue that the historical record belies such a rosy view. Viewing environmental justice through this pragmatic lens as public theology highlights what is believed to be essential elements of public theology for today.",Environmental Justice as Counterpublic Theology: Reflections for a Postpandemic Public
"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global context in which social isolation has become normative in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. As a result of social distancing policies, the risk for loneliness and associated decline in quality of life has increased. The current study examined factors associated with loneliness and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic cross-sectionally (n = 797) and longitudinally (n = 395). Older age and larger social network size were associated with less loneliness, whereas having multiple physical or mental health diagnoses was associated with greater loneliness. Greater virtual social contact was also associated with increased loneliness. Greater loneliness was associated with all domains of quality of life both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Understanding factors associated with loneliness is critical to developing effective strategies at reducing loneliness and improving quality of life during the pandemic. Contrary to popular perceptions, older age was associated with less loneliness and more virtual social contact was associated with more loneliness. Thus, it may be prudent to deemphasize virtual social contact in public campaigns and to emphasize safe methods of interacting in person.",Predictors and consequences of loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The immunothrombosis could occur during infection with viruses. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a devastating condition that usually involves the lower extremities. The typical course of DVT is associated with an episode of enormous limb swelling and pain. In this case report, we aimed to present one of the COVID-19 possible complications: DVT in a 38 years old man infected with SARS-CoV-2. A 38 years old man presented with leg pain. He had a dry cough and fatigue suspicious symptoms of COVID-19. For further evaluations, the lung Computed Tomography scan (CT-scan), labratorical assessments, and doppler sonography of the common femoral vein (CFV) of both legs were done. Also, for investigating the other underlying causes of DVT, abdominopelvic CT-scan and lumbosacral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were done. The CT-scan showed GroundGlass Opacity (GGO) view. Labratorical assessment proposed a thrombotic condition. The doppler sonography of the CFV of both legs revealed a massive thrombosis in the left CFV suggesting an acute DVT. Abdominopelvic CT-scan and lumbosacral MRI were negative for other underlying causes of DVT.

"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a newly discovered second messenger that gates two pore channels 1 (TPC1) and 2 (TPC2) to elicit endo-lysosomal (EL) Ca(2+) release. NAADP-induced lysosomal Ca(2+) release may be amplified by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) mechanism. NAADP-induced intracellular Ca(2+) signals were shown to modulate a growing number of functions in the cardiovascular system, but their occurrence and role in cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells (C-MSCs) is still unknown. Herein, we found that exogenous delivery of NAADP-AM induced a robust Ca(2+) signal that was abolished by disrupting the lysosomal Ca(2+) store with Gly-Phe β-naphthylamide, nigericin, and bafilomycin A1, and blocking TPC1 and TPC2, that are both expressed at protein level in C-MSCs. Furthermore, NAADP-induced EL Ca(2+) release resulted in the Ca(2+)-dependent recruitment of ER-embedded InsP(3)Rs and SOCE activation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed clearly visible membrane contact sites between lysosome and ER membranes, which are predicted to provide the sub-cellular framework for lysosomal Ca(2+) to recruit ER-embedded InsP(3)Rs through CICR. NAADP-induced EL Ca(2+) mobilization via EL TPC was found to trigger the intracellular Ca(2+) signals whereby Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) induces C-MSC proliferation. Furthermore, NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) release was required to mediate FBS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not Akt, phosphorylation in C-MSCs. These finding support the notion that NAADP-induced TPC activation could be targeted to boost proliferation in C-MSCs and pave the way for future studies assessing whether aberrant NAADP signaling in C-MSCs could be involved in cardiac disorders.",Nicotinic Acid Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Induces Intracellular Ca(2+) Signalling and Stimulates Proliferation in Human Cardiac Mesenchymal Stromal Cells

"Background: Travel restrictions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped interviewing for fellowships into a predominantly virtual process. How this impacts Obstetrics & Gynecology (OB/GYN) resident approaches to fellowship application and Match navigation is largely unknown. Methods: : We performed a cross-sectional survey study of fourth year OB/GYN residents who participated in at least one virtual fellowship interview in 2020. We collected information regarding demographics, application strategy, perceived strengths and weaknesses of virtual interviews, and confidence with rank list creation. Descriptive statistics were used for categorical variables and responses pre- and post- match were compared using Fisher’s exact test. Results: : 75 out of an estimated 490 applicants (~15% response rate) completed the survey. 65.3% felt they interviewed at more programs virtually than they would anticipate completing in person, but perceived less confidence in having the necessary information (n=45, 60%) or understanding the culture of programs (n=59, 78.7%) to create a rank list. Cost savings were the main benefit of virtual interviews (n=50, 66.7%), and inability to get a true “feel” for a program was the biggest limitation (n=43, 57.3%). A majority (46.7%) advocate for a future hybrid interview process. Conclusions: : OB/GYN residents pursuing fellowship reported interviewing at more programs during the virtual season, but had less confidence with rank list creation. Cost savings benefits are weighed against difficulty getting a “feel” for programs virtually. Most would advocate for a future hybrid interview process.",Obstetrics and Gynecology resident perception of virtual fellowship interviews
"This article shows our work for developing an elder care platform for social interaction and physical and cognitive stimulation using the Pepper robot and Android OS as clients, based on the knowledge acquired on our long-term social robotics research experience. The first results of the user’s acceptance of the solution are presented in this article. The platform is able to provide different services to the user, such as information, news, games, exercises or music. The games, which have a bi-modal way of interacting (speech and a touch screen interface), have been designed for cognitive stimulation based on the items of the mini-mental state examination. The results of the user’s performance are stored in a cloud database and can be reviewed by therapists through a web interface that also allows them to establish customized therapy plans for each user. The platform has been tested and validated, first using adult people and then deployed to an elder care facility where the robot has been interacting with users for a long period of time. The results and feedback received have shown that the robot can help to keep the users physically and mentally active as well as establish an emotional link between the user and the robot.",Development and Usability Validation of a Social Robot Platform for Physical and Cognitive Stimulation in Elder Care Facilities
"Claims have a lot of space in construction projects, as they can have a considerable monetary value and thus negatively affect the final amount and duration of the project. This study seeks to suggest a building information modeling (BIM) approach to reduce most of the root causes of claims during the design phase. Thus, claims can be reduced during the project implementation phase. A questionnaire form was designed and distributed to 28 experts to obtain expert opinions on construction claims’ most important causes. In return, data were collected for 128 projects in Iraq, and the reasons for claims were extracted from them. After making the match between experts’ opinions and real projects, it was found that the match rate is high and that there are sixteen critical reasons for construction claims in Iraqi projects. After matching these causes with the BIM functions, a flowchart of each cause is drawn, and the inputs, tools, and outputs of the process are identified. The results showed the ability of BIM to prevent eight significant causes of claims (inaccurate quantities, excessive change orders, errors and design changes, flaws in drawings and specifications, and poor coordination between designers (structural, architectural, MEP)) through these BIM functions (3D visualization, clash detection, coordination, and take-off). The main results applied to a realistic case study show that BIM technology can be used as a precautionary approach during the design stage to reduce claims during implementation by (55.2%) so that the functions of this technology can solve the fundamental causes of claims in the construction projects sector in Iraq.",Facilitating claims settlement using building information modeling in the school building projects
"Impaired sense of smell occurs in a fraction of patients with COVID-19 infection, but its effect on cerebral activity is unknown. Thus, this case report investigated the effect of COVID-19 infection on frontotemporal cortex activity during olfactory stimuli. In this preliminary study, patients who recovered from COVID-19 infection (n = 6) and healthy controls who never contracted COVID-19 (n = 6) were recruited. Relative changes in frontotemporal cortex oxy-hemoglobin during olfactory stimuli was acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The area under curve (AUC) of oxy-hemoglobin for the time interval 5 s before and 15 s after olfactory stimuli was derived. In addition, olfactory function was assessed using the Sniffin’ Sticks 12-identification test (SIT-12). Patients had lower SIT-12 scores than healthy controls (p = 0.026), but there were no differences in oxy-hemoglobin AUC between healthy controls and patients (p > 0.05). This suggests that past COVID-19 infection may not affect frontotemporal cortex function, and these preliminary results need to be verified in larger samples.",Comparison of Brain Activation Patterns during Olfactory Stimuli between Recovered COVID-19 Patients and Healthy Controls: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Study
"Bioaerosols, including infectious diseases such as COVID-19, are a continuous threat to global public safety. Despite their importance, the development of a practical, real-time means of monitoring bioaerosols has remained elusive. Here, we present a novel, simple, and highly efficient means of obtaining enriched bioaerosol samples. Aerosols are collected into a thin and stable liquid film by the unique interaction of a superhydrophilic surface and a continuous two-phase centrifugal flow. We demonstrate that this method can provide a concentration enhancement ratio of ∼2.4 × 106 with a collection efficiency of ∼99.9% and an aerosol-into-liquid transfer rate of ∼95.9% at 500 nm particle size (smaller than a single bacterium). This transfer is effective in both laboratory and external ambient environments. The system has a low limit of detection of <50 CFU/m3air using a straightforward bioluminescence-based technique and shows significant potential for air monitoring in occupational and public-health applications.",Enriched Aerosol-to-Hydrosol Transfer for Rapid and Continuous Monitoring of Bioaerosols.
"Globally, the confirmed coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases are being increasing day by day. Coronavirus (COVID-19) causes an acute infection in the respiratory tract that started spreading in late 2019. Huge datasets of SARS-CoV2 patients can be incorporated and analyzed by machine learning strategies for understanding the pattern of pathological spread and helps to analyze the accuracy and speed of novel therapeutic methodologies, also detect the susceptible people depends on their physiological and genetic aspects. To identify the possible cases faster and rapidly, we propose the Artificial Intelligence (AI) power screening solution for SARS- CoV2 infection that can be deployable through the mobile application. It collects the details of the travel history, symptoms, common signs, gender, age and diagnosis of the cough sound. To examine the sharpness of pathomorphological variations in respiratory tracts induced by SARS-CoV2, that compared to other respiratory illnesses to address this issue. To overcome the shortage of SARS-CoV2 datasets, we apply the transfer learning technique. Multipronged mediator for risk-averse Artificial Intelligence Architecture is induced for minimizing the false diagnosis of risk-stemming from the problem of complex dimensionality. This proposed application provides early detection and prior screening for SARS-CoV2 cases. Huge data points can be processed through AI framework that can examine the users and classify them into “Probably COVID”, “Probably not COVID” and “Result indeterminate”.",AI-based Power Screening Solution for SARS-CoV2 Infection: A Sociodemographic Survey and COVID-19 Cough Detector
"The ability to make risky decisions in stressful contexts has been largely investigated in experimental settings. We examined this ability during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, when in Italy people were exposed to a prolonged stress condition, mainly caused by a rigid lockdown. Participants among the general population completed two cognitive tasks, an Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which measures individual risk/reward decision-making tendencies, and a Go/No-Go task (GNG), to test impulsivity, together with two questionnaires, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales. The Immune Status Questionnaire was additionally administered to explore the impact of the individual health status on decision making. The effect of the questionnaires scores on task performance was examined. The results showed that higher levels of perceived stress and a more self-reported vulnerable immune status were associated, separately, with less risky/more advantageous choices in the IGT in young male participants but with more risky/less advantageous choices in older male participants. These effects were not found in female participants. Impulsivity errors in the GNG were associated with more anxiety symptoms. These findings bring attention to the necessity of taking into account decision-making processes during stressful conditions, especially in the older and more physically vulnerable male population.",Impact of Perceived Stress and Immune Status on Decision-Making Abilities during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown
"Although attention has been paid to the relationship between malignant diseases and cardiovascular diseases, few data have been reported. Moreover, there have also been few reports in which the preventive factors were examined in patients with or without malignant disease histories requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study. A total of 1003 post-PCI patients were divided into a malignant group, with current or past malignant disease, and a nonmalignant group. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and admission due to heart failure within 5 years of PCI. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher probability of the primary endpoint in the malignant group (P = .002). Multivariable Cox hazard analyses showed that in patients without a history of malignant, body mass index (BMI) and the presence of dyslipidemia were independent and significant negative predictors of the primary endpoint (BMI: hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.99, P = .041; prevalence of dyslipidemia: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, P = .048), and the presence of multi-vessel disease (MVD) and the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were independent and significant positive predictors of the primary endpoint (prevalence of MVD: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.18-2.40, P = .004; prevalence of PAD: HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03-2.21, P = .034). In patients with histories of malignancy, no significant independent predictive factors were identified.Patients undergoing PCI with malignancy had significantly higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events but might not have the conventional prognostic factors.",Differential predictive factors for cardiovascular events in patients with or without cancer history.
"Objectives: This presentation aims to describe the unique opportunities and challenges encountered in the development and delivery of telepsychiatric consultation services through the Michigan Child Psychiatry Access Program (MC3). We will specifically address outreach to vulnerable populations, and to adaptations during the time of COVID-19. Methods: A review of existing program data will describe the populations served, number of consultations provided, naming of types of services offered, funding relationships, and current state of service delivery within the MC3 program. Results: Over the course of 10 years, the MC3 program has provided 8500 consultations to pediatric primary care and perinatal providers. Pilot programming has also included services to populations of specific need, particularly the children and families of Flint, and the Tribal Health Centers of Michigan. The most common diagnoses discussed are related to anxiety, depression, and ADHD. During 2020, approximately 30% of consultations were related to the impact of COVID-19. The rate of consultation during the initial period of the pandemic fell by 37% from the year prior, and beginning in November of 2020, the rate of consultation resumed to rates maintained prior to the pandemic. We will present more detailed demographic data on the sociodemographic representation of patients we consulted on during the pandemic time period. We will also describe additional education efforts that include 87 live and recorded educational presentations on a variety of topics. Conclusions: Scaffolding a telepsychiatry program such as MC3 requires significant foundational and ongoing resources. A dedicated staff, ongoing relationships with the existing community mental health infrastructure, and sustainable funding allow for this program to be responsive to the changing needs of a state’s population. Despite this, significant work remains to leverage this service as a tool to narrow healthcare disparities in child mental health. Responsive changes to data collection and direct engagement with local community mental health centers can allow for the identification of needs specific to certain populations, particularly during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a crisis that is challenging national and local governments to innovate in their response to novel problems. Despite similarities to the challenges confronted in developed countries, Latin American governments face these problems amplified by structural obstacles such as social inequalities. These countries need to respond with capacities and resources often limited by spoils systems, as well as social and political polarization. In this context, we provide an overview of some innovative practices happening in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and México. In particular, we concentrate on some salient collaborative efforts in the region. To draw some lessons from these practices, we focus on the formal and informal institutions that facilitate or obstruct collaborations across jurisdictions. Moreover, we discuss our findings in terms of transaction costs for collaboration identified in these experiences.",The Transaction Costs of the Governments' Response to the COVID-19 Emergency in Latin America
"The ubiquitous cloud computing services provide a new paradigm to the work-from-home environment adopted by the enterprise in the unprecedented crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the change in work culture would also increase the chances of the cybersecurity attack, MAC spoofing attack, and DDoS/DoS attack due to the divergent incoming traffic from the untrusted network for accessing the enterprise’s resources. Networks are usually unable to detect spoofing if the intruder already forges the host’s MAC address. However, the techniques used in the existing researches﻿ mistakenly classify the malicious host as the legitimate one. This paper proposes a novel access control policy based on a zero-trust network by explicitly restricting the incoming network traffic to substantiate MAC spoofing attacks in the software-defined network (SDN) paradigm of cloud computing. The multiplicative increase and additive decrease algorithm helps to detect the advanced MAC spoofing attack before penetrating the SDN-based cloud resources. Based on the proposed approach, a dynamic threshold is assigned to the incoming port number. The self-learning feature of the threshold stamping helps to rectify a legitimate user’s traffic before classifying it to the attacker. Finally, the mathematical and experimental results exhibit high accuracy and detection rate than the existing methodologies. The novelty of this approach strengthens the security of the SDN paradigm of cloud resources by redefining conventional access control policy.",Cloud-Based Zero Trust Access Control Policy: An Approach to Support Work-From-Home Driven by COVID-19 Pandemic
"Background: The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) in Canada’s capital city is the tertiary cancer care center for the Baffin Island area of Nunavut- a Territory located in Canada’s north accessed by a 3-hour flight The Inuit of Canada’s north have dramatically higher social and economic inequities compared to mainstream Canada (ITK, 2018) [GB1] [CR2] [CR3] For example, 70% of Nunavut Inuit households experience food insecurities compared to 8% of the remainder of Canada 63% of adult Inuit smoke compared to 16% of mainstream Canada Approximately 30% of Inuit living in Nunavut diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2010 did not access any cancer services (Asmis, 2016) Method: Building productive relationships is one of the key pillars of our organization’s cancer strategy This is demonstrated by the efforts that have taken place among key partners including: 1) TOH’s interdisciplinary teams;2) the Indigenous Cancer Control Unit of Cancer Care Ontario (CCO), a provincial agency responsible for addressing the cancer burden of First Nations, Inuit and Metis (FNIM) peoples;3) the Qikiqtani General Hospital (QGH) in Nunavut, providing inpatient and ambulatory care in the Baffin Island and 4) Ottawa-based Inuit service provider organizations Results: The collaborative relationship developed among the multiple partners resulted in the following positive outcomes: The establishment of a ‘Relationship Table’ where Inuit service provider stakeholders in Ottawa and Nunavut meet quarterly to review cancer related issues and to provide advice on service delivery challenges The Table is grounded in a formalized relationship protocol with the Inuit community and organizational leaders Significant increase in the number of patients and family members supported by the Indigenous Cancer Program at TOH Many cases present with very complex physical and psychosocial issues and require extensive and long-term intervention TOH is involved in several research initiatives related to Inuit and cancer care, with the goals of 1) better understanding barriers to accessing cancer care: 2) developing tools to support the patients’ understanding of their illness and prognosis, and 3) encouraging FNIM involvement in shared decision making Over the past year, TOH experts in cancer care have delivered introductory education to health care providers in Nunavut This initial education event led to TOH hosting nine physicians and nurses for a week of onsite training in the Cancer Care environment, thereby solidifying relationships with oncology staff, and enhanced their ability to provide care closer to home for their patients A significant milestone was achieved in September 2020 when the first dose of trastuzumab was delivered in Nunavut This was the first cancer-related medication administered in the Territory, and required education of the QGH Team in the areas of HER2 positive breast cancer assessment, clinical monitoring for toxicity, and administration of sc trastuzumab including relevant symptom/self-management strategies and resources A policy and standard operating procedure for administration, order set, and confirmation of administration documents were finalized and distributed to support the care process These were a collaboration between nursing and pharmacy (both TOH and in the QGH Medical Day Unit) and were vetted by other key stakeholders in Ottawa (breast disease site lead and medical oncology division head) as well as in Nunavut Conclusions: The collaborative effort to provide breast cancer therapy in Nunavut was groundbreaking and lays the foundation to provide treatment for other cancers, such as lung cancer In May 2020, The Ottawa Hospital took the lead in organizing the first ever Oncology conference in Nunavut It was anticipated that approximately 100 health care providers from across Canada and other international locations would be meeting in Iqaluit, Nunavut to discuss models of care and strategies to improve access to care, health outcomes, and overall patient experience with cancer care The outcome o this conference was planned to be shared at the WCLC but due to Covid-19, the conference has been postponed Keywords: Inuit Collaborative Groundbreaking",PL03.06 Improving Outcomes with Immunotherapy: Lessons from Other Diseases
"Creditors often critically shape the fate of bankruptcy reorganizations, yet the drivers and implications of creditors’ reorganization plan confirmations are still not completely understood. Exploring micro-level data on bankruptcy reorganization proceedings in Slovenia, we find that creditors, above all, demand a credible change in the exercise of control rights. The prospects of plan confirmation are positively associated with debt-to-equity conversion as well as those majority ownership changes that occur during the proceeding and feature a domestic incoming owner. In contrast, we find no evidence that plan confirmation is related to management turnover, majority ownership transfers involving a foreign incoming owner, pre-bankruptcy financial indicators other than leverage, the number of creditors, the value of different types of claims, and even the contractual details for the repayment of claims. The incidence of creditor-induced socially costly filtering failures is quite high, with estimates ranging between 41 and 78% based on the ex-post approach and between 40 and 61% based on the ex-ante approach. Confirmations of plans from non-viable businesses are more prevalent than rejections of plans from viable businesses. Our results provide a novel perspective on the creditors’ role in the resolution of business bankruptcy.","Creditors, Plan Confirmations, and Bankruptcy Reorganizations: Lessons from Slovenia"
"Shipping provides essential services even during global pandemics such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The present approach estimates the monetary value at risk (MVR) at the global and regional level for the world fleet and quantifies the amount of averted incident costs due to inspections. It also provides an indication of the effect of COVID-19 on both. This information can help maritime stakeholders to better understand their risk exposure and improve mitigation strategies. The analysis is based on the global fleet, using a comprehensive combination of data. The analysis confirms the importance to estimate all components at ship level, as safety qualities differ, and each vessel benefits differently from an inspection. Estimates of MVR were slightly higher than global insurance premiums with USD 13.7 to 17.8 billion. Over half of the MVR was due to other marine liabilities and hull and machinery, with cruise vessels leading to loss of life and injuries and oil tankers leading to pollution. The top 25 flags accounted for 87.9% of MVR with open registries in the lead. In terms of value of MVR per GRT, traditional flags, Non-IACS flags and owners located in low to upper middle-income countries, showed the highest values. Total MVR decreased by 4.18% due to the effects of the pandemic, but pollution risk exposure increased by 6% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Averted yearly incident costs were estimated to be 25% to 40% of global MVR, which highlights the importance of port state control inspection programs, but as inspection coverage decreased, this translated into a reduction of 6 to 11% of averted incident costs.",Quantification and Analysis of Risk Exposure in the Maritime Industry: Averted Incident Costs Due to Inspections and the Effect of SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19)
"Lonicerae japonicae flos (LJF) is widely used for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). To clarify the anti-inflammatory mechanism of LJF, 29 compounds with high content in LJF were selected for network pharmacology. Then, a comprehensive network pharmacology strategy was implemented, which involved compound-inflammation-target construction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and enrichment analysis. Finally, molecular docking and in vitro experiments were performed to verify the anti-inflammatory activity and targets of the key compound. As a result, 279 inflammation-associated proteins were identified, which are mainly involved in the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the HIF-1 signaling pathway, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. A total of 12 compounds were linked to more than 35 targets, including apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, and ferulic acid. The results of molecular docking showed that AKT has the most binding activity, exhibiting certain binding activity with 10 compounds, including vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, secologanic acid, quercetin, and luteolin; the results of qRT-PCR and WB confirmed that two key compounds, secologanic acid and luteolin, could significantly decrease the secretion of TNF-α and the AKT expression of RAW264.7 murine macrophages stimulated by LPS (lipopolysaccharide). These results demonstrate that the comprehensive strategy can serve as a universal method to illustrate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine by identifying the pathways or targets.",Network Pharmacology-Based Identification of Potential Targets of Lonicerae japonicae Flos Acting on Anti-Inflammatory Effects
"According to most academics, different generations share common characteristics. This undoubtedly helps to better understand their behavior in different scenarios, predicting their responses. However, this seems questionable and that is the main purpose of this study. This research, although preliminary, try to confirm if millennials have common characteristics, or if, on the contrary, there are differences between them due to the culture in which they are immersed. To this end, it has been contextualized in a sector that is very sensitive to cultural differences, such as tourism. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire administered in 2019 via e-mail to young South Korean and Spanish millennials (born 1982–2002). The results suggest that there do not appear to be common personality traits between the countries analyzed. The differences between the two groups for most personality traits and travel motivations were significant.

"Development of a new diagnostic is ideally driven by an understanding of the clinical need that the test addresses and the optimal role the test will have within a care pathway. This survey aimed to understand the clinical need for new sepsis diagnostics and to identify specific clinical scenarios that could be improved by testing. An electronic, cross-sectional survey was circulated to UK National Health Service (NHS) doctors and nurses who care for patients with suspected sepsis in hospitals. Two hundred and sixty-five participants completed the survey, representing 64 NHS Trusts in England. Sixty-seven percent of respondents suggested that the major cause of delay was during the initial identification of sepsis and the subsequent recognition of patients who were deteriorating. Existing blood tests did not enhance the confidence of consultants making their diagnoses. Those surveyed identified a role for a near-patient test to “rule out” suspected sepsis and, thereby, stop or postpone use of antibiotics. Current diagnostic tests are slow, non-specific, and do not reliably identify patients with a high suspicion of sepsis. As a result, they have a limited use in patient management and antibiotic stewardship. Future development of sepsis diagnostics should focus on overcoming these limitations.",The Clinical Need for New Diagnostics in the Identification and Management of Patients with Suspected Sepsis in UK NHS Hospitals: A Survey of Healthcare Professionals

"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is common among children below 5 years. HFMD has a high incidence in Hubei Province, China. In this study, the Prophet model was used to forecast the incidence of HFMD in comparison with the autoregressive-integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and HFMD incidence was decomposed into trends, yearly, weekly seasonality and holiday effect. The Prophet model fitted better than the ARIMA model in daily reported incidence of HFMD. The HFMD incidence forecast by the Prophet model showed that two peaks occurred in 2019, with the higher peak in May and the lower peak in December. Periodically changing patterns of HFMD incidence were observed after decomposing the time-series into its major components. In specific, multi-year variability of HFMD incidence was found, and the slow-down increasing point of HFMD incidence was identified. Relatively high HFMD incidences appeared in May and on Mondays. The effect of Spring Festival on HFMD incidence was much stronger than that of other holidays. This study showed the potential of the Prophet model to detect seasonality in HFMD incidence. Our next goal is to incorporate climate variables into the Prophet model to produce an accurate forecast of HFMD incidence.","Trend analysis and forecast of daily reported incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease in Hubei, China by Prophet model"
"Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing the world today. Environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources have been highlighted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), paving the way for modern concepts such as sustainable growth to be introduced. Therefore, this research explores the relationship between green finance, energy efficiency, and CO(2) emissions in the G7 countries. The study uses panel data model technique to examine the dependence structure of green finance, energy efficiency, and CO(2) emissions. Moreover, we use DEA to construct an energy efficiency index of G7 countries. A specific interval exists between the values of the energy efficiency indexes. Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States were named the most energy-efficient countries in the world, based on results obtained for five consecutive years in this category. However, according to the comparative rankings, France and Italy are the most successful of all the G7 members, followed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Our overall findings of the econometric model confirm the negative impact of green finance and energy efficiency on CO(2) emissions; however, this relationship varies across the different quantiles of the two variables.

"Background Oesophageal pressure (P oes) is used to approximate pleural pressure (P pl) and therefore to estimate transpulmonary pressure (P L). We aimed to compare oesophageal and regional pleural pressures and to calculate transpulmonary pressures in a prospective physiological study on lung transplant recipients during their stay in the intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital. Methods Lung transplant recipients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and monitored by oesophageal manometry and dependent and nondependent pleural catheters were investigated during the post-operative period. We performed simultaneous short-time measurements and recordings of oesophageal manometry and pleural pressures. Expiratory and inspiratory P L were computed by subtracting regional P pl or P oes from airway pressure; inspiratory P L was also calculated with the elastance ratio method. Results 16 patients were included. Among them, 14 were analysed. Oesophageal pressures correlated with dependent and nondependent pleural pressures during expiration (R2=0.71, p=0.005 and R2=0.77, p=0.001, respectively) and during inspiration (R2=0.66 for both, p=0.01 and p=0.014, respectively). P L values calculated using P oes were close to those obtained from the dependent pleural catheter but higher than those obtained from the nondependent pleural catheter both during expiration and inspiration. Conclusions In ventilated lung transplant recipients, oesophageal manometry is well correlated with pleural pressure. The absolute value of P oes is higher than P pl of nondependent lung regions and could therefore underestimate the highest level of lung stress in those at high risk of overinflation.",Oesophageal pressure as a surrogate of pleural pressure in mechanically ventilated patients.

"Food waste, among the organic wastes, is one of the most promising substrates to be used as a renewable resource. Wide availability of food waste and the high greenhouse gas impacts derived from its inappropriate disposal, boost research through food waste valorization. Several innovative technologies are applied nowadays, mainly focused on bioenergy and bioresource recovery, within a circular economy approach. Nevertheless, food waste treatment should be evaluated in terms of sustainability and considering the availability of an optimized separate collection and a suitable treatment facility. Anaerobic codigestion of waste-activated sludge with food waste is a way to fully utilize available anaerobic digestion plants, increasing biogas production, energy, and nutrient recovery and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Codigestion implementation in Europe is explored and discussed in this paper, taking into account different food waste collection approaches in relation to anaerobic digestion treatment and confirming the sustainability of the anaerobic process based on case studies.

Esta nota de campo pretende describir una experiencia de aplicación del análisis de género al impacto de la pandemia sobre la salud de la población, realizado por el alumnado y el profesorado del Diploma de Género y Salud de la Escuela Andaluza de Salud Pública-Universidad de Granada. La actividad consistió en realizar una revisión de la literatura sobre los cuidados y su impacto en la salud en el contexto de crisis sanitaria, un análisis de género de la información y una reflexión y un debate compartidos. El debate se agrupó en torno a cinco reflexiones, en las que los cuidados se situaron en el centro. Cada reflexión se ligó a la necesidad de incorporar el enfoque de género en medidas y actuaciones concretas.",Cuidados y abordaje de la pandemia de COVID-19 con enfoque de género
"Culling is used in traditional public health policies to control animal populations. These policies aim primarily to protect human interests but often fail to provide scientific evidence of effectiveness. In this article, we defend the need to move from a strictly anthropocentric approach to disease control towards a One Health ethics, using culling practices as an example. We focus on the recent badger culls in the UK, claiming that, based on data provided by the English Government, these culls may be unjustified, all thing considered. We highlight the relevance of ethical reasoning rooted in One Health for this discussion, and make several suggestions including a moratorium on culling until data are provided to support the effectiveness of culling; to conduct a randomized trial to compare proactive culling with alternative methods; to apply deliberative democratic methods to assess public opinion towards the culls, and to find in Brexit an opportunity for aiming for more effective control measures.",Stamping Out Animal Culling: From Anthropocentrism to One Health Ethics
"Rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody has become part of the standard therapy for patients with CD20-expressing B-cell lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis. After encouraging results with open studies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), RTX has not shown its effectiveness in randomized controlled trials. However, its efficacy has been validated in renal, hematological, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the history of RTX in SLE would be instructive in the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) saga in COVID-19. Three steps would be necessary and sufficient before definitively closing the debate: 1) determine the effective and safe dose of HCQ, as well as the minimum duration of treatment in COVID-19; 2) define the profile of patients in whom HCQ would be more likely to be effective (especially in asymptomatic patients and/or at the onset of the first signs of the disease) and 3) conduct one or more multicentre RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19 in SSA.",Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19: can we learn from the use of rituximab in systemic lupus erythematosus?
Munculnya berbagai penyakit yang sering menyerang anak usia sekolah umumnya berkaitan dengan pemahaman anak tentang apa itu hidup bersih dan sehat serta penerapan perilaku hidup bersih dan sehatan (PHBS) dan pemahaman anak tentang apa itu hidup bersih dan sehat. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat hubungan antara pengetahuan dan PHBS anak sekolah dasar terhadap kejadian sakit yang di alami di masa pandemi COVID-19 ini. Pendekatan kuantitatif dengan rancangan studi potong lintang dilakukan dengan melibatkan 58 anak sekolah dasar yang berada di wilayah perkotaan dan pedesaan Kabupaten Banyumas. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan sebagian besar siswa memiliki pengetahuan tentang gizi dan kesehatan yang masih rendah (621%) meski demikian siswa yang menerapkan PHBS dengan baik sudah lebih banyak (638%). Uji chi-square antara pengetahuan siswa dengan kejadian sakit diperoleh nilai p=0.051 dan antara penerapan PHBS siswa dengan kejadian sakit nilai p = 0.478. Dapat disimpulkan bahwa tidak ada hubungan yang signifikan antara pengetahuan dan PHBS terhadap kejadian sakit anak sekolah dasar di wilayah perkotaan dan pedesaan Kabupaten Banyumas. Kata kunci: Anak Sekolah Dasar Perilaku Hidup Bersih dan Sehat Pedesaan.Various diseases that often attack school-age children are generally related to children’s understanding of what clean and healthy living is as well as the application of clean and healthy living habits (PHBS) and children’s understanding of what clean and healthy living is. This study aims to see the relationship between knowledge and PHBS of elementary school children on the incidence of illness during the pandemic of COVID-19. A quantitative approach with a cross-sectional study design was carried out involving 58 elementary school children in urban and rural areas of Banyumas Regency. The results showed that most students had low knowledge of nutrition and health (62.1%) however there were already more students who had implemented PHBS properly (63.8%). Chi-square test between students’ knowledge and the incidence of illness obtained p value = 0.051 and between the application of students PHBS and the incidence of illness p = 0.478. It can be concluded that there is no significant relationship between knowledge and PHBS on the incidence of illness in primary school children in urban and rural areas of Banyumas Regency.

"This study aimed at determining the magnitude of stress among COVID 19 health workers in Kabwe district. METHODS The study was a cross-sectional study which recruited 138 health care workers managing COVID 19 cases in Kabwe. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 while qualitative data was analyzed using Nvivo8. RESULTS The study obtained 100% responses from the respondents and the prevalence of stress among the respondents was 73%. The nurses were more perceived to experience stress compared to the pharmacy personnel (28% vs. 3%). Similarly, women displayed a higher likelihood of experiencing stress compared to men. Lack of support, increased workload and fear were among the factors leading to stress. CONCLUSION The study went out to determine stress among healthcare workers in Kabwe district. It was established that nurses were more vulnerable than groups. And women were found to be more stressed than men. It is therefore recommended that effective and meaningful interventions be put in place to mitigate the impact of long-term psychological distress and physical well-being in healthcare workers during the COVID 19 pandemic and future outbreaks.",PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF STRESS AMONG COVID 19 HEALTH WORKERS IN KABWE DISTRICT: A CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY
"The relationship between parasite virulence and transmission is a pillar of evolutionary theory that has implications for public health. Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host–parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships—Theoretical or empirical in nature—Tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission being a secondary consideration. Even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence–survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence–survival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including R(0), and on the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as the evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence may have considerably different epidemiological signatures.",The Epidemiological Signature of Pathogen Populations That Vary in the Relationship between Free-Living Parasite Survival and Virulence
"Objective To investigate the effect of zinc finger protein A20 on lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration in rabbits. Methods Twenty-six 3-month-old New Zealand rabbits, 2.0-2.5 kg in weight, were used to establish the model of intervertebral disc degeneration at L 3, 4, L 4, 5, and L 5, 6 by transabdominal needle puncture. At 4 weeks after operation, the 24 rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups after successful modeling, which checked by MRI. The target intervertebral discs of each group were injected with zinc finger protein A20 overexpressed adenovirus (Ov-A20 group), empty carrier adenovirus (NC group), phosphate buffer saline (control group), and shRNA-A20 adenovirus (Sh-A20 group). The biological responses of animals in each group were comprehensive scored before 1 day of injection and after 1, 2, 3, and 6 days of injection. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection, the animals in each group were observed by MRI to obtain the exact T2 relaxation time (T2 signal value). After MRI examination, the animals were killed to take the degenerative intervertebral disc tissue; and the tissue was detected by Alcian blue staining to observed the intervertebral disc degeneration. The expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen Ⅱ, and aggrecan were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. The expressions of zinc finger protein A20, nuclear factor κB binding protein [P65, phosphate P65 (P-P65), collagen Ⅱ, aggrecan], inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β)], autophagy-related protein [LC3 (LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ) and P62] were detected by Western blot. Results The comprehensive score of biological response in each group after injection was significantly lower than that before injection ( P<0.05). At 6 days after injection, the comprehensive score of biological response in the Sh-A20 group was significantly lower than that in other groups ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference among other groups ( P>0.05). The detection of MRI showed that the T2 signal value in the Ov-A20 group was the highest at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection ( P<0.05), and the T2 signal value in the Sh-A20 group was the lowest at 2 and 4 weeks after injection ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference between other groups ( P>0.05). Alcian blue staining showed that the expression of aggrecan was the highest in Ov-A20 group and the lowest in Sh-A20 group at 4 weeks ( P<0.05); the expression of aggrecan in Ov-A20 group was the highest at 8 weeks ( P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between other groups ( P>0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen Ⅱ, and aggrecan were the highest in Ov-A20 group and lowest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05). Western blot showed that the expressions of zinc finger protein A20, collagen Ⅱ, aggrecan, and LC3 (LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ) proteins were the highest in the Ov-A20 group and the lowest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05), while the expressions of P-P65, TNF-α, IL-1β, and P62 proteins were the lowest in Ov-A20 group and the highest in Sh-A20 group ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of p65 protein between groups ( P>0.05). Conclusion Zinc finger protein A20 can effectively regulate the process of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration in rabbits by inhibiting inflammation.",[Experimental study on the effect of zinc finger protein A20 on lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration in rabbits].
"BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the outcome and morbidity parameters of laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair for recurrent and primary inguinal hernias. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted over a 3-year period. The recurrence rate; pain scores at 24 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks; hospital stay; days to resumption of normal activities; seroma formation; and urinary retention rates were noted. RESULTS Of 937 patients, 52 underwent recurrent and 885 underwent primary hernia repair. The follow-up period was 12 to 40 months (median, 25 months). The mean operating time was longer in the recurrent group (32.7 +/- 6.3 min) than in the primary group (30.1 +/- 6.1 min; p = 0.015). The mean pain scores at 24 h were similar in the two groups (2.28 +/- 0.5 for the recurrent group vs. 2.20 +/- 0.4 for the primary group; nonsignificant difference). However the pain scores at 1 week were significantly higher in the recurrent group (1.35 +/- 0.5) than in the primary group (1.20 +/- 0.4; p = 0.017). The hospital stay (1.19 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.07 +/- 0.3 days; p = 0.002) and the time to resumption of normal activities (8.62 +/- 2.6 vs. 7.67 +/- 1.4 days; p < 0.0001) were significantly longer in the recurrent group than in the primary group. The urinary retention (9.6% vs. 5.4%; nonsignificant difference) and seroma formation (3.8% vs. 3.5%; p = 0.5) were similar in the recurrent and the primary groups, respectively. There were two recurrences and two conversions to open procedure in the primary group and none in the recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TEP repair of recurrent inguinal hernia is safe and effective, with recurrence and conversion rates similar to those for primary hernia repair. However, the operative time, pain at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively, hospital stay, and time to resumption of normal activities with recurrent repair were significantly greater than with laparoscopic primary hernia repair.",Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair of recurrent inguinal hernias.

"INTRODUCTION: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disease characterized by hepatic venous flow obstruction. The obstruction may be thrombotic or non-thrombotic anywhere along the venous course from the hepatic venules to the inferior vena cava (IVC) junction to the right atrium. In clinical practice, cases can be misdiagnosed, particularly in regions where resources are limited, unless the clinician pays special attention to such diagnosis. CASE REPORT AND CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Here, we would like to present a misdiagnosed case of Budd Chiari syndrome. This reported case is a case of 30 years old female patient complaining of dull abdominal pain and swelling. Initially, the patient consulted a local health facility where the patient was diagnosed with tuberculous peritonitis and subsequently treated with an anti-TB regimen empirically. Within a few days of taking medicine, she developed mild jaundice and lower limb edema. At this stage, the patient came to us, which after taking history, her physical examination unveiled mild jaundice, ascites, abdominal tenderness, and mild lower limb petting edema. The patient was recommended an abdominal CT scan with contrast, which revealed early enhancement and enlargement of the caudate lobe and non-opacification of hepatic veins with narrowing of the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava consistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome. The patient was started on warfarin and referred for a hepatic decongestive procedure. After four months of performing a transjugular portosystemic shunt, the patient came to us for follow-up. She had an excellent clinical improvement and was started on rivaroxaban 20 mg daily orally. CONCLUSION: The main takeaway lesson of this particular case is to consider the differential diagnosis of ascites from an etiologic point of view and not to overemphasize a single etiology.","Misdiagnosis of Budd Chiari syndrome, a case report from Afghanistan"
"Transcending the binary categorization of racist and xenophobic texts, this research takes cues from social science theories to develop a four-dimensional category for racism and xenophobia detection, namely stigmatization, offensiveness, blame, and exclusion. With the aid of deep learning techniques, this categorical detection enables insights into the nuances of emergent topics reflected in racist and xenophobic expression on Twitter. Moreover, a stage wise analysis is applied to capture the dynamic changes of the topics across the stages of early development of Covid-19 from a domestic epidemic to an international public health emergency, and later to a global pandemic. The main contributions of this research include, first the methodological advancement. By bridging the state-of-the-art computational methods with social science perspective, this research provides a meaningful approach for future research to gain insight into the underlying subtlety of racist and xenophobic discussion on digital platforms. Second, by enabling a more accurate comprehension and even prediction of public opinions and actions, this research paves the way for the enactment of effective intervention policies to combat racist crimes and social exclusion under Covid-19. © 2021 IEEE.",Beyond a binary of (non)racist tweets: A four-dimensional categorical detection and analysis of racist and xenophobic opinions on Twitter in early Covid-19
"BACKGROUND: The protective efficacy of avian influenza virus (AIV) vaccines is unsatisfactory due to the presence of various serotypes generated by genetic reassortment. Thus, immunization with a polyantigen chimeric epitope vaccine may be an effective strategy for protecting poultry from infection with different AIV subtypes. METHODS: Baculovirus has recently emerged as a novel and attractive gene delivery vehicle for animal cells. In the present study, a recombinant baculovirus BmNPV-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT containing a fused codon-optimized sequence (CTLT) of T lymphocyte epitopes from H1HA, H9HA, and H7HA AIV subtypes, and another fused codon-optimized sequence (THB) of Th and B cell epitopes from H1HA, H9HA, and H7HA AIV subtypes, driven by a baculovirus P10 promoter and cytomegalovirus CMV promoter, respectively, was constructed. RESULTS: Western blotting and cellular immunofluorescence demonstrated that the CTLT (THB) can be expressed in rBac-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT-infected silkworm cells (mammalian HEK293T cells). Furthermore, the recombinant virus, rBac-CMV-THB-CTLT, was used to immunize both chickens and mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results of an indirect ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and T lymphocyte proliferation assay indicated that specific humoral and cellular responses were detected in both chicken and mice. These results suggest that rBac-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT can be developed as a potential vaccine against different AIV subtypes.",AIV polyantigen epitope expressed by recombinant baculovirus induces a systemic immune response in chicken and mouse models

"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Breast abscess is a common problem in breastfeeding women. However, septic shock secondary to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from breast abscess is very rare. Successful management of this condition in our center may provide experience of treatment for similar patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old breastfeeding woman with breast abscess was transferred to our center. General condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly to life-threatening septic shock. Culture of pus later demonstrated MRSA infection, with vancomycin susceptibility. Several measures were emergently implemented, including removal of necrotic tissue, continuous catheter irrigation and drainage, intravenous infusion of vancomycin, pumping norepinephrine, fluid resuscitation and transfusion of plasma. The patient was cured and discharged after 10 day's treatment. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Life-threatening septic shock secondary to MRSA in breastfeeding women with breast abscess is very rare. Nevertheless, clinicians should remain vigilant to early symptoms and signs of septic shock. Catheter irrigation and drainage, vancomycin and fluid resuscitation are essential for septic shock in lactational breast abscess. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of the diagnosis and management of life-threatening septic shock secondary to MRSA in breast abscess to help us further understand this rare and fatal disease.",Management of life-threatening staphylococcal septic shock in a breastfeeding woman with breast abscess: A case report

"This research explores the impact of environment, life expectancy, and real GDP per capita on health expenditures in a sample of 27 EU member states over the 2000–2018 period through causality and cointegration analyses. The causality analysis revealed a significant unilateral causality from variables of greenhouse gas emissions, life expectancy, and real GDP per capita to health expenditures. In other words, greenhouse gas emissions, life expectancy, and real GDP per capita had a significant impact on health expenditures in the short run. The cointegration analysis indicated that life expectancy and real GDP per capita had a significant positive impact on health expenditures at the overall panel. On the other side, the country level cointegration coefficients revealed that life expectancy had a considerable positive impact on health expenditures, real GDP per capita had a moderate positive impact on the health expenditures in most of the countries in the panel, but the environment proxied by greenhouse gas emissions had a low positive or negative impact on the health expenditures in a limited number of countries.","Impact of Environment, Life Expectancy and Real GDP per Capita on Health Expenditures: Evidence from the EU Member States"
"Piscine reovirus (PRV) is the causative agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), which is detrimental to Atlantic Salmon (AS) aquaculture, but so far has not been cultivatable, which impedes studying the disease and developing a vaccine. Homogenates of head kidney and red blood cells (RBC) from AS in which PRV-1 had been detected were applied to fish cell lines. The cell lines were from embryos, and from brain, blood, fin, gill, gonads, gut, heart, kidney, liver, skin, and spleen, and had the shapes of endothelial, epithelial, fibroblast, and macrophage cells. Most cell lines were derived from the Neopterygii subclass of fish, but one was from subclass Chondrostei. Cultures were examined by phase contrast microscopy for appearance, and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for PRV-1 RNA amplification and for the capacity to transfer any changes to new cultures. No changes in appearance and Ct values were observed consistently or transferable to new cultures. Therefore, 31 cell lines examined were unable to support PRV-1 amplification and are described as belonging to the non-supportive PRV-1 invitrome. However, these investigations and cell lines can contribute to understanding PRV-1 cellular and host tropism, and the interactions between virus-infected and bystander cells.",Screening of Fish Cell Lines for Piscine Orthoreovirus-1 (PRV-1) Amplification: Identification of the Non-Supportive PRV-1 Invitrome
"OBJECTIVE This research attempts a differential diagnosis of skeletal lesions in a commingled sample from Hisban, Jordan, focusing on non-adults in the assemblage. MATERIALS 2,883 well-preserved skeletal elements and 9 relatively complete skulls representing an MNI of 32 non-adults (<18 years old). METHODS All skeletal elements were observed macroscopically and pathophysiological processes underlying any lesions or other anomalies were assessed, followed by a comparative approach to rule out potential diagnoses. RESULTS The skeletal lesions observed were caused by inflammation due to chronic hemorrhaging, marrow hyperplasia due to an increase in hemopoiesis, rapid bone growth, and the impact of biomechanical strain on poorly mineralized elements. Rickets, scurvy, and acquired anemias best fit this pattern of lesions, although inflammation from other sources such as trauma or infection could not be definitively ruled out. CONCLUSIONS The in utero and postnatal environments at Hisban were conducive to the development of vitamin C and D deficiencies from birth until 2 years of age. The analysis of commingled remains requires an ontological shift in the importance of the individual to the population in paleopathology. SIGNIFICANCE This investigation demonstrates the efficacy of a combined biological and comparative approach in differential diagnosis in complicated commingled collections. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of the mother-infant dyad in understanding metabolic disease. LIMITATIONS Histological and radiographic analyses were not included in this diagnostic study due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH Isotopic analysis to investigate childhood diet and histological and radiographic analyses to assess survival of deficiencies.","Differential diagnosis of metabolic disease in a commingled sample from 19th century Hisban, Jordan."

"OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this study are to determine efficacy of Siddha medicine, Kabasura kudineer in reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and reducing the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic COVID-19 when compared to Vitamin C and Zinc (CZ) supplementation. In addition, the trial will examine the changes in the immunological markers of the Siddha medicine against control. The secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety of the Siddha medicine and to document clinical profile of asymptomatic COVID-19 as per principles of Siddha system of Medicine. TRIAL DESIGN: A single centre, open-label, parallel group (1:1 allocation ratio), exploratory randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Cases admitted at non-hospital settings designated as COVID Care Centre and managed by the State Government Stanley Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India will be recruited. Eligible participants will be those tested positive for COVID-19 by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) aged 18 to 55 years without any symptoms and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and bronchial asthma. Those pregnant or lactating, with severe respiratory disease, already participating in COVID trials and with severe illness like malignancy will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Adopting traditional methods, decoction of Kabasura kudineer will be prepared by boiling 5g of KSK powder in 240 ml water and reduced to one-fourth (60ml) and filtered. The KSK group will receive a dose of 60ml decoction, orally in the morning and evening after food for 14 days. The control group will receive Vitamin C (60000 IU) and Zinc tablets (100mg) orally in the morning and evening respectively for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 load [as measured by cyclic threshold (CT) value of RT-PCR] from the baseline to that of seventh day of the treatment, prevention of progression of asymptomatic to symptomatic state (clinical symptoms like fever, cough and breathlessness) and changes in the immunity markers [Interleukins (IL) 6, IL10, IL2, Interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha]. Clinical assessment of COVID-19 as per standard Siddha system of medicine principles and the occurrence of adverse effects will be documented as secondary outcomes.

"COVID-19 or novel coronavirus disease, which has already been declared as a worldwide pandemic, at first had an outbreak in a large city of China, named Wuhan. More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general seasonal flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. As there are no distinctive COVID-19 positive case detection tools available, the need for supporting diagnostic tools has increased. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them, a critical approach for treatment is radiologic imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful in the accurate identification of this disease, and can also be supportive in overcoming the issue of a shortage of trained physicians in remote communities. In this article, we have introduced a VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group, also called OxfordNet) Network-based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R–CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using an available open-source dataset.

Therefore, we believe this proposed method might be of assistance for health professionals to validate their initial assessment towards COVID-19 patients.",COVID faster R–CNN: A novel framework to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in X-Ray images
"Fermented soybean products are traditionally consumed and popular in many Asian countries and the northeastern part of India To search for potential agents for the interruption of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein 1 (S1) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interactions, the in silico antiviral prospective of peptides identified from the proteome of kinema was investigated Soybean was fermented using Bacillus licheniformis KN1G, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KN2G and two different strains of Bacillus subtilis (KN2B and KN2M) The peptides were screened in silico for possible antiviral activity using two different web servers (AVPpred and meta-iAVP), and binding interactions of selected 44 peptides were further explored against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein (PDB ID: 6M0J) by molecular docking using ZDOCK The results showed that a peptide ALPEEVIQHTFNLKSQ (P13) belonging to B licheniformis KN1G fermented kinema was able to make contacts with the binding motif of RBD by blocking specific residues designated as critical (GLN493, ASN501) in the binding of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor The selected peptide was also observed to have a significant affinity towards human toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD2) (PDB ID: 3FXI) complex known for its essential role in cytokine storm The energy properties of the docked complexes were analyzed through the Generalized Born model and Solvent Accessibility method (MM/GBSA) using HawkDock server The results showed peptidyl amino acids GLU5, GLN8, PHE11, and LEU13 contributed most to P13-RBD binding Similarly, ARG90, PHE121, LEU61, PHE126, and ILE94 were appeared to be significant in P13-TLR4/MD2 complex The findings of the study suggest that the peptides from fermented soy prepared using B licheniformis KN1G have better potential to be used as antiviral agents The specific peptide ALPEEVIQHTFNLKSQ could be synthesized and used in combination with experimental studies to validate its effect on SARS-CoV-2-hACE2 interaction and modulation of TLR4 activity Subsequently, the protein hydrolysate comprising these peptides could be used as prophylaxis against viral diseases, including COVID-19",A Multifunctional Peptide From Bacillus Fermented Soybean for Effective Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1 Receptor Binding Domain and Modulation of Toll Like Receptor 4: A Molecular Docking Study
"PROPOSE: In this study, we re-assessed the criteria defined by the radiological society of north America (RSNA) to determine novel radiological findings helping the physicians differentiating COVID-19 and pulmonary contusion. METHODS: All trauma patients with blunt chest wall trauma and subsequent pulmonary contusion, COVID-19-related signs and symptoms before the trauma were enrolled in this retrospective study from February to May 2020. Included patients (Group P) were then classified into two groups based on polymerase chain reaction tests (Group Pa for positive patients and Pb for negative ones). Moreover, 44 patients from the pre-pandemic period (Group PP) were enrolled. They were matched to group P regarding age, sex, and trauma-related scores. Two radiologists blindly reviewed the CT images of all enrolled patients according to criteria defined by the RSNA criteria. The radiological findings were compared between group P and PP; statistically significant ones were re-evaluated between Pa and Pb thereafter. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of each significant findings were calculated. The Chi-square test was used to compare the radiological findings between two groups. RESULTS: In the group PP, 73.7% of all ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and 80% of all multiple bilateral GGOs were detected (p < 0.001 and p = 0.25, respectively). Single bilateral GGOs were only seen among the group PP. The Chi-square tests showed that the prevalence of diffused GGOs, multiple unilateral GGOs, multiple consolidations, and multiple bilateral consolidations were significantly higher in the group P (p = 0.001, 0.01, 0.003, and 0.003, respectively). However, GGOs with irregular borders and single consolidations were more significant among the group PP (p = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively). Of note, reticular distortions and subpleural spares were exclusively detected in the group PP. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the criteria set by RSNA for the diagnosis of COVID-19 are not appropriate in trauma patients. The clinical signs and symptoms are not always useful either. The presence of multiple unilateral GGOs, diffused GGOs, and multiple bilateral consolidations favor COVID-19 with 88%, 97.62%, and 77.7% diagnostic accuracy.",Comparison of chest CT scan findings between COVID-19 and pulmonary contusion in trauma patients based on RSNA criteria: Established novel criteria for trauma victims
"INTRODUCTION: Training in care for sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations is critical for ending the HIV epidemic. SGM people, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, experience disproportionate HIV infection across the globe. The objective of this commentary was to synthesize facilitators of and barriers to SGM health training efforts for healthcare workers in Uganda, in order to help inform potential priorities, strategies and next steps to advance culturally responsive HIV‐related care for SGM communities across Uganda and sub‐Saharan Africa. DISCUSSION: SGM health training often includes education on: foundational concepts and language; stigma, discrimination and SGM health disparities; understanding and addressing implicit bias; sensitive and effective communication and building SGM‐inclusive and welcoming healthcare environments. Clinicians’ education includes sexual and gender histories, sex‐positive HIV counselling, sexually transmitted infections, HIV pre‐exposure prophylaxis and gender‐affirming hormone therapy. SGM communities in sub‐Saharan Africa have often experienced discrimination, persecution, incarceration and physical violence, and they encounter unique barriers to engagement in sexual health services and HIV prevention and treatment. SGM health training efforts in Uganda reveal challenges to and opportunities for advancing equity for SGM communities in sexual health and HIV medical care across the region. In Uganda, SGM community advocacy, as well as policies and programmes of the Ministry of Health and US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, have increased readiness and need for scaling up training and skills‐sharing in SGM‐focused HIV and sexual healthcare, including Ugandan‐led and international initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous challenges exist to widespread culturally responsive HIV and sexual healthcare for SGM communities in sub‐Saharan Africa. Lessons learned from healthcare worker training efforts in Uganda may inform future replication, adaptation and dissemination initiatives to meet the needs of more SGM communities in the region. Evaluation of SGM health training programmes to determine the impact on HIV virological suppression and sexual health outcomes will be critical for identifying best practices and strategies that may support advancing HIV epidemic control for SGM communities in Uganda and across sub‐Saharan Africa.",Healthcare worker training to improve quality of care for sexual and gender minority people in sub‐Saharan Africa: learning from efforts in Uganda
"Cloud computing enables remote execution of users tasks. The pervasive adoption of cloud computing in smart cities services and applications requires timely execution of tasks adhering to Quality of Services (QoS). However, the increasing use of computing servers exacerbates the issues of high energy consumption, operating costs, and environmental pollution. Maximizing the performance and minimizing the energy in a cloud data center is challenging. In this paper, we propose a performance and energy optimization bi-objective algorithm to tradeoff the contradicting performance and energy objectives. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is for the first time proposed using system performance counters. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a realistic cloud dataset in a cloud computing environment. Our experimental results achieve higher performance and lower energy consumption compared to a state of the art algorithm.",Performance and Energy-Aware Bi-objective Tasks Scheduling for Cloud Data Centers
"Background: The vast variation in COVID 19 mortality across the globe draws attention to potential risk factors other than the patient characteristics that determine COVID-19 mortality. Subjects and Methods: We have quantified and analyzed one of the broadest set of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death, ranging from disease related co-morbities, socioeconomic factors, healthcare capacity and government policy and interventions. Data for population, total cases, total COVID mortality, tests done, and GDP per capita were extracted from the worldometers database. Datasets for health expenditure by government, hospital beds, rural population, prevalence of smoking, prevalence of overweight population, deaths due to communicable disease and incidence of malaria were extracted from the World Bank website. Prevalence of diabetes was retrieved from the indexmundi rankings. The average population age, 60+ population, delay in lockdown, population density and BCG data were also included for analysis. The COVID-19 mortality per million and its associated factors were retrieved for 56 countries across the globe. Quantitative analysis was done at the global as well as continent level. All the countries included in the study were categorized continent and region wise for comparative analysis determining the correlation between COVID 19 mortality and the aforementioned factors. Results: There was significant association found between mortality per million and 60+ population of country, average age, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and case fatality rate with correlation and p value (p) of 0.422 (p 0.009), 0.386 (p 0.0186), -0.384 (p 0.019) and 0.753 (p 0.000) respectively at 95% CI. Conclusion: The study observations will serve as a evidence based management strategy for generating predictive model for COVID-19 infection and mortality rate.",A comparative analysis of COVID-19 mortality rate across the globe: An extensive analysis of the associated factors
"COVID-19 has spread all over the world, accounting for countless death and enormous economic loss. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, governments from different countries have made various policies to prevent the pandemic from becoming worse. However, civilian reactions to the pandemic vary when they face similar situations. This behavioral variation creates a challenge when it comes to policy-making. Such differences are generally implicit, hidden in ones' social lives. As a result, it is challenging to analyze such differences when the governments make policies. In this work, we investigate social media posts on Twitter and Weibo in order to effectively explore the difference in reactions across various countries, with the aim to understand national differences. To this end, we employ natural language processing (NLP) methods and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tools to process six languages in different countries, including the USA, Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., and China. We provide a comprehensive analysis of public reaction differences from the emotional perspective. Our findings verify that the reactions vary noticeably among various countries for some policies. Therefore, sentiment analysis can significantly influence policy-making. Our work sheds light on the mechanism of detecting the reaction differences in various countries, which can be utilized to conduct effective communication and make appropriate policy decisions.",Exploring Public Sentiment During COVID-19: A Cross Country Analysis
"The COVID-19 outbreak is now one of the most critical crises to manage for most of the national healthcare systems in the world. The situation has been complicated by the absence of a vaccine and authorised pharmacological treatments, except for remdesivir. In this context, many medicaments, including different Ebola or HIV antivirals, are used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Authorized medicaments manipulation is sometimes necessary because they are not always formulated to be administered to non-cooperative patients or they are in shortage. It is this the case of the fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, which was extensively used in the first phase of the outbreak inducing a shortage of the oral solution available in the EU market as an oral liquid solution and. Unfortunately, the increased worldwide demand and the reduced goods movements are causing the shortage of the liquid solution. This work provides data on size distribution, osmolarity other than drug chemical stability of a lopinavir/ritonavir extemporaneous preparation prepared by using as drug source the solid dosage form (i.e., tablet) available on the market. The reported data indicate that such preparation is suitable to be delivered through a nasogastric tube, and enough stable for two weeks from the preparation at room temperature.",Data on compounding lopinavir and ritonavir suspension for non-cooperative COVID-19 patients

"Size expansion can effectively improve tumor accumulation of nanocarriers where precise control is required. A dual-responsive nanocarrier stimulated by both endogenous pH and exogenous heat stimuli can change its size. Herein, a nanoparticle composed of poly(N,N-diethyl acrylamide) (PDEAA) and poly(2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDPA) is developed. The antitumor drug celastrol (CLT) and the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) are then loaded in it to form CIPP. ICG generates heat under near-infrared (NIR) stimulation to kill tumor cells and enhance CIPP penetration. Meanwhile, CIPP expands in response to hyperthermia and acid tumor microenvironments, preventing itself from returning to the blood flow, thus accumulating in tumor sites. Ultimately, the acidic lysosomal environment in tumor cells disintegrates CIPP to release CLT, directly inducing immunogenic cell death and sensitizing tumor cells for hyperthermia by disrupting the interaction of heat shock protein 90 and P50cdc37. Most of the tumors in B16F10-bearing mice are eradicated after single laser irradiation. The dual-responsive CIPP with multiple functions and simple design displays a synergistic antitumor effect. This study provides a basis for developing size-expandable stimulus-responsive drug delivery systems against tumors.",Multifunctional Size-Expandable Nanomedicines Enhance Tumor Accumulation and Penetration for Synergistic Chemo-Photothermal Therapy.
"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare systems worldwide. Although this disease has primarily impacted general medicine intensive care units, other areas of healthcare including psychiatry were modified in response to corona measures to decrease the transmission of the disease. Reflecting on the modifications to the environment provides an opportunity to design psychiatric environments for future pandemics or other demands for healthcare. BACKGROUND: The therapeutic environment of psychiatric wards was modified in Friesland, the Netherlands, in response to COVID-19. During this time, an interdisciplinary team met consistently to contribute to the preliminary design of a new psychiatric hospital. METHODS: During the first 18 months of the pandemic, clinical reflections were made to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the psychiatric care environment. Architects have created a preliminary design of a new psychiatric hospital based on these reflections, monthly collaborative design discussions based on virtual mock-ups and evidence-based design based on theoretical concepts and research. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This theoretical and reflective study describes how an inpatient psychiatric environment was restructured to manage infection during COVID-19. The therapeutic environment of the psychiatric ward and patient care changed drastically during COVID-19. The number of patients accessing care decreased, patient autonomy was restricted, and the function of designated behavioral support spaces changed to manage the risk of infection. However, these challenging times have provided an opportunity to reflect on theories and consider the design of new hospital environments that can be adapted in response to future pandemics or be restructured for different care functions.",The Reorganization of a Psychiatric Unit During COVID-19: A Reflection for Psychiatric Hospital Design
"Providing adequate writing instruction and practice in schools is an essential cornerstone of writing development and it affords a diagnostic approach for teachers. But what writing instruction is being practiced in Australian primary schools? The aim of this study was to survey a sample of teachers (n = 310) about their instructional practices for writing and their preparation and self-efficacy to teach writing. The majority of the teachers surveyed indicated they allocated on average less than three hours per week for writing practice in their classrooms, with findings further showing a large variability in the frequency of writing practice ranging from 15 min to 7.5 h per week. Findings suggested an emphasis placed on teaching foundational skills, such as spelling, over the teaching of process skills, such as planning and revising. Results further indicated that less emphasis is placed on teaching handwriting and typing. The majority of participating teachers reported implementing only six of the 20 different instructional practices included in the survey on a weekly basis, with school-home strategies being the least frequently reported strategies to foster students’ writing development. Most teachers expressed positive beliefs about their preparation and self-efficacy for teaching writing. Results from multiple regression analysis showed that preparation and self-efficacy for teaching writing significantly and statistically accounted for variability in using evidence-based practices, teaching foundational skills, and teaching process skills. However, only self-efficacy made a statically significant contribution to predicting strategies to extend writing to the home environment. Implications for teaching and recommendations for research are provided.",Teaching writing in primary education (grades 1–6) in Australia: a national survey
"The perturbations of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were found to be the main cause of cancer. Previous PPI prediction methods which were trained with non-disease general PPI data were not compatible to map the PPI network in cancer. Therefore, we established a novel cancer specific PPI prediction method dubbed NECARE, which was based on relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) with knowledge-based features. It achieved the best performance with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.84±0.03 and an F1 = 91±2% compared with other methods. With NECARE, we mapped the cancer interactome atlas and revealed that the perturbations of PPIs were enriched on 1362 genes, which were named cancer hub genes. Those genes were found to over-represent with mutations occurring at protein-macromolecules binding interfaces. Furthermore, over 56% of cancer treatment-related genes belonged to hub genes and they were significantly related to the prognosis of 32 types of cancers. Finally, by coimmunoprecipitation, we confirmed that the NECARE prediction method was highly reliable with a 90% accuracy. Overall, we provided the novel network-based cancer protein-protein interaction prediction method and mapped the perturbation of cancer interactome.

"Yeasts, broadly defined as unicellular fungi, fulfill essential roles in soil ecosystems as decomposers and nutrition sources for fellow soil-dwellers. Broad-scale investigations of soil yeasts pose a methodological challenge as metagenomics are of limited use for identifying this group of fungi. Here we characterize global soil yeast diversity using fungal DNA barcoding on 1473 yeasts cultured from 3826 soil samples obtained from nine countries in six continents. We identify mean annual precipitation and international air travel as two significant correlates with soil yeast community structure and composition worldwide. Evidence for anthropogenic influences on soil yeast communities, directly via travel and indirectly via altered rainfall patterns resulting from climate change, is concerning as we found common infectious yeasts frequently distributed in soil in several countries. Our discovery of 41 putative novel species highlights the continued need for culture-based studies to advance our knowledge of environmental yeast diversity.",Global patterns in culturable soil yeast diversity
"The efficiency of the RNA-guided AsCas12a nuclease of Acidaminococcus sp. was compared with SpCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, for functional genomics in Schistosoma mansoni. We deployed optimized conditions for the ratio of guide RNAs to the nuclease, donor templates, and electroporation parameters, to target a key schistosome enzyme termed omega-1. Programmed cleavages catalyzed by Cas12a and Cas9 resulted in staggered- and blunt-ended strand breaks, respectively. AsCas12a was more efficient than SpCas9 for gene knockout, as determined by TIDE analysis. CRISPResso2 analysis confirmed that most mutations were deletions. Knockout efficiency of both nucleases markedly increased in the presence of single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) template. With AsCas12a, ssODNs representative of both the non-CRISPR target (NT) and target (T) strands were tested, resulting in KO efficiencies of 15.67, 28.71, and 21.43% in the SpCas9 plus ssODN, AsCas12a plus NT-ssODN, and AsCas12a plus T-ssODN groups, respectively. Trans-cleavage against the ssODNs by activated AsCas12a was not apparent in vitro. SpCas9 catalyzed more precise transgene insertion, with knock-in efficiencies of 17.07% for the KI_Cas9 group, 14.58% for KI_Cas12a-NT-ssODN, and 12.37% for KI_Cas12a-T-ssODN. Although AsCas12a induced fewer mutations per genome than SpCas9, the phenotypic impact on transcription and expression of omega-1 was similar for both nucleases.","RNA-Guided AsCas12a- and SpCas9-Catalyzed Knockout and Homology Directed Repair of the Omega-1 Locus of the Human Blood Fluke, Schistosoma mansoni"
"This article reviews recent advances and existing challenges for the application of wearable bioelectronics for patient monitoring and domiciliary hospitalization. More specifically, we focus on technical challenges and solutions for the implementation of wearable and conformal bioelectronics for long-term patient biomonitoring and discuss their application on the Internet of medical things (IoMT). We first discuss the general architecture of IoMT systems for domiciliary hospitalization and the three layers of the system, including the sensing, communication, and application layers. In regard to the sensing layer, we focus on current trends, recent advances, and challenges in the implementation of stretchable patches. This includes fabrication strategies and solutions for energy storage and energy harvesting, such as printed batteries and supercapacitors. As a case study, we discuss the application of IoMT for domiciliary hospitalization of COVID 19 patients. This can be used as a strategy to reduce the pressure on the healthcare system, as it allows continuous patient monitoring and reduced physical presence in the hospital, and at the same time enables the collection of large data for posterior analysis. Finally, based on the previous works in the field, we recommend a conceptual IoMT design for wearable monitoring of COVID 19 patients.","Domiciliary Hospitalization through Wearable Biomonitoring Patches: Recent Advances, Technical Challenges, and the Relation to Covid-19"
"Intangibles provide competitive advantages and enhance productivity and efficiency. We investigate whether accumulated intangible assets mitigate the adverse impact of pandemic shocks on corporate performance. Using a sample of 8738 unique U.S. firms during the period 1985–2020, we find that a firm's pre-pandemic intangible assets mitigate the pandemic-induced negative stock price reaction and operating performance. We also show that the resilience to pandemic shocks is driven by both internally generated and externally acquired intangible assets. Finally, we explore related channels, and find that intangible assets-driven corporate resilience to pandemic shocks is explained by positive investor sentiment, customer loyalty, and managerial ability. Importantly, corporate resilience to pandemic shocks emanating from intangibles holds for non-Covid pandemic periods. Overall, our study documents the critical role of intangible assets in safeguarding firms and investors from epidemic- and pandemic-induced shocks.",Do intangible assets provide corporate resilience?

"Income inequality, poverty, and economic growth are defined as an economy's exposure to exogenous shocks arising out of poverty. The study used various econometric estimations to measure the effect of inequality and poverty on economic development during 1990 to 2016 in Vietnam. Various econometric estimation tests confirmed the presence of a long-run association between inequality and poverty, and economic growth is the matter of poverty headcount ratio in Vietnam. When we added the investment-to-GDP ratio and the number of years in education, it decreases by -0.144. This is reduced to -0.05 when log population growth rate was added while the employment, the coefficient decreases to -0.04 and becomes statistically insignificant. We found a negative impact of poverty and we reassess the hypothesis's emphasis on inequality and poverty and their combining effect of inclusive economic growth. Interestingly our results verify the previous findings that inequality and poverty show a negative impact on economic growth. The negative impact of poverty and inequality on economic growth appears to be concentrated at the high poverty level. These findings recommend that poverty reduction policies should be beneficial in encouraging economic growth even if they do not decrease income inequality.",Assessing the Relationship between Poverty and Economic Growth: Does Sustainable Development Goal Can be Achieved?

"BACKGROUND Diabetic neuropathy increases risk of cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, foot amputation and overall mortality. Not only hyperglycaemia induced nerve damage is harder to repair using currently approved medications, but also, the use of these agents is often limited by the extent of pain relief provided and side effects. METHODOLOGY In this prospective, open-label, pilot study, 20 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients (male/female=13/7, mean age- 56.1±8.04 years), meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, were treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Teneligliptin, 20mg once a day for three months. Efficacy parameters: Sudomotor function (Sudoscan score); parasympathetic dysfunction assessed using Ewing's criteria i.e. heart rate response to -standing (HRS), -valsalva (HRV) and -deep breath (HRD); sympathetic dysfunction assessed as blood pressure response to -standing (BPS) and -handgrip (BPH); ankle brachial index (ABI), vibration perception threshold (VPT), C-reactive protein, glycemic profile and health related quality of life (HRQoL); and, tolerability parameters: complete blood count, liver function tests, serum creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone, QT- interval and serum vitamin B12 levels, were measured. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in BMI, SBP, DBP, HRD, BPH and all safety parameters. After 12 weeks treatment, there was improvement in HRS (p<0.01) and HRV (p<0.01), but not in HRD (p=0.12). BPS was significantly lowered (p <0.01), but not the BPH (p =0.06). Sudoscan score was increased, while VPT was significantly decreased (both p<0.01). CONCLUSION Teneligliptin not only improves the glycemic status but also improves sudomotor function, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, and reduces vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes.","Efficacy and tolerability of DPP4 inhibitor, teneligliptin, on autonomic and peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetes: an open label, pilot study."
"OBJECTIVE: Using data from the monthly Current Population Survey, this paper provides monthly employment and unemployment statistics for people with and without disabilities in the United States before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to date (January 2021). DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the Current Population Survey. SETTING: The United States. PARTICIPANTS: People with and without disabilities ages 16-64 years. INTERVENTION: N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage employed, percentage unemployed, percentage not in labor force, percentage on temporary layoff, percentage looking for work. RESULTS: Estimates show that, like workers without disabilities, workers with disabilities experienced increases in unemployment at the beginning of the pandemic but continued to remain engaged in the labor force. Our analysis finds that employment rates dropped from 74.8% to 63.2% for those without disabilities and from 31.1% to 26.4% for those with disabilities between February 2020 and April 2020 but gradually improved in the succeeding months.

"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive professional development model (CPDM) adapted for virtual instruction in its ability to improve self-efficacy related to food literacy and development of remote food literacy education. METHODS: Undergraduate students (n = 12) from two universities participate in a yearlong CPDM. In the first semester, undergraduates attend weekly meetings focused on online learning platforms; building community of practice; reviewing learning models, theories, and pedagogy; and building skills to support social and emotional learning. Undergraduates participate in reflective practice throughout the CPDM to advance their teaching skills. In the second semester, undergraduates develop online modules supporting remote instruction for the learner-centered curriculum Teens CAN: Comprehensive Food Literacy in Cooking, Agriculture, and Nutrition. Undergraduates develop virtual lesson procedures and content to be pilot tested with the community of practice. RESULTS: Upon project conclusion, undergraduates will complete a retrospective questionnaire measuring self-efficacy to teach nutrition. They will also participate in an in-depth interview that mirrors the reflective practice, where they reflect on what they gained and wished to change for future CPDM projects. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing strategies from in-person CPDMs in virtual professional development may provide an efficient, effective, and equitable methodology to connect with undergraduate students and improve their self-efficacy to teach while providing training and skills. This virtual methodology may serve two purposes; decreasing attrition in participation by removing barriers such as travel and scheduling, but also enhancing the delivery of nutrition education through utilization of modern technology. Limitations of remote instruction are numerous, but providing opportunities for undergraduates to develop skills in online education has the potential to broaden the reach of health-focused programming delivered by agencies with limited staff during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Background: The burden of relapsed/refractory childhood cancer takes an immense toll on ill children and their caregivers, jeopardizing quality of life. Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) have shown promising benefits for children with chronic conditions and their families. Little is known about child and caregiver perspectives on AAI participation for children with advanced cancer. Objective: To explore perspectives of children with advanced cancer and their caregivers on experiences with AAIs. Design: Cross-sectional qualitative design. Setting/Subjects: Participants were children (n = 9) aged 5 to 17 years with relapsed or refractory cancer and their parents (n = 12) from one academic children's hospital in the southeastern United States. Participants completed approximately weekly 15-minute AAI sessions with a trained dog and handler during oncology clinic visits or hospitalizations for up to 12 weeks. Measures: Semistructured interviews were carried out after completion of each family's final AAI session to assess child and parent perceptions of AAIs. Qualitative content analysis identified themes. Results: Five themes emerged: (1) positive aspects, (2) negative aspects, (3) preferred changes, (4) pet ownership, and (5) value of the study. Twenty (95%) participants shared positive aspects of AAIs. The only negative aspect reported was too little time with the dog. Conclusion: Children with advanced cancer and their parents perceive AAIs as desirable with few requested changes. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate impact of AAIs.

"The authors’ studies on the organization and variation of plant genome with the use of molecular markers are briefly reviewed with special emphasis on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR), sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR), and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers detected with the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These markers have been demonstrated to be promising for identifying cultivars and determining the purity of genetic strains of pea. Genetic relationships between strains, cultivars, and mutants of pea have been studied. The role of molecular markers in molecular genetic mapping and localizing the genes of commercially important characters of pea has been shown. The possibility of the use of molecular markers for studying somaclonal variation and detecting mutagenic factors in plants during long-term spaceflights is considered. The prospects of using DNA markers for understanding the organization and variability of higher plant genomes are discussed.",Studying plant genome variation using molecular markers
"State space models, including compartmental models, are used to model physical, biological and social phenomena in a broad range of scientific fields. A common way of representing the underlying processes in these models is as a system of stochastic processes which can be simulated forwards in time. Inference of model parameters based on observed time-series data can then be performed using sequential Monte Carlo techniques. However, using these methods for routine inference problems can be made difficult due to various engineering considerations: allowing model design to change in response to new data and ideas, writing model code which is highly performant, and incorporating all of this with up-to-date statistical techniques. Here, we describe a suite of packages in the R programming language designed to streamline the design and deployment of state space models, targeted at infectious disease modellers but suitable for other domains. Users describe their model in a familiar domain-specific language, which is converted into parallelised C++ code. A fast, parallel, reproducible random number generator is then used to run large numbers of model simulations in an efficient manner. We also provide standard inference and prediction routines, though the model simulator can be used directly if these do not meet the user’s needs. These packages provide guarantees on reproducibility and performance, allowing the user to focus on the model itself, rather than the underlying computation. The ability to automatically generate high-performance code that would be tedious and time-consuming to write and verify manually, particularly when adding further structure to compartments, is crucial for infectious disease modellers. Our packages have been critical to the development cycle of our ongoing real-time modelling efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the potential to do the same for models used in a number of different domains.","Reproducible parallel inference and simulation of stochastic state space models using odin, dust, and mcstate"

"Introduction: In the HOSENG trial (NCT03598686), the secondary distribution of oral self-tests for persons absent or refusing to test during a home-based HIV testing campaign in rural Lesotho resulted in an increase in testing coverage of 21% compared to a testing campaign without secondary distribution. This study aims to determine the per patient costs of both HOSENG trial arms. Method: We conducted a micro-costing study to estimate the cost of home-based HIV testing with (HOSENG intervention arm) and without (HOSENG control arm) secondary self-test distribution from a provider's perspective. A mixture of top-down and bottom-up costing was used. We estimated both the financial and economic per patient costs of each possible testing cascade scenario. The costs were adjusted to 2018 US$. Results: The overall provider cost for delivering the home-based HIV testing with secondary distribution was US$36,481 among the 4,174 persons enumerated and 3,094 eligible for testing in the intervention villages compared to US$28,620 for 3,642 persons enumerated and 2,727 eligible for testing in the control. The cost per person eligible for testing was US$11.79 in the intervention vs. US$10.50 in the control. This difference was mainly driven by the cost of distributed oral self-tests. The cost per person tested was, however, lower in intervention villages (US$15.70 vs. US$22.15) due to the higher testing coverage achieved through self-test distribution. The cost per person confirmed new HIV+ was US$889.79 in the intervention and US$753.17 in the control. Conclusion: During home-based HIV testing in Lesotho, the secondary distribution of self-tests for persons absent or refusing to test during the visit reduced the costs per person tested and thus presents a promising add-on for such campaigns.

"Viral infections have haunted humankind since times immemorial. Overpopulation, globalization, and extensive deforestation have created an ideal environment for a viral spread with unknown and multiple shedding routes. Many viruses can infect the male reproductive tract, with potential adverse consequences to male reproductive health, including infertility and cancer. Moreover, some genital tract viral infections can be sexually transmitted, potentially impacting the resulting offspring's health. We have summarized the evidence concerning the presence and adverse effects of the relevant viruses on the reproductive tract (mumps virus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Ebola virus, Zika virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses), their routes of infection, target organs and cells, prevalence and pattern of virus shedding in semen, as well as diagnosis/testing and treatment strategies. The pathophysiological understanding in the male genital tract is essential to assess its clinical impact on male reproductive health and guide future research.",Viral infections and implications for male reproductive health
"The collection of spatiotemporal tourism information is important in smart tourism and user-generated contents are perceived as reliable information. Participatory sensing is a useful method for collecting such data, and the active contribution of users is an important aspect for continuous and efficient data collection. This study has focused on the impact of task allocation interface design and individual personality on data collection efficiency and their contribution in gamified participatory sensing for tourism. We have designed two types of interfaces: a map-based with active selection and a chat-based with passive selection. Moreover, different levels of elaborateness and indirectness have been introduced into the chat-based interface. We have employed the Gamification User Types Hexad framework to identify the differences in the contributions and interface preferences of different user types. The results of our tourism experiment with 108 participants show that the map-based interface collects more data, while the chat-based interface collects data for spots with higher information demand. We also found that the contribution to sensing behavior and interface preference differed depending on the individual user type.",Task allocation interface design and personalization in gamified participatory sensing for tourism
"BACKGROUND: Los Angeles County is a hub for COVID-19 cases in the United States. Academic health centers rapidly deployed and leveraged telemedicine to permit uninterrupted care of patients. Telemedicine enjoys high patient satisfaction, yet little is known about the level of satisfaction during a crisis and to what extent patient- or visit-related factors and trust play when in-person visits are eliminated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine correlates of patients’ satisfaction with a telemedicine visit. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study conducted in our single-institution, urban, academic medical center in Los Angeles, internal medicine patients aged ≥18 years who completed a telemedicine visit between March 10th and April 17th, 2020, were invited for a survey (n=1624). Measures included patient demographics, degree of interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships (using the Trust in Physician Scale), and visit-related concerns. Statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, and linear and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1624 telemedicine visits conducted during this period, 368 (22.7%) patients participated in the survey. Across the study, respondents were very satisfied (173/365, 47.4%) or satisfied (n=129, 35.3%) with their telemedicine visit. Higher physician trust was associated with higher patient satisfaction (Spearman correlation r=0.51, P<.001). Visit-related factors with statistically significant correlation with Trust in Physician score were technical issues with the telemedicine visit (r=–0.16), concerns about privacy (r=–0.19), concerns about cost (r=–0.23), satisfaction with telemedicine convenience (r=0.41), and amount of time spent (r=0.47; all P<.01). Visit-related factors associated with patients’ satisfaction included fewer technical issues (P<.001), less concern about privacy (P<.001) or cost (P=.02), and successful face-to-face video (P<.001). The only patient variable with a significant positive association was income and level of trust in physician (r=0.18, P<.001). Younger age was associated with higher satisfaction with the telemedicine visit (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: There have been calls for redesigning primary care after the COVID-19 pandemic and for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Patients’ satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Their satisfaction is shaped by the degree of trust in physician and visit-related factors more so than patient factors. This has widespread implications for outpatient practices and further research into visit-related factors and the patient-provider connection over telemedicine is needed.",Patient Satisfaction and Trust in Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study

"Increasing attention has been devoted to allosteric modulators as the preferred therapeutic agents for their colossal advantages such as higher selectivity, fewer side effects, and lower toxicity since they bind at allosteric sites that are topographically distinct from the classic orthosteric sites. However, the allosteric binding pockets are not conserved and there are no cogent methods to comprehensively characterize the features of allosteric sites with the binding of modulators. To overcome this limitation, our lab has developed a novel algorithm that can quantitatively characterize the receptor-ligand binding feature named Molecular Complex Characterizing System (MCCS). To illustrate the methodology and application of MCCS, we take G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as an example. First, we summarized and analyzed the reported allosteric binding pockets of class A GPCRs using MCCS. Sequentially, a systematic study was conducted between cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and its allosteric modulators, where we used MCCS to analyze the residue energy contribution and the interaction pattern. Finally, we validated the predicted allosteric binding site in CB2 via MCCS in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our results demonstrate that the MCCS program is advantageous in recapitulating the allosteric regulation pattern of class A GPCRs of the reported pockets as well as in predicting potential allosteric binding pockets. This MCCS program can serve as a valuable tool for the discovery of small-molecule allosteric modulators for class A GPCRs.",Binding Characterization of GPCRs-Modulator by Molecular Complex Characterizing System (MCCS)
"OBJECTIVE To further evaluate the relationship between the clinical profiles and limbic and motor brain regions and their connecting pathways in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Indices (NODDI) multicompartment modeling was used to test the relationships between tissue alterations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple psychiatric symptoms. METHODS The sample included participants with prior TBI (TBI; N = 37) but no PNES, and with TBI and PNES (TBI + PNES; N = 34). Participants completed 3T Siemens Prisma MRI high angular resolution imaging diffusion protocol. Statistical maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), neurite dispersion [orientation dispersion index (ODI)] and density [intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), and free water (i.e., isotropic) volume fraction (V-ISO)] signal intensity, were generated for each participant. Linear mixed-effects models identified clusters of between-group differences in indices of white matter changes. Pearson's r correlation tests assessed any relationship between signal intensity and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS Compared to TBI, TBI + PNES revealed decreases in FA, ICVF, and V-ISO and increases in MD for clusters within cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, fornix/stria terminalis, and corticospinal tract pathways (cluster threshold α = 0.05). Indices of white matter changes for these clusters correlated with depressive, anxiety, PTSD, psychoticism, and somatization symptom severity (FDR threshold α = 0.05). A follow-up within-group analysis revealed that these correlations failed to reach the criteria for significance in the TBI + PNES group alone. INTERPRETATION The results expand support for the hypothesis that alterations in pathways comprising the specific PNES network correspond to patient profiles. These findings implicate myelin-specific changes as possible contributors to PNES, thus introducing novel potential treatment targets.",White matter and neurite morphology differ in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.
"OBJECTIVES: The role of bacteria in acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) of adults and interactions with viral infections is incompletely understood. This study tested the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and illness severity. METHODS: Two groups of 97 specimens each were randomly selected from multiplex-PCR identified virus-positive and virus-negative nasal specimens obtained from adults with new onset ARI, and 40 control specimens were collected from healthy adults. All specimens were analyzed for Haemophilus influenza(HI), Moraxella catarrhalis(MC) and Streptococcus pneumonia(SP) by quantitative-PCR. General linear models tested for relationships between respiratory pathogens, biomarkers (nasal wash neutrophils and CXCL8), and ARI-severity. RESULTS: Nasal specimens from adults with ARIs were more likely to contain bacteria (37% overall; HI=28%, MC=14%, SP=7%) compared to specimens from healthy adults (5% overall; HI=0%, MC=2.5%, SP=2.5%;p<0.001). Among ARI specimens, bacteria were more likely to be detected among virus-negative specimens compared to virus-positive specimens (46% vs. 27%;p=0.0046). The presence of bacteria was significantly associated with increased CXCL8 and neutrophils, but not increased symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic bacteria were more often detected in virus-negative ARI, and also associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers. These findings suggest the possibility that bacteria may augment virus-induced ARI and contribute to airway inflammation. SUMMARY: We tested whether bacterial pathogens were associated with ARI illness and inflammation. Bacteria were detected more often in nasal secretions during ARI, especially in samples without detectable viruses, and were associated with increased airway inflammation, but not increased symptoms.",Detection Of Viral And Bacterial Pathogens In Acute Respiratory Infections

"Introduction The implementation of preventive lockdowns worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered our daily lives. We have observed an increase in vertigo consultations during this period, mainly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Objective To determine the impact of preventive lockdown on the prevalence and characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Methods We did a retrospective study. All patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo during July and August 2020 who visited the clinic in Red de Salud UC Christus, Santiago, Chile, were included. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, need for repositioning maneuvers, and medical history was compared with patients seen in July and August 2019. Cases secondary to trauma and with incomplete records were excluded. Results During July and August 2020, 99 patients consulted with a medical history compatible with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, average age 54.5 years, 68.9% were female. Repositioning maneuvers were required in 40.2% of cases. Of 28 patients with vitamin D levels, 27 showed deficiency/insufficiency. In 2019, for July and August, 54 patients were seen in the clinic with an average age of 61.7 years, and 83.3% were female. Repositioning maneuvers were required in 79.6%, and of the nine patients with vitamin D levels, seven presented deficiency/insufficiency. Statistically significant differences were observed regarding age, sex, and need for repositioning maneuvers. Conclusions A high prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was observed during preventive lockdown for COVID-19 in our clinic. Patients were generally younger, and although it was more frequent in women, the incidence by sex was not as striking as in the previous year.",The impact of COVID-19 preventive lockdowns on the prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
"This paper aims to clarify the role of culture as a public good that serves to preserve mental health. It tests the evolutionary hypothesis that cultural consumption triggers a microeconomic mechanism for the self-defense of mental health from uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a natural experiment of cultural consumption under increased uncertainty. Using primary data from a pilot survey conducted online during the pandemic and applying Probit and Heckman selection models, the study analyzes levels of happiness and propensity to help others. The results suggest that past consumption of culture is associated with higher happiness levels during crises. Moreover, spontaneous cultural practices (such as group singing) during times of uncertainty are associated with an increase in the pro-social propensity to help others. These findings highlight culture as a tool for promoting mental health at the micro level and social capital resilience at the aggregate level.",Culture and mental health resilience in times of COVID-19
"Validation of key analytical and functional performance characteristics of in vitro immunogenicity risk assessment assays increases our confidence in utilizing them for screening biotherapeutics. Herein, we present a fit-for-purpose (FFP) validation of a dendritic cell (DC) activation assay designed to assess the immunogenicity liability of protein biotherapeutics. Characterization of key assay parameters was achieved using monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) treated with cell culture medium only (i.e., background control (BC)), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as system positive control (SPC), and 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with known clinical immunogenicity profiles (bococizumab and TAM163) as therapeutic controls (TCs). In the absence of established validation guidelines for primary cell-based assays, the present DC activation assay was validated using a novel FFP approach which allows more flexibility in selection of validation parameters and designing of experiments based on the intended use of the assay. The present FFP validation allowed us to understand the impact of experimental variables on assay precision, develop a clear concise readout for DC activation results, establish a reliable response threshold to define a result as a positive DC activation response, and define in-study donor acceptance criteria and cohort size. FFP validation of this DC activation assay indicated that the assay is sufficient to support its context of use, a preclinical immunogenicity risk management tool.",Fit-for-Purpose Validation and Establishment of Assay Acceptance and Reporting Criteria of Dendritic Cell Activation Assay Contributing to the Assessment of Immunogenicity Risk.

The research instrument was titled lecturer’s acceptance questionnaire (LAQ) with a calculated Cronbach’s alpha of .919, which confirmed the instrument validity. The gathered data was analysed by using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The formulated hypothesis was tested at .05 level of significance. The result from descriptive analysis of data suggested that behavioural intention was at a low level among lecturers and the results of hypothesis testing revealed the effect of behavioural intention as partial mediator of podcast acceptance. Based on these findings relevant conclusions and recommendations were suggested in this research.",Mediating effect of behavioural intention on podcast acceptance
"AIM Avatrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, can reduce the need for platelet transfusions or rescue interventions for bleeding in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and thrombocytopenia undergoing scheduled procedures. A model analysis indicated that the effect of avatrombopag on platelet production was reduced in East Asian versus non-East Asian patients; however, the difference was deemed not clinically significant. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis of pooled Phase 3 trials showed similar avatrombopag efficacy across racial subgroups. The aim of this Phase 2 study was to corroborate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag in Japanese patients with thrombocytopenia due to CLD. METHODS Japanese patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia were randomized to receive placebo or avatrombopag 20, 40, or 60 mg daily for 5 days. The primary endpoint was responder rate in platelet counts at Visit 4 (10-13 days after treatment initiation), defined as the proportion of patients with platelet count ≥50×109 /L and ≥20×109 /L increase from baseline. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were randomized and completed the study (placebo, n=11; avatrombopag 20 mg, n=7; 40 mg, n=11; 60 mg, n=10). Avatrombopag treatment was associated with significant increases in responder rate at Visit 4 in the 40 mg (63.6%; P=0.004) and 60 mg (40%; P=0.024) groups versus placebo (9.1%). Avatrombopag was well tolerated and no new safety signals were detected. CONCLUSIONS Efficacy and safety results from this study were consistent with previous studies in patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia undergoing elective procedures, supporting treatment with avatrombopag in the Japanese population.

A telephone survey was conducted in May 4-10, 2020 about the Italian lockdown period (March 09th - May 03rd 2020) in a cohort of psoriatic patients treated with biologics, asking about any exposure to COVID-19, disease status, continuation of therapy, work activity and psychological status through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).Results. 226 patients were interviewed, with no COVID-19 positive cases. Sixty-three of 226 (27.9%) described worsening of the disease with a correlation to drug withdrawal [43/226 (19%)]. Correlation was also found between the worsening of psoriasis and HADS anxiety, HADS depression, BRS and PSS abnormal scores considered both as categorical and continuous variables. No correlation was found between worsening of psoriasis and work activity.Conclusion. Uncertainty about whether biologics could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to drug withdrawal with subsequent worsening of psoriasis. Moreover, psychological status also had a direct influence on the clinical course of the disease.",The impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of Italian psoriatic patients treated with biological therapies.
"Nearly every 100 years, humans collectively face a pandemic crisis. After the Spanish flu, now the world is in the grip of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First detected in 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite the initial evidence indicating a zoonotic origin, the contagion is now known to primarily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The precautionary measures recommended by the scientific community to halt the fast transmission of the disease failed to prevent this contagious disease from becoming a pandemic for a whole host of reasons. After an incubation period of about two days to two weeks, a spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in individuals afflicted by COVID-19: from an asymptomatic condition that can spread the virus in the environment, to a mild/moderate disease with cold/flu-like symptoms, to deteriorated conditions that need hospitalization and intensive care unit management, and then a fatal respiratory distress syndrome that becomes refractory to oxygenation. Several diagnostic modalities have been advocated and evaluated; however, in some cases, diagnosis is made on the clinical picture in order not to lose time. A consensus on what constitutes special treatment for COVID-19 has yet to emerge. Alongside conservative and supportive care, some potential drugs have been recommended and a considerable number of investigations are ongoing in this regard",A Narrative Review of COVID-19: The New Pandemic Disease
"Background: Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is approved for insulin dosing decisions in the ambulatory setting, but not currently for inpatients. CGM has the capacity to reduce patient-provider contact in inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thus potentially reducing in hospital virus transmission. However, there are sparse data on the accuracy and efficacy of CGM to titrate insulin doses in inpatients. Methods: Under an emergency use protocol, CGM (Dexcom G6) was used alongside standard point-of-care (POC) glucose measurements in patients critically ill from complications of COVID-19 requiring intravenous (IV) insulin. Glycemic control during IV insulin therapy was retrospectively assessed comparing periods with and without adjunctive CGM use. Accuracy metrics were computed and Clarke Error Grid analysis performed comparing CGM glucose values with POC measurements. Results: 24 critically ill patients who met criteria for emergency use of CGM resulted in 47333 CGM and 5677 POC glucose values. During IV insulin therapy, individuals' glycemic control improved when CGM was used (mean difference -30.2 mg/dL). Among 2194 matched CGM:POC glucose pairs a high degree of concordance was observed with a MARD of 14.8% and 99.5% of CGM:POC pairs falling in Zones A and B of the Clarke Error Grid. Conclusions: CGM use in critically ill COVID-19 patients improved glycemic control during IV insulin therapy. CGM glucose data were highly concordant with POC glucose during IV insulin therapy in critically ill patients suggesting that CGM could substitute for POC measurements in inpatients thus reducing patient-provider contact and mitigating infection transmission.",Accuracy and Glycemic Efficacy of Continuous Glucose Monitors in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: a Retrospective Study
"As neurologists earn their living with the preservation and restoration of brain function, they are also well-positioned to address the science behind the transition from life to death. This essay in pictures highlights areas of neurological expertise needed for brain death determination; shows pitfalls to avoid during the clinical examination and interpretation of confirmatory laboratory tests in brain death protocols; illustrates the great variability of brain death legislations around the world; discusses arguments for the implementation of donation after circulatory death (DCD); points to unresolved questions related to DCD and the time between cardiac standstill and organ procurement (“hands-off period”); provides an overview of the epidemiology and semiology of near-death experiences, including their importance for religion, literature, and the visual arts; suggests biological mechanisms for near-death experiences such as dysfunction of temporoparietal cortex, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism, migraine aura, and rapid eye movement sleep; hypothesizes that thanatosis (aka. death-feigning, a common behavioral trait in the animal kingdom) represents the evolutionary origin of near-death experiences; and speculates about the future implications of recent attempts of brain resuscitation in an animal model. The aim is to provide the reader with a thorough understanding that the boundaries within the neurology of death and the dying brain are being pushed just like everywhere else in the clinical neurosciences.",The Neurology of Death and the Dying Brain: A Pictorial Essay
"The usefulness and safety of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems in adult patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported. Using CGM might reduce the exposure patients and healthcare workers to COVID-19 and limit the use of personal protective equipment during the pandemic. CGM devices measure glucose in the subcutaneous interstitial fluid, but the accuracy of this technique has not been established in critically ill patients. The artificial pancreas, STG-55 (Nikkiso, Tokyo), is a closed-loop device that conducts continuous blood glucose monitoring using a peripheral vein. We used the STG-55 for glucose control in a 60-year-old woman with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to severe respiratory failure, the patient was intubated, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was introduced. Because she had hyperglycemia despite high-dose intravenous insulin therapy, we decided to use STG-55 for glucose control. The STG-55 safely titrated the insulin infusion and monitored glucose levels. Fifty-six hours after adopting the STG-55, it was removed because the blood sampling failed. No episodes of hypoglycemia were observed despite deep sedation during this period. In conclusion, this case demonstrates the potential utility of an artificial pancreas in patients with severe COVID-19.",Glucose control using an artificial pancreas in a severe COVID-19 patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a case report
"Although the focus on service provision in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has mainly been on acute and particularly intensive care, it is important to consider other services that are still needed. This is especially the case for vulnerable patients with long-term conditions, such as those under the care of an adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) service. The authors conducted a survey of ACHD nurse specialists in centres across the UK to acertain what they were planning in terms of the redeployment of nurse specialists. The results showed a range of plans with an average of half of nurses per centre being moved, but with 65% of the workforce planned to be redeployed to deal with the pandemic. The telephone advice service at the authors' own level 1 centre showed a significant increase in patients seeking advice when compared with the previous year, with large peaks following major Government announcements. Access to specialist advice for patients with complex conditions is of vital interest, for those in a wide range of specialities.",COVID-19 and adult congenital heart disease services: impact on support and advice from nurse specialists
"BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether frailty and multimorbidity predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 beyond chronological age METHODS: 165 patients admitted from March 8th to April 17th, 2020, with COVID-19 in an acute geriatric ward in Italy were included Pre-disease frailty was assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) Multimorbidity was defined as the co-occurrence of ≥2 of these in the same patient The hazard (HR) of in-hospital mortality as a function of CFS score and number of chronic diseases in the whole population and in those aged 70+ years were calculated RESULTS: Among the 165 patients, 112 were discharged, 11 were transferred to intensive care units and 42 died Patients who died were older (81 0 vs 65 2 years, p&lt;0 001), more frequently multimorbid (97 6 vs 52 8%;p&lt;0 001) and more likely frail (37 5 vs 4 1%;p&lt;0 001) Less than 2 0% of patients without multimorbidity and frailty, 28% of those with multimorbidity only and 75% of those with both multimorbidity and frailty died Each unitary increment in the CFS was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death in the whole sample (HR=1 3;95%CI=1 05-1 62) and in patients aged 70+ years (HR=1 29;95%CI=1 04-1 62), whereas the number of chronic diseases was not significantly associated with higher risk of death The CFS addition to age and sex increased mortality prediction by 9 4% in those aged 70+ years CONCLUSIONS: Frailty identifies patients with COVID-19 at risk of in-hospital death independently of age Multimorbidity contributes to prognosis because of the very low probability of death in its absence",Beyond chronological age: Frailty and multimorbidity predict in-hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019
"BACKGROUND: The lockdown measures implemented to face the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) first wave deeply modified the lifestyle of the Italian population. Despite its efficacy in limiting the number of infections, forced home confinement was paralleled by sleep/wake cycle disruptions, psychological distress and maladaptive coping strategies (i.e., unhealthy behaviours, such as tobacco and alcohol consumption). Under these unprecedented stress conditions, we explored a possible association between poor sleep quality and increased likelihood of engaging in an unhealthy lifestyle. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted by disseminating an online survey via social networks and e-mail. We collected information on demographics, COVID-19-related data, sleep quality, chronotype, circadian misalignment, and lifestyle before and during the lockdown (i.e., consumption of cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, coffee, hypnotics, comfort food and fresh food; practice of physical activity). A global healthiness score was computed to assess participants’ modifications in lifestyle since the beginning of the lockdown. RESULTS: 1297 respondents were included in the study: 414 (31.9%) from Northern Italy, 723 (55.8%) from Central Italy, 160 (12.3%) from Southern Italy. The following variables were found to be significant predictors of the adoption of an unhealthy lifestyle since the beginning of the lockdown: poor sleep quality, high BMI and considering the measures adopted by the government to fight the pandemic as excessive. Living in Northern Italy, instead, was associated with healthier habits compared to living in Central Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleepers may represent the share of the general population who paid the highest price for social isolation. Further investigations are required to explore the role of sleep quality assessment in the identification of individuals vulnerable to unhealthy behaviours under stressful conditions.",Poor sleep quality and unhealthy lifestyle during the lockdown: an Italian study
"BACKGROUND: Major disruptions imposed on medical education by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid shift to online teaching in medical programs, necessitated need for evaluation of this format. In this study we directly compared knowledge outcomes, social outcomes, and wellbeing of first year student small group teaching in either face to face (f2f) or online format. METHODS: At the end of the first course of our medical program, students were invited to participate in an online questionnaire with 10 quantitative items and 1 qualitative item. These were analysed using Factor Analysis Pattern Matrix and linear regression to group items and assess relatedness. Qualitative responses were thematized using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA). Summative assessment results were compared, both between current cohorts to historical cohorts. RESULTS: From a cohort of 298 students there was a 77% response rate. Overall, there were no differences in knowledge gains, either between groups or when compared to historical cohorts. Questionnaire items fell reliably into groups that related to either learning outcomes, social outcomes, or wellbeing. Independent T tests showed that format for teaching (online versus f2f) had an impact on social outcomes but no direct impact on learning outcomes. Linear regression revealed that the social outcomes have a direct impact on wellbeing and almost the double the impact on learning outcomes than mode of learning i.e.. F2f or online (β = .448 and β = .232 respectively). CONCLUSION: In this study, we were able to show with statistical strength that social outcomes for students such as engaging with peers and facilitator, contributing to the group, and making friends have a direct impact on wellbeing and indirectly impact learning outcomes (such as motivation, satisfaction, integration of knowledge). In a rapidly changing educational landscape, in our opinion, it is vital that these aspects are a focus of design and delivery of medical education. The data from this study supports the notion that activity design and the expertise of the teacher in facilitating the small group activities, has greater impact than the mode of educational delivery itself on students’ learning processes.

"Eosinophilia, especially tissue eosinophilia is very rare in pulmonary tuberculosis. Here we describe a case of pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow eosinophilia probably triggered by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A 61- year-old male presented to us with cough and dyspnoea on exertion for the past 6 months with intermittent fever for the last 3 months. He didn't had any comorbidities, atopic disease, any addiction or drug intake. He was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 22 years ago. He had received two units of blood transfusion in the past 3 months because of persistent pancytopenia. His general and systemic examinations were unremarkable except for pallor and bilateral diffuse rhonchi with crepitation over the chest. Initial blood investigations revealed pancytopenia (Haemoglobin-6.3g/dl, Total leucocyte count-1400cells/ul, Platelet count-60000/ul), mild eosinophilia (Absolute eosinophil count- 580cells/cumm), with blood peripheral smear showing normocytic normochromic picture with mild eosinophilia and no haemoparasite. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 115mm at 1-hour. Rapid filarial antigen was not detected. Stool for ova, cyst was normal. Liver function and renal function tests were normal. CECT Chest showed peribronchial thickening of central bronchi with fibrotic nodule and band in the apical segment of right upper lobe causing traction bronchiectasis, and non-necrotic mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Sputum culture was sterile with acid-fast stain and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. He was managed with antibiotics, albendazole, diethylcarbamazine but showed no improvement. On further workup for persistent symptoms, pancytopenia and mild eosinophilia, serum total IgE was found markedly elevated (2701 IU/ml). HIV I & II, ANA, P-ANCA, C-ANCA were negative, with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (20 U/L) and aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE (0.06 kUA/L). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a cellular marrow with trilineage haematopoiesis with 49% eosinophils and its precursor, without any cellular atypia. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed positive CBNAAT test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a sterile culture for bacteria and fungi. He was discharged with antitubercular therapy, short course steroid, and lost to follow up during the COVID-19 pandemic.Though both peripheral and tissue eosinophilia are rare in tubercular infection with very few reported cases, our patient had significant bone marrow eosinophilia with markedly increased serum IgE level. So peripheral and bone marrow eosinophilia may be due to hypersensitivity reaction to Mycobacterium antigen in a susceptible patients. IL-5 has been implicated as an important cytokine for the expansion of peripheral/tissue eosinophilia in tuberculosis patients. So it needs further research to ascertain the cause or association hypothesis.",Bone marrow eosinophilia causing pancytopenia in pulmonary tuberculosis: A curious case
"BackgroundCompassionate Neighbours, originated from the Public Health Palliative Care model, is a community development project aimed at developing mutually beneficial relationships that also helps build social capital and capacity within our communities. One hospice located in Scotland developed such an approach by expanding the role of volunteers within the hospice. Whilst hospices have long valued volunteers for their support in the provision of a de-medicalised, holistic approach to care, this new initiative reflects a longer-term, citizen-led investment that can equip communities to help one another during times of increased health need, loss and grief. Initiated and sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project used an online blend of discussion, reflection and learning before matching Compassionate Neighbours with local people known to the hospice.AimTo capture ‘compassionate neighbours’ experience and the impact of transitioning from a traditional volunteering role to a role reflecting the ethos of compassionate citizen.MethodFocus group inclusive of 10 volunteers that were part of the compassionate communities initiative and interviews with six people in the community they were ‘matched with’.ResultsAnalysis of the data so far has highlighted how:The partnering process enabled the building of reciprocal relationships between volunteers and those they were matched with;vital to the success of the initiative.The Compassionate Neighbours negotiated, developed and sustained a mutually beneficial relationship with those they were matched with, reflecting the compassionate communities approach within the Public Health Palliative Care model.ConclusionCentral to the project’s early success and future growth has been the emergence of a different kind of volunteer;one who sees him or herself as part of a community-led social movement involving ordinary people capable of responding in practical and compassionate ways to shared problems and needs in their own communities.",From hospice volunteer to compassionate citizen: shifting the balance of care and power
"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed several challenges to the Indian healthcare system. Here, we examine the situation in India considering the moral and ethical imperatives of decision making for public health. Currently, in the absence of proven therapies, empirical evidence is being used for treatment of Covid-19 disease. We find a dual standard of practice. Currently, only modern medicine therapies are used on an empirical basis, however, the same principle is not considered for the use of AYUSH systems. Appropriate use of evidence is required. In the ethics context and in the interest of the larger public good, we suggest the inclusion of simple and safe measures from AYUSH systems in the integrative protocols for prophylaxis and treatment of Covid-19.

"Overactivation of the complement system has been characterized in severe COVID-19 cases. Complement components are known to trigger NETosis via the coagulation cascade and have also been reported in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells. In this longitudinal study, we investigated systemic and local complement activation and NETosis in COVID-19 patients that underwent mechanical ventilation. Results confirmed significantly higher baseline levels of serum C5a (24.5 ± 39.0 ng/mL) and TCC (11.03 ± 8.52 µg/mL) in patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, systemic NETosis was significantly augmented in patients (5.87 (±3.71) × 10(6) neutrophils/mL) compared to healthy controls (0.82 (±0.74) × 10(6) neutrophils/mL) (p < 0.0001). In tracheal fluid, baseline TCC levels but not C5a and NETosis, were significantly higher in patients. Kinetic studies of systemic complement activation revealed markedly higher levels of TCC and CRP in nonsurvivors compared to survivors. In contrast, kinetic studies showed decreased local NETosis in tracheal fluid but comparable local complement activation in nonsurvivors compared to survivors. Systemic TCC and NETosis were significantly correlated with inflammation and coagulation markers. We propose that a ratio comprising systemic inflammation, complement activation, and chest X-ray score could be rendered as a predictive parameter of patient outcome in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.",Systemic Inflammation and Complement Activation Parameters Predict Clinical Outcome of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infections

"Starting from December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with deadly consequences, which urgently calls for new treatments, cures and supporting apparatuses. Remdesivir was reported by World Health Organization (WHO) as the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In the absence of a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, we first construct the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identify of 95.8%). We then build the putative binding mode by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp. The putative binding structure is further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrated to be stable, indicating a reasonable binding mode for remdesivir. The relative binding free energy of remdesivir is calculated to be -8.28 ±0.65 kcal/mol, much stronger than the natural substrate ATP (-4.14 ±0.89 kcal/mol) which is needed for the polymerization. The ~800-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of APT in blocking of the RdRp binding pocket. Key residues D618, S549 and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings demonstrate that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA reproduction, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.",Binding Mechanism of Remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase

"I revisit the 1918-20 pandemic and ask whether it led to a reversal in the rise of trade and financial globalization that preceded it. Using annual data for 17 countries for the 1870-1928 period, a variety of tests and techniques are used to draw some robust conclusions. Overall, the pandemic a century ago interrupted, but did not put an end, the first globalization of the 20th century. However, two blocs consisting of combatant and non-combatant countries, experienced significantly different consequences. Globalization was sharply curtailed for the combatant countries while there were few, if any, consequences for globalization in the non-combatant group of countries. That said, there was considerable resilience especially in trade openness among several of the combatant economies. Perhaps changes in the make-up of economic blocs, post-pandemic, is a fallout from shocks of this kind. While there are lessons for the ongoing COVID pandemics differences between the 1920s and today also play a role.",Did the great influenza of 1918-1920 trigger a reversal of the first era of globalization?

"TOPIC: Diffuse Lung Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Ibrutinib is an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is indicated in treatment of certain lymphomas and is now being investigated for primary CNS diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We present a case of severe non-infectious pneumonitis in a patient receiving ibrutinib for recurrent primary CNS DLBCL CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old male with primary CNS DLBCL was treated with ibrutinib in a clinical trial after failure of first line and salvage therapies. Seven weeks after initiation of the drug, patient presented with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and encephalopathy to the hospital. Shortly after admission, patient developed worsening hypoxia and encephalopathy requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Labs demonstrated mild anemia and elevated LDH without leukocytosis or thrombocytopenia. Blood cultures and nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. CT chest showed non-specific upper lung predominant extensive bilateral ground glass opacities with patchy consolidation. Differential diagnosis included infectious and inflammatory etiologies. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for viral, mycobacterial, fungal or bacterial pathogens. Ibrutinib was discontinued and patient was treated with 60 mg intravenous methylprednisolone daily. Patient's was successfully extubated with resolving hypoxia. DISCUSSION: Common adverse effects from treatment with ibrutinib include diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, infections, and atrial fibrillation. Although infectious pneumonias have been documented, only a few accounts of non-infectious pneumonitis have been reported in the extant medical literature. Both non-specific interstitial pneumonia and organizing pneumonia cases have been reported. Early recognition in appropriate clinical context, discontinuation of offending drug, and treatment with steroids is warranted. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on targeted therapy with Ibrutinib are at risk of developing severe hypoxic respiratory failure from non-infectious pneumonitis. Timely consideration, treatment with steroids and ventilatory support can help with recovery. REFERENCE #1: 1. Mato AR, Islam P, Daniel C, Strelec L, Kaye AH, Brooks S, et al.

"OBJECTIVES To investigate the possible benefits and adverse effects of the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to a standard treatment protocol for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. DESIGN Retrospective matched cohort study. SETTING Four acute regional hospitals in Hong Kong. PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-five patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to a standard treatment protocol adopted by the Hospital Authority were matched with controls retrieved from the Hospital Authority severe acute respiratory syndrome central database. Matching was done with respect to age, sex, the presence of co-morbidities, lactate dehydrogenase level and the use of pulse steroid therapy. The 75 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir were divided into two subgroups for analysis: lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment, and lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy. These groups were compared with matched cohorts of 634 and 343 patients, respectively. Outcomes including overall death rate, oxygen desaturation, intubation rate, and use of pulse methylprednisolone were reviewed. RESULTS The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%), when compared with a matched cohort who received standard treatment (15.6% and 11.0% respectively, P<0.05) and a lower rate of use of methylprednisolone at a lower mean dose. The subgroup who had received lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy, showed no difference in overall death rate and rates of oxygen desaturation and intubation compared with the matched cohort, and received a higher mean dose of methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to a standard treatment protocol as an initial treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome appeared to be associated with improved clinical outcome. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial is recommended during future epidemics to further evaluate this treatment.",Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome with lopinavir/ritonavir: a multicentre retrospective matched cohort study.

"Importance: Acute COVID19 related myocardial, pulmonary and vascular pathology, and how these relate to each other, remains unclear. No studies have used complementary imaging techniques, including molecular imaging, to elucidate this. Objective: We used multimodality imaging and biochemical sampling in vivo to identify the pathobiology of acute COVID19. Design, Setting and Participants: Consecutive patients presenting with acute COVID19 were recruited during hospital admission in a prospective cross sectional study. Imaging involved computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA - identified coronary disease), cardiac 2deoxy2[fluorine18]fluoroDglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F FDG PET/CT identified vascular, cardiac and pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR identified myocardial disease), alongside biomarker sampling. Results: Of 33 patients (median age 51 years, 94% male), 24 (73%) had respiratory symptoms, with the remainder having non-specific viral symptoms. Nine patients (35%, n=9/25) had CMR defined myocarditis. 53% (n=5/8) of these patients had myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration. Two patients (5%) had elevated troponin levels. Cardiac troponin concentrations were not significantly higher in patients with myocarditis (8.4ng/L [IQR 4.0, 55.3] vs 3.5ng/L [2.5, 5.5], p=0.07) or myocardial cell infiltration (4.4ng/L [3.4, 8.3] vs 3.5ng/L [2.8, 7.2], p=0.89). No patients had obstructive coronary artery disease or vasculitis. Pulmonary inflammation and consolidation (percentage of total lung volume) was 17% (IQR 5, 31%) and 11% (7, 18%) respectively. Neither were associated with presence of myocarditis. Conclusions and relevance: Myocarditis was present in a third patients with acute COVID-19, and the majority had inflammatory cell infiltration. Pneumonitis was ubiquitous, but this inflammation was not associated with myocarditis. The mechanism of cardiac pathology is non-ischaemic, and not due to a vasculitic process.",Assessment of cardiovascular & pulmonary pathobiology in vivo during acute COVID-19
"The diverse array of individuals who receive long-term services and supports share one common experience, which is the need for assistance with personal care and/or other daily activities. The direct care workers (including nursing assistants, home health aides, and personal care aides) who provide this assistance play a critical role in keeping individuals safe, supporting their health and well-being, and helping prevent adverse outcomes. Yet despite decades of research, advocacy, and incremental policy and practice reform, direct care workers remain inadequately compensated, supported, and respected. Long-standing direct care job quality concerns are linked to high turnover and job vacancy rates in this workforce, which in turn compromise the availability and quality of essential care for older adults and people with disabilities-which has never been more evident than during the COVID-19 pandemic. This special article makes the case for transforming direct care jobs and stabilizing this workforce as a centerpiece of efforts to reimagine long-term services and supports system in the United States, as a public health priority, and as a social justice imperative. Drawing on research evidence and examples from the field, the article demonstrates that a strong, stable direct care workforce requires: a competitive wage and adequate employment benefits for direct care workers; updated training standards and delivery systems that prepare these workers to meet increasingly complex care needs across settings, while also enhancing career mobility and workforce flexibility; investment in well-trained frontline supervisors and peer mentors to help direct care workers navigate their challenging roles; and an elevated position for direct care workers in relation to the interdisciplinary care team. The article concludes by highlighting federal and state policy opportunities to achieve direct care job transformation, as well as discussing research and practice implications.","Transforming Direct Care Jobs, Reimagining Long-Term Services and Supports."
"With the advent of social media, concepts such as forecasting and now casting became part of the public debate. Past successes include predicting election results, stock prices and forecasting events or behaviors. This work aims at using Twitter data, related to songs and artists that appeared on the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts, performing sentiment analysis on the collected tweets, to predict the charts in the future. Our goal was to investigate the relation between the number of mentions of a song and its artist, as well as the semantic orientation of the relevant posts and its performance on the subsequent chart. The problem was approached via regression analysis, which estimated the difference between the actual and predicted positions and moderated results. We also focused on forecasting chart ranges, namely the top 5, 10 and 20. Given the accuracy and F-score achieved compared to previous research, our findings are deemed satisfactory, especially in predicting the top 20.",Using Twitter to Predict Chart Position for Songs
"Abstract The last decade has witnessed the emergence of several new viral infectious agents, most notably avian influenza H5N1, SARS and West Nile Virus. The emergence of these agents is heavily associated with zonotic animal hosts, as well as migratory pathways of infected bird vectors. The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases. Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence. We suggest that Cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia, could be a) a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and, b) a source of zoonoses through infection of the ‘target’ animal (including humans). One example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsRNA from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts, as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsRNA viral-like particles. The importance of such a surrogate relationship is discussed and its implications for human and animal health highlighted.","Avian influenza, migratory birds and emerging zoonoses: Unusual viral RNA, enteropathogens and Cryptosporidium in poultry litter"
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only targets the respiratory system but also triggers a cytokine storm and a series of complications, such as gastrointestinal problems, acute kidney injury, and myocardial ischemia. The use of natural products has been utilized to ease the symptoms of COVID-19, and in some cases, to strengthen the immune system against COVID-19. Natural products are readily available and have been regularly consumed for various health benefits. COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with the risk of thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis. These thrombotic complications often affects mortality and morbidity. Panax ginseng, which has been widely consumed for its various health benefits has also been reported for its therapeutic effects against cardiovascular disease, thrombosis and platelet aggregation. In this review, we propose that P. ginseng can be consumed as a supplementation against the various associated complications of COVID-19, especially against thrombosis. We utilized the network pharmacology approach to validate the potential therapeutic properties of P. ginseng against COVID-19 mediated thrombosis, the coagulation pathway and platelet aggregation. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the roles of P. ginseng against COVID-19 with the involvement of platelet-leukocyte aggregates in relation to immunity-related responses in COVID-19.","COVID-19 and Panax ginseng: Targeting platelet aggregation, thrombosis and the coagulation pathway"
"About half of graduate and postgraduate students and one-third of faculty in the field of neuroscience are women The proportion of women neuroscientists tend to decrease as they progress through the career ladder Their responsibilities and their opportunities to secure research funding also tend to be lower compared to men, as in most scientific disciplines and professions The multiple factors contributing to the under-representation of women in higher-level roles have historical, social, and cultural roots A process of forgetfulness of pioneer women from the last century prevented the field from having role models in which upcoming generations of women neuroscientists could have identified Maria Manasseina, Cécile Vogt, Augusta Dejerine Klumpke are only some early pioneers who have recently been rediscovered The available data show that the profiles of women neuroscientists are overlooked and their remarkable findings receive less recognition Conscious and unconscious gender biases also affect the evaluation and recruitment process The presence of cultural and institutional barriers continues to hinder equal opportunities in all aspects of the scientific and academic career The initiatives launched so far to increase awareness of such barriers and diversity in the workplace have produced a slight improvement but further action should be taken and supported to improve the condition of women in neuroscience",Women in Neuroscience: A Short Time Travel
"Since the end of February 2020, Italy has suffered one of the most severe outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, what happened just before the Italian index case has not yet been investigated. To answer this question, we evaluated the potential impact of COVID-19 on the clinical features of a cohort of neurological inpatients admitted right before the Italian index case, as compared to the same period of the previous year. Demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. The data collected included all inpatients who had been admitted to the Neurology and Stroke Units of the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, from December 15, 2018 to February 20, 2019 and from December 15, 2019 to February 20, 2020. Of the 248 patients, 97 subjects (39.1%) were admitted for an acute cerebrovascular event: 46 in the 2018/2019 period (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [15.6] years; 22 men [47.8%]), and 51 in the 2019/2020 interval (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [12.4] years; 24 men [47.1%]). The number of cryptogenic strokes has increased during the 2019-2020 year, as compared to the previous year (30 [58.8%] vs. 18 [39.1%], p = 0.05). These patients had a longer hospitalization (mean [SD] day, 15.7 [10.5] days vs. mean [SD] day, 11.7 [7.2] days, p = 0.03) and more frequent cerebrovascular complications (9 [30.0%] vs. 2 [11.1%]), but presented a lower incidence of cardiocerebral risk factors (18 [60.0%] vs. 14 [77.8%]). Right before the Italian index case, an increase in cryptogenic strokes has occurred, possibly due to the concomitant COVID-19.",Clinical features and disease course of patients with acute ischaemic stroke just before the Italian index case: Was COVID-19 already there?
"AIMS: The primary aim was to assess the patient-perceived effect of restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 on rehabilitation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Secondary aims were to assess perceived restrictions, influence on mental health, and functional outcome compared to patients undergoing surgery without restriction. METHODS: During February and March 2020, 105 patients underwent THA (n = 48) or TKA (n = 57) and completed preoperative and six-month postoperative assessments. A cohort of 415 patients undergoing surgery in 2019 were used as the control. Patient demographic data, BMI, comorbidities, Oxford Hip Score (OHS) or Knee Score (OKS), and EuroQoL five-domain (EQ-5D) score were collected preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. At six months postoperatively, the 2020 patients were also asked to complete a questionnaire relating to the effect of the social restrictions on their outcome and their mental health. RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients (47.6%, n = 50/105) felt that the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 had limited their rehabilitation and were associated with a significantly worse postoperative OKS (p < 0.001), EQ-5D score (p < 0.001), and lower satisfaction rate (p = 0.019). The reasons for the perceived limited rehabilitation were: being unable to exercise (n = 32, 64%), limited access to physiotherapy (n = 30, 60%), and no face-to-face follow-up (n = 30, 60%). A quarter (n = 26) felt that their mental health had deteriorated postoperatively; 17.1% (n = 18) felt depressed and 26.7% (n = 28) felt anxious. Joint-specific scores and satisfaction for the 2020 group were no different to the 2019 group, however patients undergoing THA in 2020 had a significantly worse postoperative EQ-5D compared to the 2019 cohort (difference 0.106; p = 0.001) which was not observed in patients undergoing TKA. CONCLUSION: Half of the 2020 cohort felt that their rehabilitation had been limited and was associated with worse postoperative Oxford and EQ-5D scores, and lower rates of patient satisfaction, but relative to the 2019 cohort their overall outcomes were no different, with the exception of THA patients who had a worse general health score.

"Rapid and sensitive quantification of RNA is critical for detecting infectious diseases and identifying disease biomarkers. Recent direct detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas13a avoid reverse transcription and DNA amplification required of gold-standard PCR assays, but these assays have not yet achieved the sensitivity of PCR and are not easily multiplexed to detect multiple viruses or variants. Here we show that Cas13a acting on single target RNAs loaded into droplets exhibits stochastic nuclease activity that can be used to enable sensitive, rapid, and multiplexed virus quantification. Using SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the target and combinations of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that recognize different parts of the viral genome, we demonstrate that reactions confined to small volumes can rapidly achieve PCR-level sensitivity. By tracking nuclease activity within individual droplets over time, we find that Cas13a exhibits rich kinetic behavior that depends on both the target RNA and crRNA. We demonstrate that these kinetic signatures can be harnessed to differentiate between different human coronavirus species as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants within a single droplet. The combination of high sensitivity, short reaction times, and multiplexing makes this droplet-based Cas13a assay with kinetic barcoding a promising strategy for direct RNA identification and quantification.",Sensitive and multiplexed RNA detection with Cas13 droplets and kinetic barcoding
"Few multicity studies have been conducted in developing countries to distinguish the acute effects of ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the years of life lost (YLL) from different subtypes of stroke. We aimed to differentiate the associations between NO2 exposure and YLL from major pathological types of stroke in China, and estimate the relevant economic loss. A time-series study was conducted to explore the associations between short-term NO2 exposure and YLL from ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke from 2013 to 2017 in 48 Chinese cities. Daily NO2 data and stroke mortality counts for each city were obtained from the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively. Generalized additive models were applied to estimate the cumulative effects of NO2 in each city, and meta-analysis was used to combine the city-specific estimates. The relevant economic loss was estimated using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY). A 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient NO2 concentration on the present day and previous day (lag 0-1) would lead to relatively higher increments in percentage change of YLL from ischaemic stroke (0.82%, 95% CI: 0.46%, 1.19%) than haemorrhagic stroke (0.46%, 95% CI: 0.09%, 0.84%). The association was significantly stronger in the low-education population than high-education population for ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, significantly higher association was found in South China than those in North China for both subtypes of stroke. Economic loss due to excess YLL from ischaemic stroke related to NO2 exposure was higher than that for haemorrhagic stroke. Our study indicated higher association and economic loss of ischaemic than haemorrhagic stroke related to NO2 exposure in China, which informed priorities for type-specific stroke prevention strategies related to NO2 pollution and vulnerable population protection.",Years of life lost from ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke related to ambient nitrogen dioxide exposure: A multicity study in China.
"As has been consistently demonstrated, rapid tests administered at regular intervals can offer significant benefits to both individuals and their communities at large by helping identify whether an individual is infected and potentially infectious. An additional advantage to the individual is that positive tests may be provided sufficiently early enough during their infection that treatment with antiviral treatments can effectively inhibit development of severe disease, particularly when PCR uptake is limited and delays to receipt of results are substantial. Here, we provide a quantitative illustration of the extent to which rapid tests administered at various intervals can deliver benefits accrued from the novel Pfizer treatment (Paxlovid). We find that strategies for which tests are administered more routinely, i.e. every other day or once every three days, are associated with greater reductions in the risk of hospitalization and correspondingly, higher proportions of the infected population benefiting from treatment. We further observed that reduced positive-test-to-treatment delays and increased treatment coverage have a critical influence on average treatment benefits, signaling the importance of treatment access.",The impact of recurrent rapid test strategies on the effectiveness of at-home antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2
"The discovery of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as the receptor for SARS- CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) has implicated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The angiotensin converting enzyme-1-angiotensin II-angiotensin AT1 receptor pathway contributes to the pathophysiology of ARDS, whereas activation of the ACE-2-angiotensin(1-7)-angiotensin AT2 receptor and the ACE-2-angiotensin(1-7)-Mas receptor pathways have been shown to be protective. Here we propose and discuss therapeutic considerations how to increase soluble ACE-2 in plasma in order for ACE-2 to capture and thereby inactivate SARS-CoV-2. This could be achieved by administering recombinant soluble ACE-2. We also discuss why and how ACEIs and ARBs provide cardiovascular, renal and also pulmonary protection in SARS-CoV-2- associated ARDS. Discontinuing these medications in COVID-19 patients may therefore potentially be harmful.",Potential harmful effects of discontinuing ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in COVID-19 patients
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has left a huge mark on everyday lives, introducing restrictions and plunging the global economy. This study aimed to analyze the available epidemiological data from the register of one of the largest laboratories testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the Silesian voivodship of Poland. Methods: This analysis is based upon the epidemiological records collected between 30 March 2020, and 30 April 2021, by the Silesian Park of Medical Technology Kardio-Med Silesia (Zabrze, Poland). In addition, we performed SARS-CoV-2 variant detection in samples from patients reinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Results: Our results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 infections are more common in urban areas. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases represent 13.21% of all RT-PCR test results during the 13 months of our laboratory diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in samples of potentially reinfected patients showed discrepancies in the results. Conclusions: Due to the higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the Upper Silesian population, the region is at greater risk of deteriorating economic situation and healthcare as compared to other areas of Poland. RT-PCR methods are inexpensive and suitable for large-scale screening, but they can be untrustworthy so detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in samples should be confirmed by sequencing.","RT-PCR Detection of SARS-CoV-2 among Individuals from the Upper Silesian Region—Analysis of 108,516 Tests"
"Software organizations are increasingly incorporating machine learning (ML) into their product offerings, driving a need for new data management tools. Many of these tools facilitate the initial development of ML applications, but sustaining these applications post-deployment is difficult due to lack of real-time feedback (i.e., labels) for predictions and silent failures that could occur at any stage, or component, of the ML pipeline (e.g., data distribution shift). We propose a new type of data management system that offers end-to-end observability, or visibility into complex system behavior, for ML pipelines through assisted (1) detection, (2) diagnosis, and (3) reaction to ML-related bugs. We describe new research challenges and suggest preliminary solution ideas in all three aspects.

"BACKGROUND Accelerated malignant behaviors induced by insufficient thermal ablation have been increasingly reported, however, the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigated the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in modulating the progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after heat treatment. METHODS Heat-exposed residual HCC cells were cultured in different ECM gels. We used basement membrane gel (Matrigel) to simulate the normal microenvironment and collagen I to model the pathological stromal ECM. The alterations of morphology and parameters of proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS Increased collagen I deposition was observed at the periablational zone after incomplete RFA of HCC in a xenograft model. The markers of cell proliferation, EMT, motility and progenitor-like traits of heat-exposed residual HCC cells were significantly induced by collagen I as compared to Matrigel (p values all < 0.05). Importantly, collagen I induced the activation of ERK phosphorylation in heat-exposed residual HCC cells. ERK1/2 inhibitor reversed the collagen I-promoted ERK phosphorylation, cell proliferative, protrusive and spindle-like appearance of heat-treated residual HCC cells in vitro. Moreover, collagen I promoted the in vivo tumor progression of heat-exposed residual HCC cells, and sorafenib markedly reversed the collagen I-mediated protumor effects. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that collagen I could enhance the aggressive progression of residual HCC cells after suboptimal heat treatment and sorafenib may be a treatment approach to thwart this process.",Extracellular matrix collagen I promotes the tumor progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma after heat treatment.
"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to compare the various nonlinear and time series models in describing the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. To this aim, we focus on 2 indicators: the number of total cases diagnosed with the disease, and the death toll. METHODS: The data used for this study are based on the reports of China between January 22 and June 18, 2020. We used nonlinear growth curves and some time series models for prediction of the number of total cases and total deaths. The determination coefficient (R(2)), mean square error (MSE), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to select the best model. RESULTS: Our results show that while the Sloboda and ARIMA (0,2,1) models are the most convenient models that elucidate the cumulative number of cases; the Lundqvist-Korf model and Holt linear trend exponential smoothing model are the most suitable models for analyzing the cumulative number of deaths. Our time series models forecast that on 19 July, the number of total cases and total deaths will be 85,589 and 4639, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study will be of great importance when it comes to modeling outbreak indicators for other countries. This information will enable governments to implement suitable measures for subsequent similar situations.",Modeling of COVID-19 Outbreak Indicators in China Between January and June

Pandemics such as Covid-19 change the status quo. The things we take for granted become no longer true. When the disease is contagious then in-person communication is fraught with danger for all parties. Despite all these dangers people still required to meet in person for various reasons that could range from personal to official to government business. Can we have a way to understand the risk of a person being infected as compared to another person so that we can make decisions of segregating the two people or to decline entry to a person? In this paper we provide an architecture and an approach that caters to estimating a score for each person based on GPS (Global Positioning System) locations. A score is computed by an application running in cloud and receiving as input the GPS trajectory information from each person's device (like a mobile or a smart watch). With the scores of any two people in hand one can predict who is more likely to be infected. We complement this approach with extensive simulation results to validate our approach. Our results show that we can achieve a high accuracy (80% to 90%) of predicting which person (of the two being compared) has an infection. © 2020 IEEE.,Managing Congregations of People by Predicting Likelihood of a Person being Infected by a Contagious Disease like the COVID Virus
"Background: Despite the purported advantages and potential efficacy of mHealth interventions to promote wellness in children, adolescents, and young adults, it is not clear what areas have been explored and the challenges reported in the biomedical literature. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of publications between 2015 and 2019. Results: We identified 54 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in 21 countries and ranged in size from six to 9851 participants (median: 184). A total of 41% of studies enrolled adolescents only (n = 19). Of the seven types of mHealth interventions identified, apps were the most common intervention (59%; n = 32) evaluated and 44% of the studies evaluated two or more interventions. The most common topic of the studies reviewed was sexual and reproductive health (24%; n = 13). Conclusion: Most pediatric mHealth intervention studies are conducted in adolescents in large part, and sexual and reproductive health is the most commonly studied topic. With the easy and widespread accessibility to smartphone technology, the use of mobile apps for wellness interventions will likely continue to expand to other wellness topics.",A Systematic Review of the Scope of Study of mHealth Interventions for Wellness and Related Challenges in Pediatric and Young Adult Populations
"PURPOSE: To establish a normative database and optimise parameters for personal-computer based perimetry via a web-application using circular contrast targets. METHODS: Online 24-degree 52-loci perimetry was delivered through a web-application using circular flickering contrast targets. Embedding contrast differentials within targets allows calculation of relative decibel (rdB) per 256-bit greyscale level differential. Target light-band maximum brightness colour was fixed, while the dark-band varied to achieve the desired rdB level. A staircase system was used with two reversals ranging from 0 to 36 rdB levels. Blind spot localisation at the start of the test was used to optimise viewing distance and subsequently count fixation losses. Gaze was maintained on a spinning golden star which moves mid-test to maximise sampling area. Patients performed the test to each eye separately using a computer in a darkened room at 40–45 cm. RESULTS: 158 eyes of 101 patients completed the Online Circular Contrast Perimetry (OCCP) test. Mean age was 62.9 ± 14.3 years old. Mean sensitivity reduced with age, at 1.0 relative decibel per decade. Mean sensitivity per locus correlated with standard automated perimetry (SAP) in a physiological hill of vision, with an average difference of 4.02 decibels (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.77–4.27, p < 0.001) and good agreement between tests.

"Background: Until July 14, 2020, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 130 million individuals and has caused a certain degree of panic. Viral pneumonia caused by common viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses have been more common in children. However, the incidence of COVID-19 in children was significantly lower than that in adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 in children compared to those of other sources of viral pneumonia diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Children with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia admitted to 20 hospitals were enrolled in this retrospective multi-center cohort study. A total of 64 children with COVID-19 were defined as the COVID-19 cohort, of which 40 children who developed pneumonia were defined as the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort. Another 284 children with pneumonia caused by other viruses were defined as the viral pneumonia cohort. Results: Compared to the viral pneumonia cohort, children in the COVID-19 cohort were mostly exposed to family members confirmed to have COVID-19 (53/64 vs. 23/284), were of older median age (6.3 vs. 3.2 years), and had a higher proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO) on computed tomography (18/40 vs. 0/38) (all P ＜0.001). Children in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort had a lower proportion of severe cases (1/40 vs. 38/284, P =0.048), and lower cases with high fever (3/40 vs 167/284, P ＜0.001), requiring intensive care (1/40 vs 32/284, P ＜0.047) and with shorter symptomatic duration (median 5 vs 8 days, P ＜0.001). The proportion of cases with evaluated inflammatory indicators, biochemical indicators related to organ or tissue damage, D-dimer and secondary bacterial infection were lower in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort than in the viral pneumonia cohort (all P ＜0.05). No statistical differences were found in the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in 25 children with COVID-19 who received antiviral drugs (lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, and arbidol) as compared to duration in 39 children without antiviral therapy [median 10 vs. 9 days, P =0.885]. Conclusion: The symptoms and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in children were no more severe than those in children with other viral pneumonias. Lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin and arbidol do not shorten the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in children with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 outbreak, attention also must be given to children with infection by other pathogens infection.",Comparison of acute pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 and other respiratory viruses in children: a retrospective multi-center cohort study during COVID-19 outbreak

Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non-linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non- polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real-time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time.",A Novel Blockchain and Bi-Linear Polynomial-Based QCP-ABE Framework for Privacy and Security over the Complex Cloud Data
"Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)-induced altered proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins and basement membrane holds the key for tumor progression and metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinases-7 (Matrilysin), the smallest member of the MMP family also performs quite alike; thus serves as a potential candidate for anti-tumor immunotherapy. Conversely, being an endogenous tumor-associated antigen (TAA), targeting MMP-7 for immunization is challenging. But MMP-7-based xenovaccine can surmount the obstacle of poor immunogenicity and immunological tolerance, often encountered in TAA-based conventional vaccine for anti-tumor immunotherapy. This paves the way for investigating the potential of MMP-7-derived major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding peptides to elicit precise epitope-specific T-cell responses towards their possible inclusion in anti-tumor vaccine formulations. Perhaps it also ushers the path of achieving multiple epitope-based broad and universal cellular immunity. In current experiment, an immunoinformatics approach has been employed to identify the putative canine matrix matelloproteinases-7 (cMMP-7)-derived peptides with MHC class-I-binding motifs which can elicit potent antigen-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice. Immunization with the cMMP-7 DNA vaccine induced a strong CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Th1- type response, with high level of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production in BALB/c mice. The two identified putative MHC-I-binding nonameric peptides (Peptide(32-40) and Peptide(175-183)) from cMMP-7 induced significant lymphocyte proliferation along with the production of IFN-γ from CD8(+) T-cells in mice immunized with cMMP-7 DNA vaccine. The current observation has depicted the immunogenic potential of the two cMMP-7-derived nonapeptides for their possible exploitation in xenovaccine-mediated anti-tumor immunotherapy in mouse model.",MMP-7 derived peptides with MHC class-I binding motifs from canine mammary tumor tissue elicit strong antigen-specific T-cell responses in BALB/c mice
"Importance: Socioeconomically marginalized communities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Income inequality may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the association between county-level income inequality and COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 2020 through February 2021 in bimonthly time epochs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This ecological cohort study used longitudinal data on county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, in 3220 counties from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Main Outcomes and Measures: County-level daily COVID-19 case and death data from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, were extracted from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Exposure: The Gini coefficient, a measure of unequal income distribution (presented as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a perfectly equal geographical region where all income is equally shared and 1 represents a perfectly unequal society where all income is earned by 1 individual), and other county-level data were obtained primarily from the 2014 to 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Covariates included median proportions of poverty, age, race/ethnicity, crowding given by occupancy per room, urbanicity and rurality, educational level, number of physicians per 100â¯000 individuals, state, and mask use at the county level. Results: As of February 28, 2021, on average, each county recorded a median of 8891 cases of COVID-19 per 100â¯000 individuals (interquartile range, 6935-10â¯666 cases per 100â¯000 individuals) and 156 deaths per 100â¯000 individuals (interquartile range, 94-228 deaths per 100â¯000 individuals). The median county-level Gini coefficient was 0.44 (interquartile range, 0.42-0.47). There was a positive correlation between Gini coefficients and county-level COVID-19 cases (Spearman &#961; = 0.052; P < .001) and deaths (Spearman &#961; = 0.134; P < .001) during the study period. This association varied over time; each 0.05-unit increase in Gini coefficient was associated with an adjusted relative risk of COVID-19 deaths: 1.25 (95% CI, 1.17-1.33) in March and April 2020, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.13-1.28) in May and June 2020, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.37-1.55) in July and August 2020, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.10) in September and October 2020, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81) in November and December 2020, and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.07) in January and February 2021 (P < .001 for interaction). The adjusted association of the Gini coefficient with COVID-19 cases also reached a peak in July and August 2020 (relative risk, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.22-1.33]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that income inequality within US counties was associated with more cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the summer months of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vast disparities that exist in health outcomes owing to income inequality in the US. Targeted interventions should be focused on areas of income inequality to both flatten the curve and lessen the burden of inequality.",Association Between Income Inequality and County-Level COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a serious impact on health and economics worldwide Even though the majority of patients present with moderate and mild symptoms, yet a considerable portion of patients need to be treated in the intensive care unit Aside from dexamethasone, there is no established pharmacological therapy Moreover, some of the currently tested drugs are contraindicated for special patient populations like remdesivir for patients with severely impaired renal function On this background, several extracorporeal treatments are currently explored concerning their potential to improve the clinical course and outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19 Here, we report the use of the Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity filter, which is licensed in the European Union for the removal of pathogens Authorization for emergency use in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure was granted by the U S Food and Drug Administration on April 17, 2020 A 53-year-old Caucasian male with a severe COVID-19 infection was treated with a Seraph Microbind Affinity filter hemoperfusion after clinical deterioration and commencement of mechanical ventilation The 70-minute treatment at a blood flow of 200 mL/minute was well tolerated, and the patient was hemodynamically stable The hemoperfusion reduced D-dimers dramatically This case report suggests that the use of Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity filter hemoperfusion might have positive effects on the clinical course of critically ill patients with COVID-19 However, future prospective collection of data ideally in randomized trials will have to confirm whether the use of Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity filter hemoperfusion is an option of the treatment for COVID-19",Treatment of a Critically Ill COVID-19 Patient with the Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Filter

"Helicobacter pylori is a class one carcinogen which causes chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The mechanisms by which H. pylori interacts with other risk and protective factors, particularly vitamin C in gastric carcinogenesis are complex. Gastric carcinogenesis includes metabolic, environmental, epigenetic, genomic, infective, inflammatory and oncogenic pathways. The molecular classification of gastric cancer subtypes has revolutionized the understanding of gastric carcinogenesis. This includes the tumour microenvironment, germline mutations, and the role of Helicobacter pylori bacteria, Epstein Barr virus and epigenetics in somatic mutations. There is evidence that ascorbic acid, phytochemicals and endogenous antioxidant systems can modify the risk of gastric cancer. Gastric juice ascorbate levels depend on dietary intake of ascorbic acid but can also be decreased by H. pylori infection, H. pylori CagA secretion, tobacco smoking, achlorhydria and chronic atrophic gastritis. Ascorbic acid may be protective against gastric cancer by its antioxidant effect in gastric cytoprotection, regenerating active vitamin E and glutathione, inhibiting endogenous N-nitrosation, reducing toxic effects of ingested nitrosodimethylamines and heterocyclic amines, and preventing H. pylori infection. The effectiveness of such cytoprotection is related to H. pylori strain virulence, particularly CagA expression. The role of vitamin C in epigenetic reprogramming in gastric cancer is still evolving. Other factors in conjunction with vitamin C also play a role in gastric carcinogenesis. Eradication of H. pylori may lead to recovery of vitamin C secretion by gastric epithelium and enable regression of premalignant gastric lesions, thereby interrupting the Correa cascade of gastric carcinogenesis.","Pathways of Gastric Carcinogenesis, Helicobacter pylori Virulence and Interactions with Antioxidant Systems, Vitamin C and Phytochemicals"
"The global impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is significant in terms of public health effects and its long-term socio-economic implications. Among all social groups, the elderly is by far the most affected age group regarding morbidity and mortality. In multiple countries spanning several continents, there are an increasing number of reports referencing the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread among nursing homes. These areas are now recognized as potent hotspots regarding the pandemic, which one considers with special regard. Herein, we present currently available data of fatal COVID-19 cases throughout Hungary, along with the analysis of the co-morbidity network. We also report on viral genomic data originating from a nursing home resident. The genomic data was used for viral haplotype network analysis. We emphasize the urgent need for public health authorities to focus on nursing homes and residential service units worldwide, especially in the care of the elderly and infirmed. Our results further emphasize the recent statement released by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the vulnerability among seniors and especially the high risk of COVID-19 emergence throughout nursing and social homes.",Nursing homes and the elderly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: situation report from Hungary.

"Our study presents time-critical empirical results on the SARS-CoV-2 fatality risk perception of 1182 US adult residents stratified for age and gender. Given the current epidemiological figures, our findings suggest that many US adult residents severely underestimate their absolute and relative fatality risk if infected with SARS-CoV-2. These results are worrying because risk perception, as our study suggests, relates to self-reported actual or intended behavior that can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates.",Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Fatality Risk Perception in US Adult Residents
"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a leading cause of inherited retinal degeneration, with more than 60 gene mutations. Despite the genetic heterogenicity, photoreceptor cell damage remains the hallmark of RP pathology. As a result, RP patients usually suffer from reduced night vision, loss of peripheral vision, decreased visual acuity, and impaired color perception. Although photoreceptor cell death is the primary outcome of RP, the underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Ferroptosis is a novel programmed cell death, with characteristic iron overload and lipid peroxidation. Recent studies, using in vitro and in vivo RP models, discovered the involvement of ferroptosis-associated cell death, suggesting a possible new mechanism for RP pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the association between ferroptosis and photoreceptor cell damage, and its implication in the pathogenesis of RP. We propose that ferroptotic cell death not only opens up a new research area in RP, but may also serve as a novel therapeutic target for RP.",Cell Ferroptosis: New Mechanism and New Hope for Retinitis Pigmentosa
"Human travel is one of the primary drivers of infectious disease spread. Models of travel are often used that assume the amount of travel to a specific destination decreases as cost of travel increases with higher travel volumes to more populated destinations. Trip duration, the length of time spent in a destination, can also impact travel patterns. We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations. Further, pathogens with a longer generation time have more diffusive patterns of spatial spread reflecting more unpredictable disease dynamics.",Trip duration drives shift in travel network structure with implications for the predictability of spatial disease spread
"BACKGROUND: Nephrotic syndrome is a unique clinical disorder, which provides interesting teaching opportunities that connect physiological and pathological aspects to clinical practice. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was not permitted, thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills teaching. A case-based electronic learning (e-learning) activity was designed to replace the traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. e-Learning activities have been shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners' performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with e-learning activities as the sole form of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students' perceptions of and satisfaction with an e-learning activity teaching renal semiology. METHODS: All second-year medical students (novice learners) from the medical faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, undertook the e-learning activity and were invited to participate in a nonmandatory, validated web-based survey, comprising questions answered using a 10-point Likert scale and one qualitative open-ended question. For comparison and to provide further insights, 17 fourth- to sixth-year students (advanced learners) were prospectively recruited to participate in both the e-learning activity and the evaluation. A mixed methods analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 88 (63%) out of 141 novice learners and all advanced learners responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction with the e-learning activity (mean 8.7, SD 1.0 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.8; P<.001), clarity of objectives (mean 9.6, SD 0.8 vs mean 7.7, SD 1.7; P<.001), and attainability of objectives (mean 9.8, SD 0.5 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.3; P<.001). Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of a blended learning approach; however, there was low interest in the activity being the sole means of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: Case-based e-learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners' satisfaction within a blended teaching instructional design. More research on students' satisfaction with e-learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done. In addition, more effort should be put into finding alternative teaching tools for clinical skills education in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future health crises.",Novice and Advanced Learners' Satisfaction and Perceptions of an e-Learning Renal Semiology Module During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Study
"Case studies and student-led learning activities are both effective active learning methods for increasing student engagement, promoting student learning, and improving student performance. Here, we describe combining these instructional methods to use student-created case studies as assessment for an online neurovirology module in a neuroanatomy and physiology course. First, students learned about neurovirology in a flipped classroom format using free, open-access virology resources. Then, students used iterative writing practices to write an interrupted case study incorporating a patient narrative and primary literature data on the neurovirulent virus of their choice, which was graded as a writing assessment. Finally, students exchanged case studies with their peers, and both taught and completed the case studies as low-stakes assessment. Student performance and evaluations support the efficacy of case studies as assessment, where iterative writing improved student performance, and students reported increased knowledge and confidence in the corresponding learning objectives. Overall, we believe that using student-created case studies as assessment is a valuable, student-led extension of effective case study pedagogy, and has wide applicability to a variety of undergraduate courses.",Effective Use of Student-Created Case Studies as Assessment in an Undergraduate Neuroscience Course.
"Background: Some patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who present with fibrosis on computed tomography (CT) require prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). Lung ultrasound (LUS), a rapid, bedside test, has been reported to have findings consistent with those of CT. Thus, this study aimed to assess whether serial LUS scores could predict PMV or successful extubation in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: : LUS was performed for 20 consecutive severe COVID-19 patients at three time points: admission (day 1), after 48 h (day 3), and seventh-day follow-up (day 7). We compared the LUS score with the results of chest X-rays and laboratory tests at three time points. Moreover, we assessed LUS score to determine the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the results among examiners. Results: : While there were no significant differences in mortality in each PMV and successful extubation groups, there were significant differences in LUS scores on day 3 and day 7;XP score on day 7;and P/F ratio on day 7 in the PMV group (p<0.05). There were significant differences in LUS scores on days 3 and 7, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on day 7, and P/F ratio on day 7 in the successful extubation group (p<0.05). The areas under the curves (AUCs) of LUS score on days 3 and 7, XP score on day 7, and P/F ratio were 0.88, 0.98, 0.77, and 0.80, respectively in the PMV group;and the AUCs of LUS score on days 3 and 7, CRP levels on day 7, and P/F ratio 0.79, 0.90, 0.82, and 0.79, respectively, in the successful extubation group. Variations in serial LUS scores exhibited significant differences between the groups. The serial LUS score on day 7 was higher than that on day 1 in the PMV group but lower in the successful extubation group (p<0.05). However, there was slight IRR agreement in the LUS score changes on days 1 to 7 (κ= 0.15 [95% CI: 0-0.31]). Conclusions: : The serial LUS score of severe COVID-19 patients could predicted PMV and successful extubation. To overcome IRR disagreement, the automatic ultrasound judgement, such as deep learning, would be needed.",Do Serial Lung Ultrasound Scores Predict Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation in Patients With Severe COVID-19?

"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumours worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs regulate the occurrence and development of various cancers and play an important role in GC progression. X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a carcinogenic lncRNA, is involved in human tumourigenesis and is altered in GC. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a transcription factor, is involved in cancer cell metastasis and differentiation. However, the exact mechanism underlying the biological roles of XIST and JAK2 in cancer cells remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted using GES-1, HGC-27, AGS and HEK-293 T cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect XIST, microRNA-337 (miR-337) and JAK2 expressions. GC cell invasion was investigated by using the Transwell assay. Fluorescein reporter gene detection was used to determine the relationship between JAK2 and XIST. RESULTS: Compared with that in GES-1 cells, XIST expression was significantly up-regulated in AGS and HGC-27 cells. miR-337 expression in GC cell lines was decreased. The proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells were simultaneously inhibited by XIST knockdown, and the relationship between XIST and miR-337 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis. JAK2 is expected to be the target gene of miR-337. MiR-337 can negatively regulate JAK2 expression in vitro. In addition, si-XIST decreased JAK2 expression by up-regulating miR-337 in vitro, thereby inhibiting GC cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, we speculated that XIST regulates JAK2 by competing with miR-337 as a competitive endogenous lncRNA in GC. CONCLUSION: We elucidated the effects of migration and invasion after XIST inhibition, at least in part, by inhibiting miR-337 expression in GC cells to regulate JAK2. These data indicate that a positive feedback loop exists between XIST and JAK2 and suggest that JAK2 and XIST play a vital role in cancer cell migration and invasion.","The lncRNA XIST promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by targeting miR-337"

"The coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory disease reported in 2019 in China. The infection is very destructive to human lives and caused millions of deaths. Various approaches have been made recently to understand the complex dynamics of COVID-19. The mathematical modeling approach is one of the considerable tools to study the disease spreading pattern. In this article, we develop a fractional order epidemic model for COVID-19 in the sense of Caputo operator. The model is based on the effective contacts among the population and environmental impact to analyze the disease dynamics. The fractional models are comparatively better in understanding the disease outbreak and providing deeper insights into the infectious disease dynamics. We first consider the classical integer model studied in recent literature and then we generalize it by introducing the Caputo fractional derivative. Furthermore, we explore some fundamental mathematical analysis of the fractional model, including the basic reproductive number R 0 and equilibria stability utilizing the Routh-Hurwitz and the Lyapunov function approaches. Besides theoretical analysis, we also focused on the numerical solution. To simulate the model, we use the well-known generalized Adams-Bashforth Moulton Scheme. Finally, the influence of some of the model essential parameters on the dynamics of the disease is demonstrated graphically.",Numerical simulation of a Caputo fractional epidemic model for the novel coronavirus with the impact of environmental transmission
"Keywords: Dance;Compliance;Group Purpose: Deconditioned, hypermobile, and symptomatic musculoskeletal pain in children can cause a reduced level of physical activity leading to weakened muscles and poor tolerance to exercise. Dance and music have been shown to positively affect mood and mental health in individuals, helping to increase compliance of physical activity. Group settings provide evidence for increasing compliance through improving patient's sense of belonging, self-confidence and social engagement. This pilot looks at combining the enjoyment of dance to music in a group setting with physiotherapy strengthening and core exercises to increase engagement, We aim to evaluate the outcome measures to direct the formation of a larger scale study. Methods: The pilot study included children aged 8–16 years old referred by Southampton Paediatric Physiotherapy team with a diagnosis of hypermobility, poor postural fitness and deconditioning with an interest in dance. Children were excluded if they were 7 years old or younger and if they would be unable to follow a group session. The group comprised of a four week (once weekly) group for 45 min consisting of group exercise with warm up, 15 min dance cardio fitness including balance, strengthening, core stability, and cool down sections. A questionnaire assessing patients perceived fitness, pain and overall enjoyment was the outcome measure completed at the beginning and end of the group. Results: Two patients attended the group between November 2020 and December 2020. The post group questionnaire showed both patients found the group very useful or extremely useful. The questionnaire also showed an improvement in sporting activity post group. Both patients also stated an interest in repeating the group and found that it was a positive experience for young people of their age to do fitness in a safe environment. The Coronavirus Pandemic impacted on the sample size of this pilot. Conclusion(s): The results of this small sample pilot have shown very positive outcomes. The pilot highlights the success of using dance as a positive motivator to increase physical activity in those deconditioned and hypermobile patients. The use of music and dance movements helped to engage patients to strengthen weakened muscles and improve compliance to exercise. Future Dance fitness groups could include patients with back pain with the outcome measure Rowland Morris to be used. Limitations of COVID-19 restrictions meant a small sample, however future groups should be repeated on a large scale with up to 6 children in a group. Impact: This was a small scale pilot study which has shown positive evaluation to transform the way we run our groups. With future larger scale quantitative and qualitative results we will further evaluate the impact on our physiotherapy practice. We aim to reduce 1:1 out-patient appointments due to positive outcomes of group treatment using a holistic and innovative approach to improve engagement and compliance to physical activity.

This study analyzed data collected from the project work plan; participant rosters; participant surveys; workshop outputs; and focus group interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Efficacy was measured in terms of ISO 9241-11, an international standard for usability that includes effectiveness, efficiency, user satisfaction, and ""freedom from risk"" among users. Degree of engagement was considered an indicator of ""freedom from risk,"" measurable through workshop attendance. RESULTS Two separate communities drafted and exercised ~60-page-long population protection plans, each within 14.5 hours. Plan-writing workshops completed 100% of plan objectives and activities. Efficiency rates were nearly the same in both communities. Interviews and surveys indicated high degrees of community satisfaction. Engagement was consistent among community members and variable among governmental officials. CONCLUSIONS Frontline communities have successfully demonstrated the ability to understand the environmental health hazards in their own community; rapidly write consensus-based plans for PPMs; participate in an objective-based TTX; and perform these activities in a bi-lingual setting. This intervention appears to be efficacious for public use in the rapid development of community-based PPMs.",Measuring the Efficacy of a Pilot Public Health Intervention for Engaging Communities of Puerto Rico to Rapidly Write Hurricane Protection Plans.
"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Global Indicator Framework (GIF) has multiplied training needs due to the large number of new indicators to be monitored by countries, whereas COVID-19-related social distancing restrictions have provided an unexpected springboard for the proliferation of cutting-edge virtual training tools and modalities. This has exposed a panoply of new data-related skills needed by contemporary statisticians, and therefore the types of training that could be most appropriate for acquiring these skills. This paper analyses the changing context and nature of training, with particular reference to the experience of FAO as a custodian agency for a large share of SDG indicators. The combination of different learning modalities, appropriately blended into a coherent learning programme, is shown to have the greatest impact, with one modality reinforcing the strengths and dampening the limitations of another. © 2021 - The authors.

"Delta variant has rapidly become the predominant pandemic driver and yielded four subvariants (delta1, delta2, delta3 and delta4). Among them, delta1 has been mainly responsible for the latest COVID-19 waves in India, Southeast Asia, Europe and the USA. A relevant question is how delta subvariants may have driven the pandemic in the rest of the world. In both Israel and Qatar, mRNA-based vaccination has been rolled out competitively, but the outcomes are quite different in terms of controlling the recent waves resulting from delta variant. This raises the question whether delta subvariants have acted differently in Israel and Qatar. In both countries, delta variant was first identified in April 2021 and delta1 subvariant constituted ~50% delta genomes from April to May 2021. But the situation started to diverge in June 2021: In Israel, delta1 variant was encoded by 92.0% delta genomes, whereas this fraction was only 43.9% in Qatar. Moreover, a delta1 sublineage encoding spike T791I was identified in Israel but not Qatar. This sublineage accounted for 31.8% delta genomes sequenced in June 2021 and declined to 13.3% in October 2021. In August 2021, delta1 also became dominant in Qatar and a major sublineage encoding spike D1259H emerged. This sublineage has evolved further and acquired additional spike substitutions, including K97E, S255F, I693S, I712S, I1104L, E1258D and/or V1177I, in Qatar and other countries, such as Czech Republic, France and Mexico. Monthly distribution of the above sublineages suggests that the one from Qatar is much more of concern than that from Israel. Different from what was in Israel and Qatar, delta2 subvariant has also been important in Bahrain, whereas a delta2 sublineage encoding spike V1264L and A1736V of NSP3 was dominant in June 2021, but was gradually taken over by delta1 subvariant. These results suggest that delta1 and delta2 subvariants continue their evolution in different countries. The recent successful pandemic control in Israel, Qatar and Bahrain supports that delta1 and delta2 subvariants are still sensitive to timed vaccination, thereby urging the use of optimal immunity as a strategy to block SARS-COV-2 evolution and control the pandemic.","Delta subvariants of SARS-COV-2 in Israel, Qatar and Bahrain: Optimal vaccination as an effective strategy to block viral evolution and control the pandemic"
"Matching a nonprobability sample to a probability sample is one strategy both for selecting the nonprobability units and for weighting them. This approach has been employed in the past to select subsamples of persons from a large panel of volunteers. One method of weighting, introduced here, is to assign a unit in the nonprobability sample the weight from its matched case in the probability sample. The properties of resulting estimators depend on whether the probability sample weights are inverses of selection probabilities or are calibrated. In addition, imperfect matching can cause estimates from the matched sample to be biased so that its weights need to be adjusted, especially when the size of the volunteer panel is small. Calibration weighting combined with matching is one approach to correcting bias and reducing variances. We explore the theoretical properties of the matched and matched, calibrated estimators with respect to a quasirandomization distribution that is assumed to describe how units in the nonprobability sample are observed, a superpopulation model for analysis variables collected in the nonprobability sample, and the randomization distribution for the probability sample. Numerical studies using simulated and real data from the 2015 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey are conducted to examine the performance of the alternative estimators.",Investigating an Alternative for Estimation from a Nonprobability Sample: Matching plus Calibration
"Summary Objective To determine the prevalence of human rhinoviruses (HRV) infections in children with lower respiratory disease in Thailand and monitor the association between species of HRV and clinical presentation in hospitalized paediatric patients. Method Two hundred and eighty-nine nasopharyngeal (NP) suction specimens were collected from hospitalized paediatric patients admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand during February 2006–2007. Nucleic acids were extracted from each sample with subsequent amplification of VP4/2 by semi-nested RT-PCR for HRV detection. Other viral respiratory pathogens were also detected by PCR, RT-PCR or real time PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the VP4 region were used for genotyping and phylogenetic tree construction. Result In total, 87 of 289 specimens were positive for HRV indicating an annual prevalence of 30%. Wheezing or asthma exacerbation was the most common clinical presentation observed in infected patients. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that 29 (33%) and 8 (9%) specimens belonged to HRV-A and HRV-B, respectively. Most of the HRV positive samples were HRV-C (58%). Moreover, species C was predominantly found in the paediatric population of Thailand in raining season (p <0.05). The frequency of co-infection of HRV-C with other respiratory viral pathogens was approximately 40%. Conclusion HRV-C represents the predominant species and is one of the etiologic agents in acute lower respiratory tract infection, causes of wheezing and asthma exacerbation in infants and young children in Thailand.",High prevalence of human rhinovirus C infection in Thai children with acute lower respiratory tract disease
"Emotions play a central role in scientific models of decision-making, human development, interpersonal processes, psychopathology, and well-being. The Emotional Style Questionnaire (ESQ) is a novel and multifaceted psychometric scale that assesses the dimensions of individual’s emotional styles. The present study evaluated the validity and factor structure of the Persian ESQ. The original version of the ESQ was translated and back-translated into Persian, followed by a pilot study. A sample of university students and staff participated in a survey (n = 822) which included the ESQ, Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS), World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Results showed that the Persian ESQ had very good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient: 0.84; Composite reliability = 0.89) and adequate test-retest reliability after four weeks (intraclass coefficient, r = .71 with 95% CI [.63, .77]). The confirmatory factor analysis model fitted the data well (χ(2)/df = 2.86, CFI = .970, SRMR = .046, PCLOSE = .85 > .05, RMSEA = .048, 90% CI [.043, .053]). Also, measurement invariance indicated the ESQ had acceptable construct validity among different groups. As for criterion-related validity, the ESQ positively correlated with scores on the WHOQOL-BREF (r = .76) and PANAS-positive affect (r = .62), and negatively correlated with the scores on the OASIS (r = −.68), DERS (r = −.39), and PANAS-negative affect (r = −72). The findings provide evidence that the ESQ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing healthy emotionality among Persian speaking individuals. The Persian ESQ can be used in psychological intervention and clinical research in Iran and other Persian-speaking countries.

"To define the contribution of CD8+ T cell responses to control of SIV reactivation during and following antiretroviral therapy (ART), we determined the effect of long-term CD8+ T cell depletion using a rhesusized anti-CD8β monoclonal antibody (mAb) on barcoded SIVmac239 dynamics on stable ART and after ART cessation in Rhesus Macaques (RMs). Among the RMs with full CD8+ T cell depletion in both blood and tissue, there were no significant differences in the frequency of viral blips in plasma, the number of SIV RNA+ cells and the average number of RNA copies/infected cell in tissue, and levels of cell-associated SIV RNA and DNA in blood and tissue relative to control-treated RM during ART. Upon ART cessation, both CD8+ T cell-depleted and control RMs rebounded in <12 days with no difference in the time to viral rebound, or in either the number or growth rate of rebounding SIVmac239M barcode clonotypes. However, effectively CD8+ T cell-depleted RMs showed a stable ~2-log increase in post-ART plasma viremia relative to controls. These results indicate that while potent anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses can develop during ART-suppressed SIV infection, these responses effectively intercept post-ART SIV rebound only after systemic viral replication, too late to limit reactivation frequency or the early spread of reactivating SIV reservoirs.",CD8+ T cells fail to limit SIV reactivation following ART withdrawal until after viral amplification.
"The lessons learned from the response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic are important to quell the opioid use disorder epidemic in the United States. This article identifies similar barriers to treatment and care that persons living with HIV experienced in the 1980s and early 1990s that are currently being experienced by persons living with opioid use disorder. In addition, this article reviews the ways in which those barriers were overcome to reduce the mortality and morbidity from HIV and highlights similar strategies that can also help persons living with opioid use disorder in this country.",Lessons Learned from the Response to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic that Can Inform Addressing the Opioid Epidemic
"OBJECTIVE: Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to exposure from respiratory droplets and aerosols generated during otologic, nasal, and oropharyngeal examinations and procedures. There have been a variety of guidelines and precautions developed to help mitigate this risk. While many reviews have focused on the personal protective equipment (PPE) and preparation guidelines for surgery in the COVID-19 era, none have focused on the more creative and unusual solutions designed to limit viral transmission. This review aims to fill that need. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Scopus. METHODS: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on September 28, 2020 using PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Scopus databases. All English-language studies were included if they proposed or assessed novel interventions developed for Otolaryngology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. RESULTS: A total of 41 papers met inclusion criteria and were organized into 5 categories (‘General Recommendations for Otolaryngologic Surgery’, ‘Equipment Shortage Solutions’, ‘Airway Procedures’, ‘Nasal Endoscopy and Skull Base Procedures’, and ‘Otologic Procedures’). Articles were summarized, highlighting the innovations created and evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Creative solutions such as application of topical viricidal agents, make-shift mask filters, three-dimensional (3-D) printable adapters for headlights, aerosol containing separation boxes, and a variety of new draping techniques have been developed to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent risk of COVID-19 exposure remains high. Thus, there is an increased need for solutions that mitigate the risk of viral transmission during office procedures and surgeries, especially given that most COVID-19 positive patients present asymptomatically. This review examines and organizes creative solutions that have been proposed and utilized in the otolaryngology. These solutions have a potential to minimize the risk of viral transmission in the current clinical environment and to create safer outpatient and operating room conditions for patients and healthcare staff.",Innovations in otorhinolaryngology in the age of COVID-19: a systematic literature review
"OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a large New York City medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department, hospital wards, and intensive care units. DESIGN: Retrospective manual medical record review. SETTING: NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. RESULTS: Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.",Characterization and clinical course of 1000 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in New York: retrospective case series

"Clinical syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by rapid spreading and high mortality worldwide. While the pathology is not yet fully understood, hyper-inflammatory response and coagulation disorders leading to congestions of microvessels are considered to be key drivers of the still increasing death toll. Until now, physical changes of blood cells have not been considered to play a role in COVID-19 related vascular occlusion and organ damage. Here we report an evaluation of multiple physical parameters including the mechanical features of five frequent blood cell types, namely erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. More than 4 million blood cells of 17 COVID-19 patients at different levels of severity, 24 volunteers free from infectious or inflammatory diseases, and 14 recovered COVID-19 patients were analyzed. We found significant changes in lymphocyte stiffness, monocyte size, neutrophil size and deformability, and heterogeneity of erythrocyte deformation and size. While some of these changes recovered to normal values after hospitalization, others persisted for months after hospital discharge, evidencing the long-term imprint of COVID-19 on the body.",Physical phenotype of blood cells is altered in COVID-19
"Relation extraction (RE) is one of the most important tasks in information extraction, as it provides essential information for many NLP applications. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual RE approach that does not require any human annotation in a target language or any cross-lingual resources. Building upon unsupervised cross-lingual representation learning frameworks, we develop several deep Transformer based RE models with a novel encoding scheme that can effectively encode both entity location and entity type information. Our RE models, when trained with English data, outperform several deep neural network based English RE models. More importantly, our models can be applied to perform zero-shot cross-lingual RE, achieving the state-of-the-art cross-lingual RE performance on two datasets (68-89% of the accuracy of the supervised target-language RE model). The high cross-lingual transfer efficiency without requiring additional training data or cross-lingual resources shows that our RE models are especially useful for low-resource languages.",Cross-Lingual Relation Extraction with Transformers
"Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma and is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An active metabolite of ciclesonide, Cic2, was recently reported to repress severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomic RNA replication. Herein, we designed and synthesized a few types of ciclesonide analogues.

These compounds are promising as novel therapeutic agents for COVID-19 that show significant antiviral activity.",Development of ciclesonide analogues that block SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication
"Today, the treatment of bacterial infections is a major challenge, due to growing rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria, complication of treatment and increased healthcare costs. Moreover, new treatments for bacterial infections are limited. Oligonucleotide aptamers are single stranded DNAs or RNAs with target-selective high-affinity feature, which considered as nucleic acid-based affinity ligands, replacing monoclonal antibodies. The aptamer-based systems have been found to be talented tools in the treatment of microbial infections, regarding their promising anti-biofilm and antimicrobial activities; they can reduce or inhibit the effects of bacterial toxins, and inhibit pathogen invasion to immune cell, as well as they can be used in drug delivery systems. The focus of this review is on the therapeutic applications of aptamers in infections. In this regard, an introduction of infections and related challenges were presented, first. Then, aptamer definition and selection, with a brief history of aptamers development against various pathogens and toxins were reviewed. Diverse strategies of aptamer application in drug delivery, as well as, the effect of aptamers on the immune system, as the main natural agents of human defense against pathogens, were also discussed. Finally, the future trends in clinical applications of this technology were discussed.",Therapeutic applications of nucleic acid aptamers in microbial infections

"Sars-CoV-2 is a new global health challenge that was declared a pandemic in March 2020. In just 6 months, the virus had infected more than 7.5 million population worldwide, and in 10 months infected over 40 million. Clinical manifestation of Sars-CoV-2 range from mild symptoms like sneezing, coughing, cold and fever to severe respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute distress respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. The virus is highly contagious and transmits through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no treatment option available to treat Sars-CoV-2. Several research groups are working to explore different aspects of virus but further research is needed to fill the knowledge gaps.

"Intrinsically disordered proteins and intrinsically disordered protein regions are highly abundant in nature. However, the quantitative and qualitative measures of protein intrinsic disorder in species with known genomes are still not available. Furthermore, although the correlation between high fraction of disordered residues and advanced species has been reported, the details of this correlation and the connection between the disorder content and proteome complexity have not been reported as of yet. To fill this gap, we analysed entire proteomes of 3484 species from three domains of life (archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes) and from viruses. Our analysis revealed that the evolution process is characterized by distinctive patterns of changes in the protein intrinsic disorder content. We are showing here that viruses are characterized by the widest spread of the proteome disorder content (the percentage of disordered residues ranges from 7.3% in human coronavirus NL63 to 77.3% in Avian carcinoma virus). For several organisms, a clear correlation is seen between their disorder contents and habitats. In multicellular eukaryotes, there is a weak correlation between the complexity of an organism (evaluated as a number of different cell types) and its overall disorder content. For both the prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the disorder content is generally independent of the proteome size. However, disorder shows a sharp increase associated with the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells. This suggests that the increased disorder content in eukaryotic proteomes might be used by nature to deal with the increased cell complexity due to the appearance of the various cellular compartments.",Orderly order in protein intrinsic disorder distribution: disorder in 3500 proteomes from viruses and the three domains of life.

"Eighty years after the first national public health institution was founded in Slovenia, the Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia (IPHRS) endeavors to meet ever-growing national demands. With the independence of Slovenia in 1991, new tasks had to be tackled, many of which were initially coupled with typical difficulties of a postcommunist country in transition. Also, increasing demands of the European Union (EU) and other international partners had to be met. The IPHRS monitors the health of the Slovenian population and its determinants and contributes to planning and implementation of population-based interventions for the better health of the whole nation. The diversity of the IPHRS activities is mirrored by the organization's internal complexity, multi-disciplinary approach, and links to various sectors. Currently, activities are organized within five centers: Center for Population Health Research; Center for Health Care Organization, Economics and Informatics; Center for Environmental Health; Center for Communicable Diseases; and Center for Health Promotion. The IPHRS is the key national institution in public health research, which is an integral part of all the areas covered by the Institute. The IPHRS also provides education programs in the field of public health. In the near future, it will be important to sustain current activities while integrating into the new program of Community action in the field of public health as well as contributing to the response to challenging public health issues in the wider context of the whole European region.

"Omicron strain is the latest variant of concern of SarsCov2 virus. The mutations in this strain in the S protein Receptor Binding domain (RBD) enable it to be more transmissible as well as escape neutralizing activity by antibodies in response to vaccine. Thus, Omicron specific strategies are need to counter infection by this strain. We investigated a collection of approved drugs shown to antagonize the binding of native strain RBD to human ACE2, for their ability to antagonize binding to Omicron strain RBD. While most of the drugs the drugs that antagonize binding to native RBD are also active for Omicron RBD but some were inactive, namely drugs that contain iodine are completely inactive against Omicron RBD. Our data strongly indicate that presence of a single iodine molecule in the drug renders it inactive against Omicron strain. Thus, there is molecular specificity of drugs for antagonizing Omicron strain RBD versus native strain RBD of this virus. Such information will pave way for specific drugs for Omicron. A pragmatic message from our data is that the often-used iodine containing mouth wash and rises may be ineffective in antagonizing receptor binding of Omicron strain.",Differential Activity of Repurposed Drugs as Receptor Binding Domain Antagonists for Omicron and Native Strains of SarsCov2
"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a key event during translation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome that allows synthesis of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and downstream proteins. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a translating mammalian ribosome primed for frameshifting on the viral RNA. The viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure that lodges at the entry to the ribosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) channel to generate tension in the mRNA and promote frameshifting, whereas the nascent viral polyprotein forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal tunnel. Biochemical experiments validate the structural observations and reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence frameshifting efficiency. Finally, we compare compounds previously shown to reduce frameshifting with respect to their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as a target for antiviral intervention.",Structural basis of ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome
"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has unprecedented implications for public health, social life, and the world economy. Because approved drugs and vaccines are not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are in high demand. To identify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days after diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days after diagnosis. Of these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 (IC(100) as low as 0.04 μg/mL), showing a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursors were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals who were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering hope for rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination.",Longitudinal Isolation of Potent Near-Germline SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Antibodies from COVID-19 Patients
"Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most frequent sex chromosome aneuploidy in males. KS diagnosis disclosure has an important impact on diagnosis acceptance and the increase in prenatal diagnostic procedures raises questions regarding communication to children/adolescents. Limited data are currently available on this issue. The aim of the study was to investigate aspects like the best timing (when), topics (how), and healthcare professional (who), which, in the opinion of both KS patients and parents, may be considered the best for diagnosis communication to KS children/adolescents. We also analyzed how participants received the communication in real life and evaluated the differences between the responses given by parents who receive KS diagnosis before or after KS patient birth regarding disclosure of KS communication. KS adult patients, KS mothers, and KS fathers, not belonging to the same family, completed a questionnaire containing quantitative measures (5 points Likert scale), open-ended questions, and multiple choice questions. Parental responses were divided according to the timing at which the communication occurred: prenatal age diagnosis (PRE-D) or postnatal age diagnosis (POST-D). A total of 41 KS adults and 77 KS parents (53 PRE-D, 24 POST-D) were recruited. Most KS patients and most POST-D parents consider that communication should be provided before 14 years of age; most PRE-D parents consider 14-18 years of age the best period for communication. We suggest that communication should occur preferably before 18 years of age by a multidisciplinary team (endocrinologists, psychologists, geneticists, and parents) and that the information should deal not only fertility and hormonal aspects but also metabolic and cognitive features.","Communicating the diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome to children and adolescents: when, how, and who?"
"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has put the global health system under the spotlight. As part of the medical workforce, nurses play an important role in interacting with and caring for patients; hence, patient-centered communication (PCC) has been emphasized in nursing education. Thus, it is worth investigating how future nurses perceive PCC and PCC-related factors under the special circumstances of COVID-19. For this purpose, the present study analyzed the mechanisms underlying the association between self-efficacy and nurse–patient communication tendency through learning burnout among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The general self-efficacy questionnaire, college students' learning burnout scale, and doctor–patient communication tendency scale were used to survey 2,231 nursing students in higher vocational medical colleges at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: General self-efficacy can directly negatively correlate with the degree of nursing students' overall nurse–patient communication, including caring, sharing, and health promotion. Dejection from learning burnout partially mediated the relationships between self-efficacy and caring and between self-efficacy and sharing; it fully mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and health promotion. Reduced personal accomplishment partially mediated between self-efficacy and caring, while it fully mediated between self-efficacy and health promotion; however, it did not play a role in the sharing model. Conclusion: Self-efficacy influences nurse–patient communication through learning burnout. Specifically, dejection and reduced personal accomplishment—two aspects of learning burnout—may compromise nursing students' willingness to engage in PCC. Thus, the importance of PCC, especially during critical health situations such as pandemics, should be emphasized further in future nursing education.",The Effect of Nursing Students' Self-Efficacy on Patient-Centered Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Effect of Learning Burnout
"TOPIC: Transplantation TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV2, commonly known as COVID-19, has been noted to manifest severe illness in certain patient populations. The clinical manifestations of this coronavirus in solid organ transplant recipients is just beginning to be described, and is not well understood. SARS-CoV2 and associated illness have been described in multiple patient populations, so far limited data has been published on the course of illness in lung transplant recipients. Here we present a case series of 26 patients who were unfortunately infected with SARS-CoV2. CASE PRESENTATION: We conducted a single-center, retrospective review of 26 lung transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV2. Data collection and patient consent were covered by OSU IRB protocol. DISCUSSION: 15 of these patients (55.5%) required admission for hypoxemia, and 4 required intubation and mechanical ventilation. 1 patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 46% (12/26) patients received dexamethasone and remdesivir, 27% (7/26) received convalescent plasma, 1 received hydroxychloroquine, and 2 received azithromycin as part of their treatments. Prior to COVID-19 infection all patients but 1 were on a standard triple immune suppression regimen with calcineurin inhibitors, steroids, and cell cycle inhibitors. Calcineurin dosing was decreased in 2 patients with severe COVID-19 and cell cycle inhibitors were reduced by 50% or held for 2 weeks 50% patients. 1 patient succumbed to COVID-19 ARDS despite ECLS support and a second 3 months after initial diagnosis due to a massive CVA. Mortality 3 months after initial diagnosis was 7.6% which is lower than other reported series. The average change in FEV1 was a loss of 0.52 liters. An average loss of 0.69 liters of FVC was noted in survivors. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is one of the largest currently reported case series of lung transplant recipients with SARS-CoV2. Overall, mortality was higher in this group than in the general population but at 7.6% 3 months after diagnosis is lowest of the single center reports published. As expected, a decrease in lung function was noted in survivors. Three was no general difference in lung function in patients who received certain treatments over others.

"Background: The goal of this study was to empirically examine the degree to which alcohol use and drinking motives changed during the first month of the pandemic and to examine individual differences associated with such changes. Methods: A U.S. nationwide survey of 500 adults was conducted; data from 201 individuals (Mage=38.98, SD=12.04, 52.2% female, 76.1% White) who endorsed current alcohol use were included in this study. Results: Paired-samples t-tests indicated that there was a significant decrease in drinking quantity [t(199)=3.74, p<.001], but no change in drinking frequency [t(198)=0.19, p=.849] overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. There were significant decreases in enhancement [t(201)=4.55, p<.001], social [t(201)=9.39, p<.001] and conformity [t(201)=3.58, p<.001] motives, but a significant increase in coping motives [t(201)=-3.71, p<.001]. Regression analyses showed that increases in enhancement [ß=0.46, p<.001] and coping [ß=0.27, p=.004] motives were significantly related to increases in drinking frequency, and increases in coping motives [ß=0.32, p=.002] were related to increases in drinking quantity. Riskier drinking prior to the pandemic was significantly related to greater increase in drinking quantity in the first month of the U.S. pandemic [ß=0.31, p<.001]. Conclusion: Results of this study provide initial support that changes in drinking motives were important predictors for changes in alcohol use during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. Contrary to anecdotal reports, drinking decreased overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic; however, those with existing risky patterns of drinking prior to the start of the U.S. pandemic were at greatest risk for drinking escalation during this time.",Early Impact of the U.S. COVID-19 Pandemic on Drinking Motives and Alcohol Use
"Background: Genetic risk factors may be related to the infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and host transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) have key role in viral cell entrance and priming. Methods: This case-control study on 147 healthy controls and 299 COVID-19 patients identified potential determinants and risk factors, including gene polymorphism involved in the severity (mild, moderate, severe) of COVID-19 disease defined by CORAD radiological criteria. Results: The ACE2 s2285666 and TMPRSS2 rs12329760 SNPs were significantly linked with COVID-19 disease severity, as were certain co-morbidities (hypertension, heart disease) and laboratory parameters. Both SNPs were amongst the highest predictors of disease severity: TMPRSS2 rs12329760 CT + TT [odds ratio (95% CI) 17.6 (5.1–61.10), ACE2 rs2285666 CT + TT 9.9 (3.2–30.9), both p < 0.001]. There was an increase in the expression of genotype frequencies of ACE2 rs2285666 and TMPRSS2 rs1232976 (TT), (CT + TT), and (T) allele in severe COVID-19 group compared to control and mild groups. Disease severity was also linked to elevated CRP, ferritin and D-dimer, and lower lymphocytes and platelet count (all p < 0.001). Conclusion: ACE2 rs2285666 and TMPRSS2 rs12329760 SNPs, in addition to lymphocyte count, CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, and hypertension, are predictors of COVID-19 disease severity.","ACE2 and TMPRSS2 SNPs as Determinants of Susceptibility to, and Severity of, a COVID-19 Infection"
"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a major public health issue. Indeed, in Italy there were 7.6 million symptomatic cases of influenza in the 2019/2020 influenza season (from October 2019 to April 2020). The aim of this study is to analyse the circulation of influenza A and B viruses in hospitalized adult and elderly patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) at Le Scotte University Hospital in Siena. METHODS: Oropharyngeal swabs were taken from SARI patients, who also completed a questionnaire recording their underlying diseases and vaccination status. Total RNA was extracted from each respiratory swab by means of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, and RT-PCR was carried out. All statistical analyses were performed by means of GraphPad Prism 6 software and STATA. RESULTS: In this study we collected 68 swabs. The average age of subjects was 79.4 years (C.I.: 76.6-82.3) and 52.9% were female. The subjects had fever (89.7%), fatigue (77%), headache (47%), cough (75%), sore throat (70.5%), and breathlessness (63.2%). We found that 20% of the 68 subjects were positive (13% for A H3N2 and 7% for A H1N1). Of the 68 subjects, 25% had received a seasonal influenza vaccine (91.6% trivalent and 8.4% quadrivalent). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is important in order to determine the timing and spread of influenza viruses and track changes in circulating influenza viruses, so as to inform seasonal influenza vaccine composition. Seasonal vaccination is considered the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications.","Epidemiological and virological surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections in the 2019/2020 season in Siena, Tuscany, Italy"
"PURPOSE: COVID 19 pandemic has brought crucial changes in the field of medical education. Ad mist university examinations in India medical schools have switched to online assessment methods to avoid student gatherings. In this context, we conducted online anatomy practical evaluation and we have aimed at quantifying the students' experience on virtual assessment. METHODS: A total of 250 first year MBBS students appeared for online anatomy practical examinations. Immediately after the completion of exams electronic feedback about their experience, in questionnaire format was obtained after getting informed consent. Their feedback was analysed and quantified. RESULTS: Completed feedback forms were submitted by 228 students. More than 50% of students favoured online anatomy spotter examinations. Only 32.8% of students were comfortable with soft parts discussion using images. For image based viva voce 61.4%, 80% & 82% of students responded that the features and orientation of osteology, radiology and embryology images, respectively, were good. For surface marking 55% of the participants preferred online verbal evaluation. Finally, more than 60% of the students preferred the conventional over online assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: The inclination of students' preference for traditional anatomy examination methods mandates adequate training of both students and teachers for virtual examination. The superiority of conventional anatomy practical examination methods is unbiased but pandemic situations warrant adequate preparedness. In the future the anatomy teaching and evaluation methodology in Indian medical schools have to be drastically reviewed in equivalence with global digitalization.",Evaluation of undergraduate medical students' preference to human anatomy practical assessment methodology: a comparison between online and traditional methods

"We introduce the well-established social scientific concept of social solidarity and its contestation, anti-solidarity, as a new problem setting to supervised machine learning in NLP to assess how European solidarity discourses changed before and after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic. To this end, we annotate 2.3k English and German tweets for (anti-)solidarity expressions, utilizing multiple human annotators and two annotation approaches (experts vs.\ crowds). We use these annotations to train a BERT model with multiple data augmentation strategies. Our augmented BERT model that combines both expert and crowd annotations outperforms the baseline BERT classifier trained with expert annotations only by over 25 points, from 58\% macro-F1 to almost 85\%. We use this high-quality model to automatically label over 270k tweets between September 2019 and December 2020. We then assess the automatically labeled data for how statements related to European (anti-)solidarity discourses developed over time and in relation to one another, before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Our results show that solidarity became increasingly salient and contested during the crisis. While the number of solidarity tweets remained on a higher level and dominated the discourse in the scrutinized time frame, anti-solidarity tweets initially spiked, then decreased to (almost) pre-COVID-19 values before rising to a stable higher level until the end of 2020.",Changes in European Solidarity Before and During COVID-19: Evidence from a Large Crowd- and Expert-Annotated Twitter Dataset

"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are used for population surveillance and might have a future role in individual risk assessment. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver results rapidly and at scale, but have widely varying accuracy. METHODS: In a laboratory setting, we performed head-to-head comparisons of four LFIAs: the Rapid Test Consortium's AbC-19(TM) Rapid Test, OrientGene COVID IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Test Cassette, and Biomerica COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. We analysed blood samples from 2,847 key workers and 1,995 pre-pandemic blood donors with all four devices. FINDINGS: We observed a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity: the IgG band of the SureScreen device and the AbC-19(TM) device had higher specificities but OrientGene and Biomerica higher sensitivities. Based on analysis of pre-pandemic samples, SureScreen IgG band had the highest specificity (98.9%, 95% confidence interval 98.3 to 99.3%), which translated to the highest positive predictive value across any pre-test probability: for example, 95.1% (95% uncertainty interval 92.6, 96.8%) at 20% pre-test probability. All four devices showed higher sensitivity at higher antibody concentrations (“spectrum effects”), but the extent of this varied by device. INTERPRETATION: The estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be used to adjust for test error rates when using these devices to estimate the prevalence of antibody. If tests were used to determine whether an individual has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in an example scenario in which 20% of individuals have antibodies we estimate around 5% of positive results on the most specific device would be false positives.

"This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns and non-lockdown phases on managers and employees in the Czech Republic in the year 2020. The Czech Republic came through the first COVID-19 wave in spring 2020 with low case numbers, but became one of the countries with the highest case incidences in the second autumn wave in Europe. The study focused on examining the differences of perceptions on digital readiness of the company, working style, and mental health variables of working personnel in lockdown and non-lockdown phases. Data was obtained by an online survey conducted monthly from March-2020 to December-2020 with the same questions each month. Collected data consisted of respondents’ basic information on the actual situation, on perceptions on company and technology and on perceptions of the own mental state in the given month, retrieved from a pool of employees and managers from the Czech Republic machine and equipment manufacturers’ industry. Statistical analysis was conducted with the Kruskal-Wallis test for ordinal variables to check for significant differences in perceptions during 2020. Results show that managers in general and telecommuting-experienced workers in particular are better able to adapt to forced home office, while telecommuting-inexperienced employees struggle to adapt positively even with increasing company support and with an increasing digital team communication.",Human Resources during COVID-19: A Monthly Survey on Mental Health and Working Attitudes of Czech Employees and Managers during the Year 2020
"This study proposes a method for calculating the appropriate medical treatment price level for foreign visitors (FVs) in Japan. Hospital management costs and foreign prices were analyzed from a market principles perspective to determine the medical treatment price. The study involved two stages: a preliminary survey and an extended survey, supplemented by an international survey. Relatively frequent diseases were selected, and the costs incurred by hospitals for the treatment of FVs were analyzed though data from three hospitals, covering 24 outpatients and 4 inpatients. Payments made by three insurance companies for overseas medical institution services for Japanese tourists with pharyngitis were analyzed. This study shows that the appropriate medical treatment prices for FVs, considering profits, were 1.22–4.26 times higher compared with prices under Japan’s public health insurance plans. Furthermore, these prices were 1.31–4.26 times higher for outpatients with pharyngitis and external injury and 1.22–3.66 times higher for inpatients with appendicitis and femoral fractures. The price of pharyngitis treatment in 12 countries was USD 20.32–158.75 per patient for Japanese tourists, whereas FVs paid 60.24 dollars (1.13 times higher than Japan’s public healthcare price) in Japan. This study shows it was appropriate to set the ideal price level for FVs higher than that for Japanese patients.",Preliminary Examination of an Appropriate Price Calculation Method and Medical Treatment Costs for Foreign Visitors in Japan
"Background: The novel coronavirus disease has caused a worldwide pandemic and has been distressing for the general population including the student population in higher education Aims: This study assesses the changes in the lives of university students, and finds an association between fear of COVID-19 and mental well-being controlled by demographic and socio-psychological factors Method: Students from one of the largest universities of Hungary were sampled responding to multidimensional questions about their life situations prior to and after social isolation measures, 4-6 weeks after the COVID-19 outbreak in Hungary The questionnaire packet included the 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for evaluating mental well-being Results: Students experienced significant negative changes after 4-6 weeks of confinement in terms of physical activity, relationship with family, friends, studies, financial situation, perceived health, future prospects, and life satisfaction Desirable changes were observed in smoking habits, cannabis use, and alcohol consumption, including binge drinking Explanatory variables of favorable mental well-being were younger age, better-perceived health status, higher life satisfaction, and more optimism about future prospects Limitations: Mental well-being was measured only during social isolation The pre-pandemic status of the students was reported retrospectively, making it prone to recall bias Conclusion: Findings suggest that the pandemic with its associated social isolation measures negatively affected students' everyday life and well-being, however, the fear of the coronavirus did not contribute to it Higher institutions should offer a wide range of measures to mitigate the downstream mental health consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in university population © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing",Mental Well-Being of University Students in Social Isolation

"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic which has affected over 12 million people across the globe. Manifestations in different organs systems are being reported regularly. Renal biopsy findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients presenting solely with acute kidney injury (AKI) have recently been described in published literature in few case reports. The findings include diffuse acute tubular injury (ATI) along with the glomerular lesion of collapsing glomerulopathy (CG). However, nephrotic syndrome as the presenting complaint of COVID-19 has not been reported widely, neither has any other glomerular lesion other than CG. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the kidney biopsy findings of two patients who had recent diagnoses of COVID-19 and presented with new-onset nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy in both patients showed ATI (as in previous reports) and distinct glomerular findings on light microscopy – that of minimal change disease (MCD) initially in one patient followed by CG in a subsequent biopsy and CG at the outset in the other patient. The electron microscopic findings in both patients were that of severe podocytopathy (diffuse and severe podocyte foot process effacement). CONCLUSION: Our cases highlight a novel clinical presentation of COVID-19 renal disease, not described before, that of new-onset nephrotic syndrome. While all published case reports describe CG as the glomerular pathology, we describe a non-CG pathology (MCD) in one of our cases, thereby adding to the repertoire of renal pathology described in association with COVID-19 patients. However, the exact mechanism by which podocyte injury or podocytopathy occurs in all such cases is still unknown. Optimal treatment options for these patients also remains unknown at this time.",Spectrum of podocytopathies in new-onset nephrotic syndrome following COVID-19 disease: a report of 2 cases
"When COVID-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020, individuals aged 65+ were identified as a higher risk population. In Florida, Governor DeSantis issued Emergency Order 20-006 to prohibit visitation to facilities housing groups of high-risk people, including assisted living facilities (ALFs). Regardless, 672 ALFs of the 3,019 in Florida had reported at least one positive case of COVID-19 by a resident or staff member as of June 30, 2020. Prior research has highlighted the differences in service delivery between nonprofit and for-profit health care providers. This manuscript fills the void of minimal research on quality of care differences among ALFs based on ownership status. We find that nonprofit ALFs have experienced fewer positive cases of COVID-19 among their residents, but less evidence of a difference between nonprofit and for-profit ALFs in terms of resident deaths. We also find evidence that the type of nursing services matters for protecting ALF residents from COVID-19.",Does Service Provider Matter During a Pandemic?

"BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with comorbidities and novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may have poor survival outcomes. However, the risk of these coexisting medical conditions in severe and non-severe cases has not been systematically reported. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to estimate the association of chronic comorbidities in severe and non-severe cases. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database (CQVIP) from the inception dates to April 1, 2020, to identify cohort studies assessing comorbidity and risk of adverse outcome. Either a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies involving 3286 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Overall, compared with the patients with non-severe cases, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases in patients with severe cases were 2.79 (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.66-4.69), 1.64 (95% CI: 2.30-1.08), 1.79 (95% CI: 1.08-2.96), 3.92 (95% CI: 2.45-6.28), and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.12), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the finding that chronic comorbidities may contribute to severe outcome in patients with COVID-19. According to the findings of the present study, old age and 2 or more comorbidities are significantly impactful to COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in China.",Comorbidities' potential impacts on severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis
"Station-based bike sharing (SBBS) not only provides commuters with direct “door-to-door” trips, but also plays a vital role in addressing the “first/last mile” challenges for public transportation system. However, there is a lack of research into portraying year-to-year changes in SBBS commuter behaviors. With five-year (from 2016 to 2020) SBBS smart card data collected in Nanjing, China, a longitudinal analysis is performed in this study to trace yearly dynamics of commuter behaviors at an individual level. We identify two sorts of SBBS commuters (i.e., SBBS-alone and SBBS-metro commuters) based on users’ spatial-temporal travel regularities. The paper finds that (i) the number of SBBS users presented a considerable fluctuation trend over a five-year span, while the proportion of SBBS commuters stabilized at an equilibrium level;(ii) the COVID-19 outbreak accelerated the decline in the proportion of female and young SBBS commuters;(iii) most SBBS commuters were recorded for only one year out of five, while the share of commuters who used SBBS for four years or more is tiny, <5%;(iv) the trip duration of SBBS-alone commuters was significantly longer than that of SBBS-metro commuters, and both showed some increase during the COVID-19 pandemic;(v) the number of non-loop trip chains was dramatically higher than that of loop trip chains, which is more prominent among SBBS-metro commuters. Our findings could provide valuable insights into the behavioral dynamics of SBBS commuters and offer recommendations on how policy makers and transportation planners could respond to these precipitate changes.",Exploring year-to-year changes in station-based bike sharing commuter behaviors with smart card data
"Face recognition has become a significant challenge today since an increasing number of individuals wear masks to avoid infection with the novel coronavirus or Covid-19. Due to its rapid proliferation, it has garnered growing attention. The technique proposed in this chapter seeks to produce unconstrained generic actions in the video. Conventional anomaly detection is difficult because computationally expensive characteristics cannot be employed directly, owing to the necessity for real-time processing. Even before activities are completely seen, they must be located and classified. This paper proposes an expanded Mask R-CNN (Ex-Mask R-CNN) architecture that overcomes these issues. High accuracy is achieved by using robust convolutional neural network (CNN)-based features. The technique consists of two steps. First, a video surveillance algorithm is employed to determine whether or not a human is wearing a mask. Second, Multi-CNN forecasts the frame's suspicious conventional abnormality of people. Experiments on tough datasets indicate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online traditional detection of anomaly systems while maintaining the real-time efficiency of existing classifiers.",A novel algorithm for mask detection and recognizing actions of human
"Introduction: Owing to the imposed burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),the need for stratifying the prognosis of patients has never been timelier. Hence, we aimed to ascertain the value of CHADS(2), CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-M (one point for male instead of female) scores to predict unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We enrolled consecutive patients above 18 years of age with confirmed COVID-19,who were admitted between February 16 and November 1, 2020. The primary endpoint of this study was three-month all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were considered four major in-hospital clinical features, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury,acute kidney injury, and mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 1,406 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were studied, among which 301(21.40%) patients died during the follow-up period. Regarding the risk scores, CHADS (2)≥1,CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc≥2, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-M≥2 were significantly associated with mortality. The performance of all risk scores for predicting mortality was satisfactory (area under the curve:0.668, 0.668, and 0.681, respectively). Appraising secondary endpoints, we found that all three risk scores were associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and mechanical ventilation. Lastly, we revealed that all risk scores were significantly correlated with serum levels of laboratory biomarkers. Conclusion: Our analysis illustrated that the CHADS(2), CHA2DS(2)-VASc, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-Mscores could aid prognostication of unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Therefore,these easily calculable methods could be integrated into the overall therapeutic strategy to guide the COVID-19 management more accurately.",Prognostic significance of CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores to predict unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19
"In this technical report, we describe a method for teaching the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) courses while also maintaining social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: a method we call 'Socially Distanced NRP ' The unique aspects of Socially Distanced NRP courses include small class sizes, keeping one group of students and their instructors together throughout the course, and creating socially distanced stations where students complete the performance skills, integrated skills, and simulation and debriefing parts of the NRP course The four socially distanced stations include airway, chest compressions, umbilical venous catheter placement, and team leader Feedback from 79 NRP students showed no difference in overall course rating between Socially Distanced NRP and standard NRP courses No cases of COVID-19 transmission were identified in the Socially Distanced NRP courses We believe that Socially Distanced NRP is a safe and effective way to provide mandatory NRP training during the COVID-19 pandemic",Socially Distanced Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP): A Technical Report on How to Teach NRP Courses During the COVID-19 Pandemic
"INTRODUCTION Thymosin α 1 (Tα1) is a peptidic biological response modifier, which plays a significant role in activating and regulating various cells of the immune system. For the above-mentioned activities it is expected to exert a clinical benefit in the treatment of diseases where the immune system is altered. AREAS COVERED Several clinical trials have been carried out with Tα1 for treatment or prevention of many different infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C, sepsis and Aspergillosis in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Data available on the use of Tα1 in infectious disease as well as a vaccine enhancer will be reviewed to possibly generate new working hypothesis. EXPERT OPINION Tα1 has been widely used in thousands of patients. Nevertheless, there are some issues that have not yet been properly addressed (i.e., dose, schedule, combination treatments, end-points to be evaluated in clinical trials). In the most recent clinical trials Tα1 has been used at higher doses than those commonly used in the past showing a direct proportionality between the dose and the effect. The safety profile of Tα1 is excellent and it is virtually devoid of toxicity.",Historical review of thymosin α 1 in infectious diseases.
"Decisions surrounding withholding and withdrawing medical interventions are common within the palliative and hospice care community. The unexpected effects of the recent pandemic ignited conversations about scarcity of resources and withholding medical interventions, based on age, among providers with limited expertise in palliative care. Using a case study and literature review, the aim of this article was to examine the best ethical considerations for resource allocation decision making that minimizes the effects of ageism. Public health ethics differs from clinical ethics by giving priority to promoting the greatest good over the protection of individual autonomy. This divide in ethics sheds light on the dangers associated with ageism. Age is often a component within clinical instruments that guide clinicians with allocation decisions. Basing decisions solely on age without evaluating health and functional status is dangerous and further propagates the discriminatory practices that fuel ageism. Previous research identified using ethical principles to guide resource allocation decisions but that may not be enough to protect the rights of older adults. A new model to guide these decisions should include advance directives and goals of care, medical indicators instead of demographics, functionality, transparent medical team, and impact of social determinants of health.",Withholding Medical Interventions and Ageism During a Pandemic: A Model for Resource Allocation Decision Making.
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly resulted in an increased level of anxiety and fear among the general population related to its management and infection spread. Due to the current unprecedented situation the normal routine life of every individual has been hindered which may cause florid mental distress. Considering the relevance of present circumstances we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on their mental well-being. Methods: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-age adults, and older adults of both genders. Study data was analyzed manually using the conventional content analysis technique. Results: A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June, 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (I) Impact of COVID-19 on mental health of the general communities;(II) Current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality;and (III) Recommendations to address mental health of communities. Generally community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need of remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address mental health needs of the community at larger scale. Conclusion: COVID-19-associated mental health consequences have hit every individual in the society. The study finding has the potentialto guide the development of context-specific innovative mental health programs to overcome the pandemic repercussions.",When COVID-19 Enters in a Community Setting: An Exploratory Qualitative Study of Community Perspectives on COVID-19 Affecting Mental Well-Being
"In this study, the effects of various quantities of sorbitol and glycerol plasticizers (0%, 30%, 45%, and 60%) on cornstarch-based film were examined to develop a novel polymer for usage with biodegradable materials. The film was prepared using the casting process. According to the test findings, the application of the plasticizer concentrations affected the thickness, moisture content, and water absorption of the film. When plasticizer concentrations were increased to 60%, the tensile stress and Young’s modulus of plasticized films dropped regardless of plasticizer type. However, the thin film with addition of 30% sorbitol plasticizer demonstrated a steady value of Young’s modulus (60.17 MPa) with an increase in tensile strength (13.61 MPa) of 46%, while the lowest combination of tensile strength and Young’s modulus is the film that was plasticized with 60% glycerol, with 2.33 MPa and 16.23 MPa, respectively. In summary, the properties and performance of cornstarch-based film were greatly influenced by plasticizer types and concentrations. The finest set of features in this research appeared in the film plasticized with 30% sorbitol, which achieved the best mechanical properties for food packaging applications.",Determination of the Tensile Properties and Biodegradability of Cornstarch-Based Biopolymers Plasticized with Sorbitol and Glycerol
"We present the largest to date of a case series of nine patients with hematological and oncological malignancies who were infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV is a novel beta-coronavirus with a high fatality rate in comorbid patients. The majority of MERS cases globally were reported from Saudi Arabia (1983 cases, including 745 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 37.5%) according to the WHO update of February 2019. All were clinically stable before acquiring the virus. Most of the cases had an active disease as relapse or refractory with three cases being neutropenic. The clinical presentation and radiological features of the patients were variable and inconsistent (Table 1). Diagnosis was confirmed with RT-PCR assays targeting upstream of the E gene and the open-reading frame gene 1a which had to be done repeatedly and required an average of 3 (with max. of 7) samples for a test to be positive (Table 2). All the patients developed respiratory failure, were admitted to the critical care unit (ICU) and required mechanical ventilation. The length of hospital stay ranged from 15 - 48, with an average of 24 days. Unfortunately, all nine patients died within days after admission to the ICU. In addition, the time from diagnosis to death has an average of 9 days ranging from 2-24 days, respectively. In conclusion, MERS CoV infection in hematology/oncology patients has a very poor prognosis regardless of the status of the underlying disease. The clinical presentation is not distinctive and confirming the diagnosis requires numerous respiratory samples. Measures to prevent nosocomial outbreaks should include proper compliance with personal protection equipment by health-care workers when managing patients with suspected and confirmed MERS-CoV infection and prompt isolation of infected patients. Future research is required to enhance our understanding of the disease and to evaluate superior diagnostic and therapeutic options.

"The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants is a challenge to the control of this pandemic. It is therefore important to collect and to analyze data related to the infection caused by different variants. We have obtained more than 3,700 COVID-19 patients between April 2020 and March 2021 from Tokat, Turkey (roughly 3,100 outpatients and close to 600 inpatients) where about 30% were infected with Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Descriptive statistics was used to characterize different subgroups. Both logistic regression and cause-specific Cox survival analysis of competing-risk was run on inpatients, to examine the impact of Alpha variant on hospitalization, on mortality and on other factors. We observed that the Alpha variant is over-represented in inpatients than outpatients so infection by Alpha variant increases the chance for hospitalization. The impact of Alpha variant on mortality seems to depend on the patient's age. For patients under age of 70, the case-fatality-rate was 0.84% (5.3%) for patients without (with) Alpha variant (Fisher's test P-value = 2.4 × 10-10). For patients above age of 70, the trend is opposite: the case-fatality-rate is 31.5% (13.6%) for patients without (with) Alpha variant (Fisher's test P-value = 0.0016). The two opposite trends would cancel each other, making other analyses such as cause-specific Cox regression and logistic regression non-significant. The Alpha variant increases the risk for hospitalization, increases the case-fatality-rate for lower age group, and decreases the case-fatality-rate for the upper age group. If the increase of case-fatality-rate in not the most senior group holds true, it should provide useful information for a vaccination planning to counter the impact of Alpha variants.",Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 increases fatality-rate for patients under age of 70 years and hospitalization risk overall
"The coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) remains an extant threat against public health on a global scale. Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 binds with the human cell receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (−9.40 kcal/mol) compared to doxycycline (−8.08 kcal/mol), chloroquine (−6.31 kcal/mol), or gentamicin (−4.83 kcal/mol) while inhibiting attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 kcal/(mol nm(2)) for tetracycline–RBD, 5.16 kcal/(mol nm(2)) for doxycycline–RBD, 5.59 kcal/(mol nm(2)) for chloroquine–RBD, and 7.02 kcal/(mol nm(2)) for gentamicin–RBD. Stronger inhibition by tetracycline is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the tetracycline–RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline binds to tyrosine and glycine residues on the viral contact interface that are known to modulate molecular recognition and bonding affinity. These RBD residues also engage in significant hydrogen bonding with the human receptor ACE2. The ability to preclude cell infection complements the anti‐inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of tetracycline; this may reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2.",Tetracycline as an inhibitor to the SARS‐CoV‐2
"Vaccination appears to be one of the effective strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the challenge of vaccine hesitancy may lower the uptake rate and affect overall vaccine efficacy. Being a low-risk group in terms of serious consequences of infection, university students may possess low motivation to get vaccinated. Therefore, an expanded Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) incorporating perceived knowledge, adaptive response, and maladaptive response was proposed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccination intention among Taiwanese university students. University students (n = 924; 575 males; mean age = 25.29 years) completed an online survey during January to February 2021. The proposed expanded PMT model was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that perceived knowledge was significantly associated with coping appraisal (standardized coefficient (β) = 0.820; p < 0.001), and coping appraisal was significantly associated with adaptive response (β = 0.852; p < 0.001), maladaptive response (β = 0.300; p < 0.001) and intention (β = 0.533; p = 0.009). Moreover, maladaptive response (β = −0.173; p = 0.001) but not adaptive response (β = 0.148; p = 0.482) was significantly and negatively associated with intention. The present study’s results demonstrated a positive path between perceived knowledge, coping appraisal, and intention among university students. Therefore, improving knowledge among this population may increase the intention to uptake the vaccine.",Expanding Protection Motivation Theory to Explain Willingness of COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake among Taiwanese University Students

"Temperature measurement at the nanoscale is of paramount importance in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and calls for the development of versatile, high-resolution thermometry techniques. Here, the working principle and quantitative performance of a cost-effective nanothermometer are experimentally demonstrated, using a molecular spin-crossover thin film as a surface temperature sensor, probed optically. We evidence highly reliable thermometric performance (diffraction-limited sub-µm spatial, µs temporal and 1 °C thermal resolution), which stems to a large extent from the unprecedented quality of the vacuum-deposited thin films of the molecular complex [Fe(HB(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)3)2] used in this work, in terms of fabrication and switching endurance (>107 thermal cycles in ambient air). As such, our results not only afford for a fully-fledged nanothermometry method, but set also a forthcoming stage in spin-crossover research, which has awaited, since the visionary ideas of Olivier Kahn in the 90's, a real-world, technological application.",Unprecedented switching endurance affords for high-resolution surface temperature mapping using a spin-crossover film

"Rich vacancies of semiconductor nanomaterials (NMs) give rise to great enhancement of their physical and chemical properties such as magnetic, catalytic, optical, etc. These NMs possessing extensive applications could inevitably enter into the environment and increase the toxic effects on organisms, so it is imperative to investigate the cytotoxicity of NMs with different types of vacancies. Here, one-dimensional cobalt selenide (CoSe2) NMs with different vacancies were synthesized through the same precursor while calcined at different temperatures (P-CoSe2 which calcined at 200 °C and N-CoSe2 which calcined at 230 °C). According to the positron annihilation spectrum, the VSeSe vacancy associate in P-CoSe2 was endowed with two positive charges, while the VCoCoCoSeSe vacancy associate in N-CoSe2 possessed four negative charges. Cell viability assays revealed that N-CoSe2 had higher toxicity to macrophages than P-CoSe2, which was attributed to higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by N-CoSe2. Further investigation showed that N-CoSe2 had higher affinity to the mitochondrion-targeting peptide, leading to its preferential distribution in the mitochondria and consequent induction of mitochondrial superoxide production. In contrast, P-CoSe2 exhibited higher affinity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting peptide, facilitating its preferential distribution in the ER and the nuclei and causing higher damage to both organelles as compared to N-CoSe2. These results demonstrated that type of surface vacancies significantly affected biodistribution of NMs in subcellular organelles, which contributed to differential biological behaviors of the NMs.",Vacancy-induced toxicity of CoSe2 nanomaterials in rat lung macrophages.
"The city of Rio de Janeiro is one of the biggest cities in Brazil. Drug gangs and paramilitary groups called \textit{mil\'icias} control some regions of the city where the government is not present, specially in the slums. Due to the characteristics of such two distinct groups, it was observed that the evolution of COVID-19 is different in those two regions, in comparison with the regions controlled by the government. In order to understand qualitatively those observations, we divided the city in three regions controlled by the government, by the drug gangs and by the \textit{mil\'icias}, respectively, and we consider a SIRD-like epidemic model where the three regions are coupled. Considering different levels of exposure, the model is capable to reproduce qualitatively the distinct evolution of the COVID-19 disease in the three regions, suggesting that the organized crime shapes the COVID-19 evolution in the city of Rio de Janeiro. This case study suggests that the model can be used in general for any metropolitan region with groups of people that can be categorized by their level of exposure.",Crime and COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro: How does organized crime shape the disease evolution?
"The increase of inequalities and the learning crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic has forced to review the role of education in the attainment of skills to learn throughout life. The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of the academic achievement on selfregulation strategies (forethought, inhibition and volitional inhibition), considering the socioeconomical context at the end of elementary school. The SRL strategies are assessed, from the perspective of students and teachers, triangulating measurement in different tasks. 67 students in their last year of primary education participated. The SRL measures were compared using robust tests considering high and low academic achievement and low and medium socioeconomic context (robust version of Welch’s test for two groups, Yuen’s test, and two-way ANOVA based on trimmed means and Winsorized variances). The academic achievement affects and significantly predicts the forethought strategy. In the low socioeconomical context, the students with a high academic achievement maximize their SRL.

"The present study investigated the pre-impressions of medical staff toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in a designated medical institution for class II infectious diseases in Sakaide, Japan using a text mining analysis. A total of 387 medical staff were surveyed on their pre-vaccination impressions toward the COVID-19 vaccine using an open-ended questionnaire from March 1st to 7th (the first survey) and from March 22nd to 28th (the second survey) at Sakaide City Hospital, Sakaide, Japan. A total of 296 people answered the question for the first time and 234 people answered for the second time among the 387 people. The vaccination rate was slightly lower for the younger generation than for the older generation. Before the first vaccination, the younger generation expressed concerns about side effects as well as a negative impact on pregnancy. However, before the second vaccination, there were fewer concerns regarding side effects and words of reassurance were also noted. Nurses expressed more opinions about side effects in both the first and second vaccinations than other medical staff. Concerns regarding side effects among medical staff decreased with the progression of COVID-19 vaccination. These data may provide useful information about the promotion of COVID-19 vaccination to the public, particularly in the young generation and women.",A Text Mining-Based Survey of Pre-Impressions of Medical Staff toward COVID-19 Vaccination in a Designated Medical Institution for Class II Infectious Diseases
"This study explored the associations between physical activity (PA) anxiety levels, and the perception of satisfaction of basic psychological needs (BPN), during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. Thus, 1,404 participants (977 women, 426 men, and one respondent preferred not to answer) ranging from 18 to 89 years old (36.4 +/- 11.7 year-old) completed a questionnaire in the period between 1st and 15th April 2021. The survey included sociodemographic data and the following validated instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to examine variation in anxiety levels and BPN satisfaction according to PA category (low, moderate, and high). Spearman's Rho correlations coefficients were used to determine the association between anxiety levels and psychological needs. Individuals presenting a higher level of PA revealed lower levels of anxiety-state (H = 20.14;p &lt; 0.01). Differences between elements from different levels of PA were found for the autonomy (H = 23.52;p &lt; 0.001), competence (H = 18.89;p &lt; 0.001), and relatedness (H = 24.42;p &lt; 0.001) psychological needs, suggesting that those who feel their BPN as more satisfied have higher levels of PA. The study found statistically significant correlations between anxiety-state and the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy (p = 0.01;r = -0.46), competence (p = 0.01;r = -0.40), and relatedness (p = 0.01;r = -0.21). These findings support the importance that PA has in the anxiety levels during social isolation, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary teams in an individual-based approach.",Higher Physical Activity Levels May Help Buffer the Negative Psychological Consequences of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic

"The pandemic crisis constitutes an unprecedented challenge for the European Union and for the Euro Area. Indeed, European institutional architecture can be viewed as being half-way between an association of sovereign states (like the United Nations, for example) and a politically integrated federation (like the United States for example). In this original construction, competences on several matters (such as economic, political, social and health issues, etc.) are shared at the European level, but also at the national and local levels in more complex ways than in fully integrated federations. To improve the resilience of the European Union to violent external shocks, the main objective of this paper is to determine to what extent these competences have to be transferred to the federal level. In this respect, we will consider whether a federal leap is necessary in several areas namely (i) monetary and fiscal policy (rules), (ii) labor markets policy and social models, migratory flows and skill shortages, and cooperation policy and (iii) renewed industrial policy and exchange rates. Despite a highly uncertain context, we outline some perspectives for the future of the European Union.",Towards a More Resilient European Union after the COVID-19 Crisis
"COVID-19 is the cause of a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. As yet, there is no available approved drug to eradicate the virus. In this review article, we present an alternative study area that may contribute to the development of therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Growing evidence is revealing further pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 related to the disregulation of inflammation pathways that seem to play a critical role toward COVID-19 complications. The NF-kB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are highly activated in acute inflammation, and the excessive activity of these pathways in COVID-19 patients likely exacerbates the inflammatory responses of the host. A group of non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) manage certain features of the inflammatory process. In this study, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of miRNAs and their connection to inflammatory responses. Additionally, we consider the link between perturbations in miRNA levels and the onset of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, previous studies published in the online databases, namely web of science, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Scopus, were reviewed for the potential role of miRNAs in the inflammatory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, we disclosed the interactions of inflammatory genes using STRING DB and designed interactions between miRNAs and target genes using Cityscape software. Several miRNAs, particularly miR-9, miR-98, miR-223, and miR-214, play crucial roles in the regulation of NF-kB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways as inflammatory regulators. Therefore, this group of miRNAs that mitigate inflammatory pathways can be further regarded as potential targets for far-reaching-therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 diseases.",Prediction and analysis of microRNAs involved in COVID-19 inflammatory processes associated with the NF-kB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways
"The aim of this study was to investigate if static and dynamic stretching exercises of the knee muscles (quadriceps and hamstring muscles) have any effects on concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torques and electromyographic amplitudes (EMG) of the antagonist muscles. Twenty healthy male athletes (age between 18-30 years) voluntarily participated in this study. All of the subjects visited the laboratory to complete the following intervention in a randomized order on 5 separate days; (a) non-stretching (control), (b) static stretching of the quadriceps muscles, (c) static stretching of the hamstring muscles, (d) dynamic stretching of the quadriceps muscles, and (e) dynamic stretching of the hamstring muscles. Static stretching exercises either for the quadriceps or the hamstring muscles were carried out at the standing and sitting positions. Subjects performed four successive repetitions of each stretching exercises for 30 seconds in both stretching positions. Similar to static stretching exercises two different stretching modes were designed for dynamic stretching exercises. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque for the non-stretched antagonist quadriceps or hamstring muscles at angular velocities of 60°/sec and 240°/sec and their concurrent electromyographic (EMG) activities were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Isokinetic peak torques of the non-stretched agonist hamstring and quadriceps muscles did not represent any significant (p > 0.05) differences following static and dynamic stretching of the antagonist quadriceps and hamstring muscles, respectively. Similarly, the EMG activities of the agonist muscles exhibited no significant alterations (p > 0.05) following both stretching exercises of the antagonist muscles. According to the results of the present study it is possible to state that antagonist stretching exercises either in the static or dynamic modes do not affect the isokinetic peak torques and the EMG activities of the non-stretched agonist quadriceps or hamstring muscles.",Effects of Static and Dynamic Stretching on the Isokinetic Peak Torques and Electromyographic Activities of the Antagonist Muscles.
"Kidney injury is a well-known complication in people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19, presentation with nephrotic syndrome has not been well described. We report on a 49-year-old black female kidney transplant recipient who presented 25 years after transplant with clinical features of nephrotic syndrome following a diagnosis of COVID-19. Histologic examination showed acute tubular injury with unremarkable glomeruli on light microscopy and diffuse foot process effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy, consistent with minimal change-like podocyte injury. Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) genetic testing confirmed 2 high-risk APOL1 alleles in the kidney donor. We speculate that COVID-19-induced systemic or local cytokine release could serve as a second hit in the presence of APOL1 risk alleles and mediate a podocytopathy manifesting as nephrotic syndrome. The presented case with minimal change-like disease, occurring in the context of the donor high-risk APOL1 genotype, extends the spectrum of clinical manifestations in COVID-19-associated nephropathy.",Minimal Change Disease With Nephrotic Syndrome Associated With Coronavirus Disease 2019 After Apolipoprotein L1 Risk Variant Kidney Transplant: A Case Report
"INTRODUCTION: Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), defined as 6 to 8cc of tidal volume per kilogram of ideal body weight (IBW), has been shown to reduce mortality and days requiring invasive ventilation when utilized in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) The degree of hypoxemia in respiratory failure experienced in the SARSCOV2 infection (COVID-19) is similar to ARDS from other respiratory pathologies;however, there appears to be notable heterogeneity in lung compliance of COVID-19 patients as well as higher rate of mortality for ARDS supported with invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 It remains unknown if lung protective tidal volume strategies confer a significant benefit for COVID-19 ARDS as they do for ARDS due to other etiologies We aim to determine if LTVV was associated with decreased mortality, ventilator days, ICU length of stay, or decreased length of hospital stay METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed with inclusion criteria of a positive COVID-19 test and intubation for non-operative indications Ideal body weight was calculated to determine whether or not each patient ever exceeded or achieved LTVV, here defined as less than 6cc/kg of ideal body weight The primary outcome was mortality The secondary outcomes were length of stay in the hospital, ICU days, and ventilator days RESULTS: A total of 75 COVID positive patients were intubated at our facility 60 (80%) of these patients died Exceeding 6cc/kg IBW LTVV trended towards more days in the ICU (p= 089) and number of days intubated (p= 148), but only increased hospital length of stay was statistically significant (p= 025) Patients who did maintain LTVV at least one day did have decreased crude odds of mortality at 0 281 (95% CI 0482-1 6395) LTVV was not correlated with fewer ICU days (p= 846), number of days intubated (p= 709), or length of hospital stay (p= 699) CONCLUSIONS: Failure to maintain LTVV was associated with increased mortality and hospital LOS It also trended toward an increase in ICU days days of mechanical ventilation Further prospective studies are required",Outcomes of low tidal volume ventilation in COVID-19 intubated patients
"Remote consultations are likely to grow in importance in the following years, especially if the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic continues. Patients’ opinions on teledermatology have already been analyzed, but a current analysis during the COVID‐19 pandemic is lacking. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the satisfaction of patients who had received dermatological advice via telephone during the COVID‐19 pandemic and to analyze their general opinion about eHealth as well as possible limitations for a broad implementation. Ninety‐one patients managed in the dermatology department using telephone consultation during the COVID‐19 pandemic were interviewed. An anonymous questionnaire, including the established quality of life questionnaire (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]), was used. It was found that men were more satisfied with telephone consultations than women (p = 0.029), educational level and age did not correlate with satisfaction (p = 0.186 and 388, respectively), and the longer the waiting time for a telephone consultation, the lower the satisfaction (p = 0.001). Grouped analysis of all participants showed that the majority (54.0% n = 38/71) were “very happy” with the telephone consultation. Higher disease burden (DLQI) was associated with lower satisfaction (p = 0.042). The main stated reasons for using telemedicine were shorter waiting times (51.6% n = 47/91) and no travel requirement (57.1% n = 47/91). Almost one‐quarter (23.1% n = 21/89) of patients would use teledermatology in the future, 17.6% (n = 16/89) would not, and 57.1% (n = 51/89) would only use it in addition to a traditional consultation with personal contact. In conclusion, most patients in the study group still preferred traditional face‐to‐face medical consultations to telephone consultations, but also desired an add‐on telemedical tool. Dermatological care using more modern telemedicine technologies than telephone conferencing is needed to better address patients’ desires, especially in times of the COVID‐19 pandemic.",Teledermatology in times of COVID‐19
"The potential for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication interference was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Fourteen-day-old broiler chickens were inoculated via eyedrop with live commercial vaccine strains of IBV and NDV alone or in combination to directly evaluate IBV and NDV replication in the trachea at 1, 3, and 5 days after vaccination. Commercial NDV vaccine strains used were B1, VG/GA, and C2. The vaccine strains of IBV tested were Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark). The NDV + Mass vaccines used were commercially manufactured combined products. The NDV + Ark vaccines used were commercial vaccines manufactured as single entity products that were administered by eyedrop to opposite eyes of each chicken. As measured by qRT-PCR, the replication of NDV strains B1, VG/GA, and C2 did not interfere with the growth of IBV Mass and Ark strain vaccines in the combined vaccine treatment groups. Combination vaccinations using B1 and VG/GA did not interfere with IBV immunity based on challenge or serum antibody production. In the C2 + Mass vaccination trial, IBV immunity after challenge was reduced, but it did not seem to be a result of reduced Mass vaccine growth or the ability of the Mass vaccine to induce serum IBV antibody. In contrast, the replication of IBV strains Mass and Ark interfered with the growth of NDV strains B1, VG/GA, and C2 as measured by qRT-PCR. However, interference with NDV replication was not reflected in a reduction in Newcastle disease challenge of immunity findings when combination Mass + NDV products manufactured by vaccine companies were tested. Moreover, NDV immunity was not compromised in two of three trials using single entity vaccines of NDV and Ark IBV vaccines manufactured separately but administered simultaneously. However, in one trial, NDV immunity was decreased where a NDV single entity product (C2) was given with an IBV single entity Ark vaccine. This finding emphasizes the importance of using manufactured combination vaccines whenever possible to avoid potential interference.",Evaluating viral interference between infectious bronchitis virus and Newcastle disease virus vaccine strains using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
"Background: Stroke is a common cause of motor disability. The recovery of upper limb after stroke is poor, with few stroke survivors regaining some functional use of the affected upper limb. This is further complicated by the fact that the prolonged rehabilitation is accompanied by multiple challenges in using and identifying meaningful and motivated treatment tasks that may be adapted and graded to facilitate the rehabilitation program. Virtual reality-based therapy is one of the most innovative approaches in rehabilitation technology and virtual reality systems can provide enhanced feedback to promote motor learning in individuals with neurological or musculoskeletal diseases. Purpose: This study investigated the effect of virtual reality-based therapy on improving upper limb functions in individuals with chronic stroke. Methods: Forty Saudi individuals with chronic stroke (6–24 months following stroke incidence) and degree of spasticity ranged between 1, 1 + and 2 according to Modified Ashworth Scale were included in this study. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups, experimental and control, with the experimental group undertaking a conventional 1-h functional training program, followed by another hour of virtual reality-based therapy using Armeo Spring equipment and the control group received 2 h of a conventional functional training program. The treatment program was conducted three times per week for three successive months. The change in the scores of Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), WMFT-Time (time required to complete the test) and Hand Grip Strength (HGS) were recorded at baseline and after completion of the treatment. Parametric (paired and unpaired t-tests) non-parametric (Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney tests) statistical tests were used to identify the differences within and between groups (experimental group and control group) and evaluation times (pre- and immediately post-treatment). Results: Both groups showed significant differences (all, P < 0.05) in all measured variables after 3 months of the treatment. Individuals with stoke in the experimental group had a better improvement in ARAT (P < 0.01), WMFT (P < 0.01) and WMFT-Time (P < 0.01) scores after completion of the treatment compared to the control group. No significant difference in HGS scores was detected between groups after completion of the treatment (P = 0.252). Conclusion: The use of combined treatment of virtual reality-based therapy and conventional functional training program is more effective for improving upper limb functions in individuals with chronic stroke than the use of the conventional program alone.",The Effect of Virtual Reality-Based Therapy on Improving Upper Limb Functions in Individuals With Stroke: A Randomized Control Trial
"Hypertension has been listed in several case series and retrospective cohorts as a potential risk factor for the incidence and severity of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-associated disease (COVID-19). The debate is noteworthy because almost one billion people around the globe are estimated to have hypertensive diseases, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Considering the SARS-CoV-2's high infectivity rates, a possible interaction between COVID-19 and hypertension is worrisome. Additionally, antihypertensive drugs, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, could also influence the natural course of COVID-19 infection. Not only can these associations hold from an epidemiologic standpoint, a mechanistic scenario possibly exists. Hypertension and antihypertensive drugs can increase the expression of transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, the entry target of the viruses, thus facilitating infectivity. On the other hand, an increase in ACE-2 could be protective considering the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic effects of the ACE-2-angiotensin 1-7/Mas pathway. So far, little is known about the whole picture. Observational studies appear to indicate at least a twofold increased risk of mortality for hypertensive patients with COVID-19; however, the previous and continued use of RAAS inhibitors may be protective in this subgroup of patients. The scarcity of randomized clinical trials precludes evidence-based decision-making. At least one randomized study in a non-specified sub-analysis demonstrated no relationship between an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and incidence or severity of the disease. It is reflected mainly by observational studies and, therefore, by international cardiology societies' guidelines, which state that antihypertensive drugs, particularly RAAS inhibitors, should not be discontinued unless necessary on a case-by-case basis.",COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension
"The commonest way of killing in the UK is by a sharp instrument. Knight reported in 1975 that it is impossible to discern with any degree of certainty the degree of force used to create a stab wound. Despite this, expert witnesses continue to approximate the degree of force used for their reports and evidence in court. It is usually subjectively categorized as mild, moderate or severe, based solely on the examination of the wound. We undertook a study considering forces generated in a range of blunt trauma actions, using a novel force plate dynamometer to measure the peak forces obtained by adult male and female volunteers. We then studied forces generated by stabbing skin simulants and porcine samples with knives and screwdrivers. Men generated more force than women during stabbings which was found to be equivalent to somewhere between the blunt trauma actions of pushing a button to a single-handed push. When asked to stab using what they thought was mild, moderate and severe force, although volunteers were able to actively decide the force used, the actual force was found to be influenced by the weapon, sex of the individual, hand used and biological/anatomical site penetrated. This study shows that the forces generated by volunteers in mild, moderate and severe stabbing tests in almost all cases were significantly greater than the forces required for skin penetration. We suggest that the use of subjective force scales is inappropriate. Rather than use of a subjective scale, we suggest that the force required in any stabbing requires investigation in four areas: the tip radius of the weapon, minimal force required for penetration, the sex of the assailant and whether the force required for penetration is greater than that that can be generated by a person stabbing. This allows for the use of an evidence-based two-tier scale to suggest the force required.

"We generated CD4+ T cell lines (TCLs) reactive to either SARSCoV-2 spike (S) or membrane (M) proteins from unexposed naive T cells from six healthy donor volunteers to understand in fine detail whether the S and M structural proteins have intrinsic differences in driving antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses. Having shown that each of the TCLs were antigen-specific and antigen-reactive, single cell mRNA analyses demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S and M proteins drive strikingly distinct molecular signatures. Whereas the S-specific responses are virtually indistinguishable from those responses induced by other viral antigens (e.g. CMV), the M protein-specific CD4+ TCLs have a transcriptomic signature that indicate a marked suppression of interferon signaling, characterized by a downregulation of the genes encoding ISG15, IFITM1, IFI6, MX1, STAT1, OAS1, IFI35, IFIT3 and IRF7 (a molecular signature which is not dissimilar to that found in severe COVID-19). Our study suggests a potential link between the antigen specificity of the SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells and the development of specific sets of adaptive immune responses. Moreover, the balance between T cells of significantly different specificities may be the key to understand how CD4+ T cell dysregulation can determine the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.",Antigenic determinants of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell lines reveals M protein-driven dysregulation of interferon signaling
"Excessive inflammation during bacterial and viral infections is destructive to the host and involves elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines. It is especially deleterious in organs with space constraints such as lung and the CNS. Indeed, a number of viruses that infect lungs, such as avian influenza virus, SARS-associated coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, elicit a very high level of proinflammatory cytokines; however, it is unclear what triggers their production. In this study, we show that IL-17 commonly produced during viral infection specifically augments a proinflammatory response by directly synergizing with antiviral signaling. Costimulation of primary human fibroblasts with IL-17 greatly enhanced respiratory syncytial virus-induced or synthetic dsRNA-based viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-induced expression of proinflammatory genes without affecting expression of IFN-β-stimulated or IFN-stimulated genes. Knockdown of expression of known mediators of the antiviral signaling pathway revealed that the IL-17-poly(I:C) synergy depends on the presence of the transcriptional factors RelA and IFN regulatory factor 3 and IκB kinases. Moreover, this synergy was blocked by an IκB kinase inhibitor, BAY 11-7082. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind IL-17-dependent immunopathology observed in viral infections.",IL-17 boosts proinflammatory outcome of antiviral response in human cells.
"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic surgery for patients with ectopic pregnancies in unusual locations. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective case series of 31 patients from 6 weeks to 10 weeks postmenstrual who were referred for diagnosis and treatment and suspected of having an unruptured cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) or cornual pregnancy (CP). The diagnosis was confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound, and all of the patients underwent laparoscopic management. RESULTS A diagnosis of CSP or CP was confirmed in all of the patients during the laparoscopic procedure. None of the patients required conversion to laparotomy. The total operative time ranged from 40 minutes to 120 minutes. The total blood loss was limited, ranging from 30 mL to 200 mL. All of the women tolerated the operation well and had uneventful recoveries. CONCLUSION When performed by a well-trained gynecologist, laparoscopy appears to be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of unruptured CSP or CP.",Laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancies in unusual locations.
"The disease spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from no symptoms to multisystem failure and death. Characterization of virus-specific immune responses to severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to understanding disease pathogenesis, but few studies have evaluated T cell immunity. In this issue of the JCI, Sattler et al. sampled blood from subjects with COVID-19 and analyzed the activation and function of virus antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. T cells that failed to respond to peptides from the membrane, spike or nucleocapsid proteins were more common in subjects who died. In those whose T cells had the capacity to respond, older patients with more co-morbidity had larger numbers of activated T cells compared with patients that had fewer risk factors, but these cells showed impaired IFN- production. This cross-sectional study relates activated T cell responses to patient risk factors and outcome. However, T cell response trajectory over the disease course remains an open question.",Are T cells helpful for COVID-19: the relationship between response and risk.

"Guangdong province, located in South China, is an important economic hub with a large domestic migrant population and was among the earliest areas to report COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan. We conducted a cross-sectional, age-stratified serosurvey to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after the emergence of COVID-19 in Guangdong. We tested 14,629 residual serum samples that were submitted for clinical testing from 21 prefectures between March and June 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a magnetic particle based chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and validated the results using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. We found 21 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, resulting in an estimated age- and sex-weighted seroprevalence of 0.15% (95% CI: 0.06–0.24%). The overall age-specific seroprevalence was 0.07% (95% CI: 0.01–0.24%) in persons up to 9 years old, 0.22% (95% CI: 0.03–0.79%) in persons aged 10–19, 0.16% (95% CI: 0.07–0.33%) in persons aged 20–39, 0.13% (95% CI: 0.03–0.33%) in persons aged 40–59 and 0.18% (95% CI: 0.07–0.40%) in persons ≥60 years old. Fourteen (67%) samples had pseudovirus neutralization titers to S-protein, suggesting most of the IgG-positive samples were true-positives. Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was low, indicating that there were no hidden epidemics during this period. Vaccination is urgently needed to increase population immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong Province, China between March to June 2020"

"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for disease monitoring is highly promising, but requires consistent methodologies that incorporate predetermined objectives, targets, and metrics. We demonstrate a comprehensive metagenomics-based approach for global surveillance of antibiotic resistance in sewage, enabling assessment of: 1) which antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are shared across regions/communities; 2) which ARGs are discriminatory; and 3) factors associated with overall trends including antibiotic concentrations in sewage. Across an internationally-sourced transect of sewage samples collected using a centralized, standardized protocol, ARG relative abundances (16S rRNA gene-normalized) were highest in Hong Kong and India and lowest in Sweden and Switzerland, reflecting national policy, measured antibiotic concentrations, and metal resistance genes. Asian versus European/US resistomes were distinct, with macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, phenicol, quinolone, and tetracycline versus multidrug resistance ARGs being discriminatory, respectively. Sales data were not predictive of antibiotics measured in sewage, emphasizing need for direct measurements. The WBE approach defined herein demonstrates multi-site comparability and sensitivity to local/regional factors.",Wastewater Based Epidemiology Enabled Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance
"Several studies showed that frailty was a predictor of in-hospital death in older adults with COVID-19. The mechanisms through which frailty increases the severity of COVID-19 are several, including immunosenescense and dysregulated inflammation. Whether individuals affected by frailty exhibit a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an open question. Here we report the case series of 40 older persons that in February 2020, before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Italy, went together on a winter holiday. Back home, 7 of them developed influenza-like symptoms and one was hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Between May and July, the seniors were offered the possibility to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. Twenty-seven of them accepted: 13 had a positive serological test whereas no active infection was found. Comparing the characteristics of those who tested positive and the others, we found that the former group was frailer, exhibiting higher Clinical Frailty Scale scores.",Why data on frailty and SARS-CoV-2 infection are basic to progress
"Purpose Many patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) require prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation may amplify ventilator-associated complications and extend resource utilization. A better understanding of prognostic indicators could help in the planning and distribution of resources, particularly in resource-limited areas. We analyzed laboratory studies of intubated COVID-19 patients with the goal of identifying biomarkers that may predict extubation success and survival to discharge. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on all COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation between January 3, 2020, and January 7, 2020, in a single academic tertiary care center in Northeastern New York State. The electronic medical record was used to collect 14 laboratory variables at three time points: admission, intubation, and extubation (including terminal extubation) for all intubated intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated for COVID-19. Mean laboratory values were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed with the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results Seventy-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty-three patients were male. The mean age was 61 years. The overall mortality was 50%. On admission, intubated patients who survived had significantly higher platelet counts (p=0.024), and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC; p=0.047). Notably, ferritin (p=0.018) and aspartate transaminase (AST; p=0.0045) levels were lower in survivors. At the time of intubation, survivors again had a higher platelet count (p=0.024) and ALC (p=0.037) levels. They had a lower D-dimer (p=0.0014), ferritin (p=0.0015), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; p=0.0145), and AST (p=0.018) compared to intubated patients who died. At extubation, survivors had higher platelet count (p=0.0002), ALC (p=0.0013), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR; p=0.0024). Survivors had lower d-dimer (p=0.035), ferritin (p=0.0012), CRP (p=0.045), LDH (p=0.002), AST (p<0.001), and ALK (p=0.0048). Conclusions Biomarkers associated with increased risk of mortality include platelet count, ALC, lymphocyte percentage, NLR, D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), AST, alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALK). This study provides additional evidence that these biomarkers have prognostic value in patients with severe COVID-19. The goal is to find objective surrogate markers of disease improvement or success of extubation. When considered within the larger body of data, it is our hope that a mortality risk calculator can be generated for intubated COVID-19 patients.",Biomarkers Predictive of Extubation and Survival of COVID-19 Patients
"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a global health problem whose impact has been significantly felt in South Africa. With the global spread increasing and infecting millions, containment efforts by countries have largely focused on lockdowns and social distancing to minimise contact between persons. Social distancing has been touted as the best form of response in managing a rapid increase in the number of infected cases. In this paper, we present a deterministic model to describe the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to data from March 5 to April 13, 2020, on the cumulative number of infected cases, and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing is presented. The model shows that with the levels of social distancing under the initial lockdown level between March 26 and April 13, 2020, there would be a projected continued rise in the number of infected cases. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lockdown. It is shown that relaxation of social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases whilst an increase in the level of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. The model results accurately predicted the number of cases after the initial lockdown level was relaxed towards the end of April 2020. These results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phase of the epidemic.",Modelling the Potential Impact of Social Distancing on the COVID-19 Epidemic in South Africa
"Tracking and quantifying the abundance and location of cells in the developing brain is essential in neuroscience research, enabling a greater understanding of mechanisms underlying nervous system morphogenesis. Widely used experimental methods to quantify cells labeled with fluorescent markers-such as immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and expression of transgenes via stable lines or transient in utero electroporations-depend upon accurate and consistent quantification of images. Current methods to quantify fluorescently-labeled cells rely on labor-intensive manual counting approaches, such as the Fiji plugin Cell Counter, which requires custom macros to enable higher-throughput analyses. Here, we present RapID Cell Counter, a semi-automated cell-counting tool with an easy-to-implement graphical user interface, that facilitates quick and consistent quantifications of cell density within user-defined boundaries that can be divided into equally-partitioned segments. Compared to the standard manual counting approach, we show that RapID matched accuracy and consistency, and only required â¼10% of user time relative to manual counting methods, when quantifying the distribution of fluorescently-labeled neurons in mouse in utero electroporation experiments. Using RapID, we recapitulated previously published work focusing on two genes, Srgap2 and Cul5, important for projection neuron migration in the neocortex and used it to quantify projection neuron displacement in a mouse knockout model of Rbx2 Moreover, RapID is capable of quantifying other cell types in the brain with complex cell morphologies, including astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons. We propose RapID as an efficient method for neuroscience researchers to process fluorescently-labeled brain images in a consistent, accurate, and high-throughput manner.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMost studies in neuroscience rely on imaging to elucidate key neurodevelopmental processes including cell migration and proliferation. Many imaging techniques, including in utero electroporation and immunohistochemistry, produce multitudes of images that require accurate quantification, often via labor-intensive manual counting by multiple individuals that may delay follow-up experiments. To address this problem, we developed RapID, an efficient and semi-automated cell counting software platform, that reduces the time spent to 1/10th compared to one of the most popular quantification methods used for imaging studies today. RapID is flexible across imaging platforms and easily implemented through a graphical user interface.",RapID Cell Counter: Semi-automated and mid-throughput estimation of cell density within diverse cortical layers
"In accordance with the new social order required by the new type corona virus, several areas such as education, health, culture and transportation continue to transform with the social policies followed by states. The states, where the virus has spread and affected the whole world, make new regulations in the context of social policy and develop new models. In this case, it is seen that a link is established between politics and biological life. Depending on biological processes, governments focus on the needs of the era and social life. Thus, it is observed that a ""bio-political"" transformation is under construction. After the Covid 19 pandemic, all governments have imposed new social regulations so that they can implement education policies as an effective social government policy. In this regard, the statements that it would be the right decision to interrupt face-to-face education for a while in educational institutions came to the fore. In addition, the necessity of taking social measures in order not to keep students away from education and to ensure the continuity of education was also among the issues emphasized. From this point of view, the aim of the study is to evaluate and interpret the requests submitted by university students studying in our country during the Covid 19 pandemic to the hotline established by the TRNC Higher Education and Foreign Relations Office (YODID). The study was carried out with a qualitative method and uses a case study design. Hotline reports were used as data collection tools. Findings obtained were interpreted by descriptive analysis.

"OBJECTIVES: Dentistry is stuck between the one-size-fits-all approach towards diagnostics and therapy employed for a century and the era of stratified medicine. The present review presents the concept of precision dentistry, i.e., the next step beyond stratification into risk groups, and lays out where we stand, but also what challenges we have ahead for precision dentistry to come true. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative literature review. RESULTS: Current approaches for enabling more precise diagnostics and therapies focus on stratification of individuals using clinical or social risk factors or indicators. Most research in dentistry does not focus on predictions — the key for precision dentistry — but on associations. We critically discuss why both approaches (focus on a limited number of risk factors or indicators and on associations) are insufficient and elaborate on what we think may allow to overcome the status quo. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging more diverse and broad data stemming from routine or unusual sources via advanced data analytics and testing the resulting prediction models rigorously may allow further steps towards more precise oral and dental care. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Precision dentistry refers to tailoring diagnostics and therapy to an individual; it builds on modelling, prediction making and rigorous testing. Most studies in the dental domain focus on showing associations, and do not attempt to make any predictions. Moreover, the datasets used are narrow and usually collected purposively following a clinical reasoning. Opening routine data silos and involving uncommon data sources to harvest broad data and leverage them using advanced analytics could facilitate precision dentistry.","Precision dentistry—what it is, where it fails (yet), and how to get there"
"Patients with End Stage Kidney Disease requiring dialysis are exceedingly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection with high hospitalization rates and mortality. Despite this risk, little is known about real world dialysis patient SARS-CoV-2 vaccination acceptance. Surveys of the general population suggest significant vaccine hesitancy and high potential for refusal. From January 27th to March 12th, 2021, the University of Virginia (UVA) Health System, in partnership with the Virginia Department of Health / Blue Ridge Health District (BRHD) provided on-site mobile vaccination clinics at 12 UVA dialysis sites. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate vaccine acceptance and evaluate factors associated with refusal. Of 859 dialysis patients with complete vaccination data, 80% received at least one dose of vaccine and 87% of these vaccinations were provided by the UVA/BRHD partnership. The overall patient refusal rate was low at 14%. Patients refusing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were more likely to be female, younger and missing a documented flu vaccination during the 2020-2021 season. Attributes such as race or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 were not significantly associated with vaccine refusal. In conclusion, dialysis patients in our program were surprisingly likely to accept vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Identifying attributes associated with refusal may help target populations at high risk of vaccine refusal.",Results of an Academic Dialysis Program-Wide SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Effort
"Abstract A study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among public community and health care workers in Alzintan City, Libya. During the period from 2/4/2020 to 18/5/2020, a total of 219 blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collection of samples were divided in two categories; random samples from public community and samples from health care workers belong to two Governmental hospitals and one private clinic. One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test was used. Out of the 219 samples tested, 6 (2.74%) samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. All health-care workers were tested negative. All positive cases were females and 5 of them aged between 44 to 75 years and one aged 32 years. The prevalence in young females ([≤]40 years) was 1.4% in total young females tested in the study and 1.75% in young females taken from public community. The prevalence in older females aged ( 40 years), was 11.1% in total females tested and 13.9% in females taken from public community. In conclusion, the preliminary investigation of SARS-CoV-2 revealed considerable prevalence in Alzintan City although the disease seems to be in its mild form.

"With a small, circular and non-protein coding RNA genome, viroids are the smallest infectious agents. They invade plants, which in turn may develop symptoms. Since their discovery about 50 years ago, more than thirty viroids have been reported and classified using as species demarcation less than 90 per cent sequence identity on the overall genome and evidence of biological divergence with respect to the closest related viroids. In the last few years, new viroids have been identified that infect latently their (frequently) woody hosts and have a narrow experimental hosts range, complicating and slowing down studies on their biology. As a consequence, several viroids are still waiting for classification. Moreover, the number of new viroids is expected to increase in the next years due to the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies with diagnostics purposes. Therefore, establishment of reliable species demarcation criteria mainly based on molecular features of viroids is needed. Here, viroid classification is reassessed and a scheme based on pairwise sequence identity matrices is developed. After identifying a threshold pairwise identity score (PWIS) for each viroid genus, to be used as a species demarcation criterion, we show that most of those yet unclassified viroids can be assigned to a known or to a new species, thus limiting the need for additional biological evidence to only a few more complex situations. The advantages of this PWIS-based method are that the proposed identity thresholds for species demarcations are not arbitrarily established and evidence for biological divergence is not mandatory. Importantly, the current classification is not essentially modified. A protocol for a tentative fast classification of new viroids according to the proposed approach is also provided.",Reassessing species demarcation criteria in viroid taxonomy by pairwise identity matrices
"The use of remote working options has saved jobs and reduced health risks inherent to the rise of COVID-19. The opportunity to use telework has allowed organizations to engage in operational activities by leveraging virtual teams' potential. Organizations offering workers to work remotely have become financial salvation for many workers during the pandemic, significantly since the pandemic impacted the U.S. economy so severely that more than since more than 57 million American workers have filed for unemployment government benefits in just 2020. While having a telework option is an assurance of organizational sustainability or continual employment, it represents a unique opportunity for exploration for employees, supervisors, and organizations attempting to adapt to this evolving level of complex change. This paper uses applied qualitative focus group research from a process consulting to explore the values and barriers that telework for a real estate title organization called XRO.",Organizational Dynamics of the Rise of Telework as an Adaptive Response to a Global Pandemic
"BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study analyses the impact of the first two pandemic waves on surgical urgencies/emergencies and their consequences on an entire provincial hospital network’s surgical activities. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of urgent/emergent surgical admissions and interventions in the Autonomous Province of Trento›s hospital network were collected from the internal common electronic database. The investigation periods were March-May 2019 (reference period), March-May 2020 (phase-I), June - August 2020 (phase-II), and October - December 2020 (phase-III). The same data were divided and grouped for the six most represented diagnoses. RESULTS: The number of admissions for surgical emergencies in the studied periods showed a sinusoidal trend. In the reference period of 2019, 957 patients were admitted in urgency, while in the three pandemic phases, urgent admissions were 511, 888 and 633 respectively (-47% in phase I, - 8% in phase II, -34% in phase III). This trend was also observed by stratifying admissions for single disease, except for gastrointestinal perforations and pancreatitis, which showed a slight increasing trend in phase-I. Among the studied population, the surgical rate was 35.2% in phase-I and 34.3% in phase-III; these data were significantly higher than in 2019 (25.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the COVID pandemic on surgical emergencies and urgencies (SUEs) was mainly indirect, manifesting itself with a significant reduction in the number of surgical admissions, particularly in phases-I and-III. Conversely, in the same phases, the surgical rate showed a significant increase compared to 2019.

"The disease severity of COVID-19, especially in the elderly and patients with co-morbidities, is characterized by hypercytokinemia, an exaggerated immune response associated with an uncontrolled and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokine mediators (cytokine storm). Flavonoids, important secondary metabolites of plants, have long been studied as therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases due to their cytokine-modulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential role of flavonoids in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for COVID-19 disease, particularly those related to inflammation and immunity. The immunomodulatory ability of flavonoids, carried out by the regulation of inflammatory mediators, the inhibition of endothelial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors (TLRs) or bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), and the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the ability of flavonoids to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), neutralize 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or to affect gut microbiota to maintain immune response, and the dual action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) may potentially also be applied to the exaggerated inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the previously proven effects of flavonoids in other diseases or on the basis of newly published studies associated with COVID-19 (bioinformatics, molecular docking), it is reasonable to assume positive effects of flavonoids on inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19. This review highlights the current state of knowledge of the utility of flavonoids in the management of COVID-19 and also points to the multiple biological effects of flavonoids on signaling pathways associated with the inflammation processes that are deregulated in the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of agents, including naturally occurring substances such as flavonoids, represents great approach potentially utilizable in the management of COVID-19. Although not clinically investigated yet, the applicability of flavonoids against COVID-19 could be a promising strategy due to a broad spectrum of their biological activities.",Flavonoids against the SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm

"Family-Vicsek scaling is one of the most essential scale-invariant laws emerging in surface-roughness growth of classical systems. In this Letter, we theoretically elucidate the emergence of the Family-Vicsek scaling even in a strongly interacting quantum bosonic system by introducing a surface-height operator. This operator is comprised of a summation of local particle-number operators at a simultaneous time, and thus the observation of the surface roughness in the quantum many-body system and its scaling behavior are accessible to current experiments of ultracold atoms.",Family-Vicsek Scaling of Roughness Growth in a Strongly Interacting Bose Gas
"Investigating immune suppression mechanisms in cancer may inform on strategies to overcome resistance to current immunotherapies, common across solid tumor types but near ubiquitous in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A recent study by Kemp and colleagues in Cancer Research identified an immuno-modulatory axis originating in tumor-associated macrophages whereby macrophage-derived apolipoprotein E (APOE) activates NF-&#954;B in tumor cells in a paracrine manner, inducing expression of immunosuppressive chemokines. In contrast, APOE promotes antitumor immunity in other cancer types including melanoma, highlighting the context dependency of APOE signaling and its impact on the tumor microenvironment. As new immunotherapy approaches increasingly aim to modulate both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments of the PDAC immune milieu, identification of specific mechanisms that foster macrophage-mediated immune suppression may facilitate the development of effective strategies that enable the immune system to tackle these tumors.See related article by Kemp et al., p. 4305.",Lipid Carriers in Cancer: Context Matters
"Particle concentration in a sitting person's breathing zone can be influenced by human movement around the person, and the transient and continuous effects may differ. In this study, a set of full-scale experiments was conducted to sample the nanoparticle concentration in the breathing zone of a sitting thermal breathing manikin (STBM). The transient fluctuation of the nanoparticle concentration was recorded continuously and analyzed. The results showed that when a manikin moved (at 1 m/s) past the STBM, the nanoparticle concentration in the STBM's breathing zone decreased and reached its lowest after the standing manikin had passed, decreasing 37.6 (±5.7) % compared with the peak value. The average concentration in the STBM's breathing zone during influence periods was 5.18 (±0.99) % less than that during non-influence Periods (NP). This finding reflected the fact that the transient inhalation (over several seconds) of the STBM may be reduced by manikin movement. On the other hand, the exposure of the STBM increased 2.88 (±1.24) % when there was a continuously moving manikin compared with the stable state in a 10-min observation. This finding may be explained by the fuller mix of indoor air and nanoparticles caused by manikin movement, as well as the increase of nanoparticle suspension time. The difference in the transient and continuous effects of the manikin movement on the STBM's exposure shows the importance of considering these effects separately in different scenarios.",Transient and continuous effects of indoor human movement on nanoparticle concentrations in a sitting person's breathing zone
"Recently, size-controlled pesticide microcapsule (MC) delivery systems have played an important role in precision farming development; however, the potential environmental hazards of MCs with different particle sizes have not been fully characterized. In this study, we prepared a series of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC)-MCs with nano and micron-scale capsule sizes (average diameters of 209.4 nm, MC-N; 2.41 µm, MC-S; 4.87 µm, MC-M; and 12.41 µm, MC-L). The assessment results showed that the release and sedimentation behavior of LC-MCs in water and toxicity to zebrafish at three life stages were all particle size-dependent. As the diameter distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale (~27 µm), the capsules released more slowly and sunk more quickly in water. In addition, micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in significantly less fish mortality and malformations of larvae and embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The highest accumulation of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae suggested that the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would pose unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms. The obvious toxicological differences of LC-MCs toward aquatic organisms implies that regulating MC production in an appropriate size range is an important prerequisite for achieving efficient but safe pesticide applications.",Lambda-cyhalothrin-loaded nanocapsules pose an unacceptable acute toxicological risk to zebrafish (Danio rerio) at the adult and larval stages but present an acceptable risk to embryos.
"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a potential inhibitor of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). ACE2 and its co-expressed proteins are SARS-CoV-2 receptors, which have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and considered as the key target of SARS-CoV-2 in entering target cells. Here, network pharmacology was used to investigate the mechanism by which CGA affected COVID-19. A total of 70 potential targets related to the treatment of COVID-19 were obtained, among which NFE2L2, PPARG, ESR1, ACE, IL6, and HMOX1 might be the main potential targets. Finally, CGA and potential target proteins were scored by molecular docking, and the prediction results of network pharmacology were preliminarily verified. Moreover, CGA had potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity via integrating three common receptors in clinical practice compared with clinical trial drugs registered for the treatment of COVID-19, as shown by molecular docking. The mechanism of CGA against COVID-19 was initially investigated using network pharmacology, followed by molecular docking.","Chlorogenic acid, a natural product as potential inhibitor of COVID-19: virtual screening experiment based on network pharmacology and molecular docking"
"BACKGROUND: Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) represent a particularly vulnerable group to the threats posed by COVID-19. However, they have not yet been given a voice on how their living conditions have been affected by COVID-19. AIMS: This study aims to report the impact on people with IDD of COVID-19 and the response measures applied in Spain during the lockdown. METHOD: Data on 582 individuals with IDD were collected through a survey. Seven open questions were included to capture the perspectives of people with IDD on COVID-19 and its consequences. Content analysis was performed to identify themes and categories across participant responses. Chi-square tests were used to analyze the relationship between reporting a specific category and participants’ characteristics. RESULTS: Supports have been conditioned by the living context. People living in specific settings had fewer natural supports, while those living with their family relied heavily on it. Participants also lacked supports considered necessary. It is worth stressing that persons with IDD have also provided support to others. CONCLUSIONS: Although people with IDD have generally received the assistance they need during the lockdown, it must be ensured that appropriate supports are provided regardless of the context in which they live.",Supports for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities during the COVID-19 Pandemic from their Own Perspective
"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has previously never been identified with humans, thereby creating devastation in public health. The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of the nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides “RIRGGDGKMKDL” and “AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG” were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and nonallergenic property. Two CD8(+) and Three CD4(+) T cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a nonallergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the Toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing the pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.",Attenuated Subcomponent Vaccine Design Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein RNA Binding Domain: In Silico Analysis
"The rapid growth in cases of COVID-19 has threatened to overwhelm healthcare systems in multiple countries In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) ""mitigation"", which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) ""suppression"", aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches We simulated a range of different non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months)",COVID-19 herd immunity strategies: walking an elusive and dangerous tightrope
"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an inflammatory cytokine storm and acute lung injury. Currently there are no effective antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we demonstrate that 2019 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (CoV2-S1) induces high levels of NF-κB activations, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mild epithelial damage, in human bronchial epithelial cells. CoV2-S1-induced NF-κB activation requires S1 interaction with human ACE2 receptor and early activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and associated unfolded protein response (UPR), and MAP kinase signalling pathways. We developed an antagonistic peptide that inhibits S1-ACE2 interaction and CoV2-S1-induced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The existing FDA-approved ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylburic acid (4-PBA), and MAP kinase inhibitors, trametinib and ulixertinib, ameliorated CoV2-S1-induced inflammation and epithelial damage.

"The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns in countries across the world, changing the lives of billions of people. The United Kingdom's first national lockdown, for example, restricted people's ability to socialize and work. The current study examined how changes to socializing and working during this lockdown impacted ongoing thought patterns in daily life. We compared the prevalence of thought patterns between two independent real-world, experience-sampling cohorts, collected before and during lockdown. In both samples, young (18 to 35 y) and older (55+ y) participants completed experience-sampling measures five times daily for 7 d. Dimension reduction was applied to these data to identify common ""patterns of thought."" Linear mixed modeling compared the prevalence of each thought pattern 1) before and during lockdown, 2) in different age groups, and 3) across different social and activity contexts. During lockdown, when people were alone, social thinking was reduced, but on the rare occasions when social interactions were possible, we observed a greater increase in social thinking than prelockdown. Furthermore, lockdown was associated with a reduction in future-directed problem solving, but this thought pattern was reinstated when individuals engaged in work. Therefore, our study suggests that the lockdown led to significant changes in ongoing thought patterns in daily life and that these changes were associated with changes to our daily routine that occurred during lockdown.",The impact of social isolation and changes in work patterns on ongoing thought during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom
"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Karnataka state jointly and to assess variation across geographical regions and risk groups. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering three risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka's infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and were sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULTS: Overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1 to 29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5 to 18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5 to 13.8). Case-to-infection ratio 1:40, and infection fatality rate 0.05%. Influenza-like-symptoms or contact with COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatics compared to 47% asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our sentinel-based population survey is the first comprehensive survey to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden. Our findings provide a reasonable approximation of the population immunity threshold levels. Leveraging existing surveillance platforms, coupled with syndromic approach and sampling framework, renders our model replicable.","The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population: Results from a statewide sentinel-based population survey in Karnataka, India"
"BACKGROUND: Family medicine physicians may encounter a wide variety of conditions, including acute and urgent cases. Considering the limited access to diagnostic investigations in primary care practice, chest X-ray remains the imaging modality of choice. The current study assessed the competency of family medicine residents in the interpretation of chest X-rays for emergency conditions and to compare it with that of diagnostic radiology residents, general practitioners, and medical interns. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to 600 physicians, including family medicine residents, medical interns, general practitioners, and diagnostic radiology residents. The study included some background information such as gender, years in practice, training type, interest in pulmonary medicine and diagnostic radiology, and having adequate training on the interpretation of chest X-rays. The survey had 10 chest X-ray cases with brief clinical information. Participants were asked to choose the most likely diagnosis and to rate their degree of confidence in the interpretation of the chest X-ray for each case. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 205 physicians (response rate = 34.2%). The overall diagnostic accuracy was 63.1% with a significant difference between family medicine and radiology residents (58.0% vs. 90.5%; P < 0.001). The COVID-19 pneumonia (85.4%) and pneumoperitoneum (80.5%) cases had the highest diagnostic accuracy scores. There was a significant correlation between the diagnostic confidence and accuracy (r(s) = 0.39; P < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that being diagnostic radiology residents (odds ratio [OR]: 13.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5–67.7) and having higher diagnostic confidence (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3–3.8) were the only independent predictors of achieving high diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The competency of family medicine residents in the interpretation of chest X-ray for emergency conditions was far from optimal. The introduction of radiology training courses on emergency conditions seems imperative. Alternatively, the use of tele-radiology in primary healthcare centers should be considered.

"The coronavirus (COVID-19) has appeared as the greatest challenge due to its continuous structural evolution as well as the absence of proper antidotes for this particular virus. The virus mainly spreads and replicates itself among mass people through close contact which unfortunately can happen in many unpredictable ways. Therefore, to slow down the spread of this novel virus, the only relevant initiatives are to maintain social distance, perform contact tracing, use proper safety gears, and impose quarantine measures. But despite being theoretically possible, these approaches are very difficult to uphold in densely populated countries and areas. Therefore, to control the virus spread, researchers and authorities are considering the use of smartphone based mobile applications (apps) to identify the likely infected persons as well as the highly risky zones to maintain isolation and lockdown measures. However, these methods heavily depend on advanced technological features and expose significant privacy loopholes. In this paper, we propose a new method for COVID-19 contact tracing based on mobile phone users' geolocation data. The proposed method will help the authorities to identify the number of probable infected persons without using smartphone based mobile applications. In addition, the proposed method can help people take the vital decision of when to seek medical assistance by letting them know whether they are already in the list of exposed persons. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform the smartphone app-based solutions.",An Automated Contact Tracing Approach for Controlling Covid-19 Spread Based on Geolocation Data from Mobile Cellular Networks

"OBJECTIVES: Measures to control the on-going Covid-19 pandemic such as quarantine and social distancing, together with information overload about the sporadic spread of the disease have negatively impacted many individuals’ mental and psychosocial health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of self-reported mental health parameters and the coping mechanisms of employees and students in a Saudi State University. METHODS: An online survey in both Arabic and English was launched targeting students, staff and faculty of King Saud University from May 11 to June 6, 2020, the peak of Saudi Arabia’s nationwide lockdown. A total of 1542 respondents (726 males and 816 females) aged 20-65 years old participated. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents claimed to have suffered from anxiety (58.1%), depression (50.2%) and insomnia (32.2%) during the lockdown. On average, 65.3% respondents agreed that family bond strengthened during lockdown. Those in the highest quartile of family bonding score (Q4) were 41% [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.59 (0.39-0.87), p<0.001] and 59% [OR 0.41 (CI 0.27-0.64), p<0.001] were less likely to be anxious and depressed, respectively, even after adjusting for covariates.

"The conventional medical curriculum in India needed more focus on explicit teaching and assessment of interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, team-work and reflection for prevention and better management of increasing incidences of violence against doctors by building good doctor-patient relationships. Increasing number of seats in Indian medical colleges, decreasing hospital stay of patients, and decrease in faculty requirements will hamper adequate supervised authentic clinical experiences of undergraduates for developing clinical skills. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant decrease in student-patient encounters. Simulated patients are being used in many countries to address many of these issues. To make the Indian medical graduates competent to function as primary physician of first contact, competency-based medical education along with guidelines for use of skill-lab and simulation has been introduced from 2019.

"INTRODUCTION Food hypersensitivity (FHS), including food allergy, coeliac disease and food intolerance, is a major public health issue. The Food Standards Agency (FSA), an independent Government department working to protect public health and consumers' wider interests in food, sought to identify research priorities in the area of FHS. METHODS A Priority Setting Exercise was undertaken, using a methodology adapted from the James Lind Alliance - the first such exercise with respect to food hypersensitivity. A UK-wide public consultation was held to identify unanswered research questions. After excluding diagnostics, desensitisation treatment and other questions which were out of scope for FSA or where FSA was already commissioning research, 15 indicative questions were identified and prioritised by a range of stakeholders, representing food businesses, patient groups, healthcare and academia, local authorities and the FSA. RESULTS 295 responses were received during the public consultation, which were categorised into 70 sub-questions and used to define 15 key evidence uncertainties (""indicative questions"") for prioritisation. Using the JLA prioritisation framework, this resulted in 10 priority uncertainties in evidence, from which 16 research questions were developed. These could be summarised under the following 5 themes: communication of allergens both within the food supply chain and then to the end-consumer (ensuring trust in allergen communication); the impact of socioeconomic factors on consumers with FHS; drivers of severe reactions; mechanism(s) underlying loss of tolerance in FHS; and the risks posed by novel allergens/processing. DISCUSSION In this first research prioritisation exercise for food allergy and FHS, key priorities identified to protect the food-allergic public were strategies to help allergic consumers to make confident food choices, prevention of FHS and increasing understanding of socioeconomic impacts. Diagnosis and treatment of FHS was not considered in this prioritisation.",Identifying key priorities for research to protect the consumer with food hypersensitivity: a UK Food Standards Agency Priority Setting Exercise.
"The BIS and Entropy systems are used as indicators of anaesthetic drug effect, and can also record EEGs in digital form. A number of studies have used such recordings for analysis, even though information about bandwidth and fidelity has not been provided by the manufacturers. In this study we consider these systems purely as EEG recording devices, and evaluate their suitability for quantitative analysis. Using a calibrated electronic testing system, we played an artificial test signal of known amplitude with frequency varying from 0.01 to 400 Hz into the BIS and Entropy EEG systems, and saved the recording in each of their supported recording modes. The amplitude of the recording at each frequency was then used to derive the frequency response curves, as well as the 3 dB and 0.5 dB points for each mode. There are important differences between the various BIS and Entropy recordings. The BIS 256 Hz and the Entropy 400 Hz recordings are broadly comparable, although Entropy has a slightly reduced response above 50 Hz and below 1 Hz. The BIS 128 Hz recording has a somewhat reduced bandwidth, due to its relatively low sampling rate. The Entropy 100 Hz recording in the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 monitor has a flawed implementation, leading to aliasing of signals over 50 Hz and potential distortion of the recording, while in the GE Carescape it has an uneven response and a narrowed bandwidth. Consequently, it is important to know which specific host monitor was used when an Entropy 100 Hz recording was made. In summary, the choice of recording device and host monitor may affect the results of some quantitative EEG analysis, and some previously published studies may need to be re-evaluated.",Frequency response of EEG recordings from BIS and Entropy devices.
"Importance During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several cases of chilblains have been reported. Objective To determine if chilblains are associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This monocentric case series was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, a tertiary care hospital in Brussels, Belgium, between April 10 and April 17, 2020. We evaluated a total of 31 referred patients who had recently developed chilblains. Main Outcomes and Measures Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients and in skin biopsy specimens for 22 patients. Blood samples from all patients were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies. All patients had extended blood analyses. Histologic (22 patients) and immunofluorescence examinations (15 patients) were performed on the skin biopsy specimens. Results The 31 patients were generally in good health; most were teenagers or young adults, and 19 were women. Histopathologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens (22 patients) confirmed the diagnosis of chilblains and showed occasional lymphocytic or microthrombotic phenomena. Immunofluorescence analyses showed vasculitis of small-diameter vessels in 7 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and in biopsy samples of the skin lesions. The IgM and IgG antibody titers were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients (<1.0 arbitrary unit/mL). No significant abnormalities in blood test results were suggestive of systemic disease. Antinuclear antibody titers were low in 7 patients and higher in 1 patient. Conclusions and Relevance Chilblains appeared not to be directly associated with COVID-19 in this case series. Lifestyle changes associated with community containment and lockdown measures are a possible explanation for these lesions.",Evaluation of Chilblains as a Manifestation of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
"During rollout of coronavirus disease vaccination, policymakers have faced critical trade-offs. Using a mathematical model of transmission, we found that timing of vaccination rollout would be expected to have a substantially greater effect on mortality rate than risk-based prioritization and uptake and that prioritizing first doses over second doses may be lifesaving.","Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination Timing and Risk Prioritization on Mortality Rates, United States"
"To control the spread of COVID-19, China has imposed national lockdown policies to restrict the movement of its population since the Chinese New Year of January 2020. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the changes of pollution sources in Shanghai during the COVID-19 lockdown; a high-resolution emission inventory of typical pollution sources including stationary source, mobile source, and oil and gas storage and transportation source was established based on pollution source data from January to February 2020. The results show that the total emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were 9520.2, 37,978.6, 2796.7, and 7236.9 tons, respectively, during the study period. Affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, the mobile source experienced the largest decline. The car mileage and oil sales decreased by about 80% during the COVID-19 lockdown (P3) when compared with those during the pre-Spring Festival (P1). The number of aircraft activity decreased by approximately 50%. The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on industries such as iron and steel and petrochemicals was less significant, while the greater impact was on coatings, chemicals, rubber, and plastic. The emissions of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and VOCs decreased by 11%, 39%, 37%, and 47%, respectively, during P3 when compared with those during P1. The results show that the measures to control the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic made a significant contribution to emission reductions. This study may provide a reference for other countries to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on emissions and help establish regulatory actions to improve air quality.","A high-resolution typical pollution source emission inventory and pollution source changes during the COVID-19 lockdown in a megacity, China"
"Aiming to automatically detect COVID-19 from cough sounds, we propose a deep attentive multi-model fusion system evaluated on the Track-1 dataset of the DiCOVA 2021 challenge. Three kinds of representations are extracted, including hand-crafted features, image-from-audio-based deep representations, and audio-based deep representations. Afterwards, the best models on the three types of features are fused at both the feature level and the decision level. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attention-based fusion at the feature level achieves the best performance (AUC: 77.96%) on the test set, resulting in an 8.05% improvement over the official baseline.",The EIHW-GLAM Deep Attentive Multi-model Fusion System for Cough-based COVID-19 Recognition in the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Knowledge of ventilator waveforms is important for clinicians working with children requiring mechanical ventilation. This review covers the basics of how to interpret and use data from ventilator waveforms in the pediatric intensive care unit. RECENT FINDINGS: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common finding in pediatric patients and observed in approximately one-third of ventilator breaths. PVA is associated with worse outcomes including increased length of mechanical ventilation, increased length of stay, and increased mortality. Identification of PVA is possible with a thorough knowledge of ventilator waveforms. SUMMARY: Ventilator waveforms are graphical descriptions of how a breath is delivered to a patient. These include three scalars (flow versus time, volume versus time, and pressure versus time) and two loops (pressure-volume and flow-volume). Thorough understanding of both scalars and loops, and their characteristic appearances, is essential to being able to evaluate a patient’s respiratory mechanics and interaction with the ventilator.",The Basics of Ventilator Waveforms
"Purpose: Dementia is the major cause for disability and dependence in older people and associated with considerable psychological burden. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of Dignity Therapy, a brief psychotherapeutic intervention to enhance dignity and reduce psychological burden, in patients with early stage dementia and in their families or close friends. Materials and methods: In this randomized, waitinglist-controlled clinical trial a total of 54 patients with new diagnosis of early stage dementia and 54 study partners (spouses: n = 37; relatives: n = 14; close friends: n = 3) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment (n = 28) or delayed treatment (n = 26) after 3 months waiting. The main outcomes were feasibility: proportion of screened and invited patients who consented participation; Acceptability: number of drop-outs, and satisfaction with treatment; Efficacy: psychological burden (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-HADS), quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), and sense of dignity (Patient Dignity Inventory-PDI). Results: In total 38.6% of all eligible patients (n = 140) consented and were enrolled. Along the study six participants (11.1%) dropped out. Patients' satisfaction with the treatment was high and with no significant difference between the groups. HADS scores were significantly lower in both groups at the 3-months follow-up (immediate group: mean difference = -2.69, SE = 0.85, P = 0.003; delayed group: mean difference = -1.97, SE = 0.89, P = 0.031). There was no significant group by time interaction effect (F = 0.71; df = 2, 70.3; P = 0.50). PDI scores only decreased significantly (i.e., improvement of dignity) in the immediate group (mean difference = -6.56, SE = 1.63, P < 0.001; delayed group: mean difference = -3.01, SE = 1.69, P = 0.081), but the group by time interaction effect was not statistically significant (F = 2.29; df = 1, 46.8; P = 0.14). Quality of life improved in some respects by the treatment, but the immediate and the delayed group did not differ significantly over time. After pooling patients' data of both groups, Dignity Therapy resulted in significant improvements in almost all outcome measures. Patients' family members/close friends reported high satisfaction with the intervention. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Dignity Therapy is feasible and highly accepted in patients with early stage dementia. Patients reported significant improvements, however, there was no significant effect of the intervention in the immediate treatment group compared to the delayed group.","Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Efficacy of Dignity Therapy in Patients With Early Stage Dementia and Their Family.

"Background: Patients (pts) with cancer are purported to be more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, cancer encompasses a spectrum of heterogenous tumor subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection risk and COVID-19 prevalence according to tumor subtype in the resident cancer population of the Province of Parma (Emilia Romagna Region, Nothern Italy) during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Methods: We analyzed data from the Parma Province Cancer Registry, COVID-19 hospital medical records, and local surveillance system of all laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning of the outbreak (February, 20) to July 19, 2020. All the Parma resident cancer population was classified as either “active” or “inactive” according to the evidence of any referral to health services, for any reason, during the observation period. Study analyses were adjusted for patient demographics, tumor subtype and period of cancer diagnosis. Results: 40,148 cancer pts (mean age 68;57.8% females;45.1% active) were analyzed. The cumulative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.2% for cancer pts vs. 7% for non-cancer subjects (P < 0.0001). The overall COVID-19 attack rate was 2.2% (95% CI, 2.0-2.4) and 2.6% (95% CI, 2.4-2.9) for inactive and active cancer pts, respectively. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in active vs. inactive cancer subjects (HR 1.18, P = 0.01). In the active cancer group, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in lung cancer pts vs. other tumors (HR 4.3). In the same group, HR for breast cancer pts was 0.86. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis of COVID-19 cumulative incidence showed a significant interaction between active patient status and hematological malignancies. Conclusions: In our study, cancer pts were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in active vs. inactive cancer subjects. However, cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases and pts with different tumor types had differing susceptibility to COVID-19 phenotypes. COVID-19 fatality rates for subgroups will be reported at the meeting. Legal entity responsible for the study: University Hospital of Parma. Funding: Has not received any funding. Disclosure: A.

"BACKGROUND The popularity of videoconferencing platforms has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there have been concerns regarding the potential for video calls to promote appearance dissatisfaction, as individuals are exposed to their reflection on camera for extended periods. OBJECTIVES The current study characterized current video usage behaviors and their relationship with appearance dissatisfaction and interest in aesthetic procedures in the general population. METHODS An online survey was completed by 335 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in 'video manipulation' techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention while on video calls (ie, on self or others). The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video use behaviors were associated with greater body image disturbance. RESULTS Over 1/3 of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, greater engagement in video manipulation behaviors, and increasing appearance concerns due to their time on video calls. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty treatments (eg, waxing) and aesthetic procedures (eg, non-surgical procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections). CONCLUSIONS This is one of first empirical studies to report the potential consequences of video call usage for increasing appearance dissatisfaction and dysmorphic concern, and to demonstrate a link between the use of video calls and interest in cosmetic procedures.",The Zoom Effect: Exploring the Impact of Video Calling on Appearance Dissatisfaction and Interest in Aesthetic Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
"BACKGROUND: In recent decades, earthquakes, as natural hazards that caused direct effects both on communities and the chemical industry, produced many Natech events. Natech term is utilizing to describe the technological disasters caused by natural hazards. This study was conducted on the emergency evacuation challenges of residential areas adjacent to a refinery near Tehran based on H(2)S toxic gas release following a possible earthquake scenario. METHODS: This Research was an applied study at two phases in 2020. In the first phase, a review study was conducted to identify the community's previous experiences on emergency evacuation following Natech events. In the second phase, the challenges of emergency evacuation were analyzed based on the scenario of a possible earthquake and gas release from the refinery. RESULTS: Due to the high seismic vulnerability of structures in the area affected Natech risk, the total Resident population in this area would be affected simultaneously by an earthquake and H(2)S gas release in concentration 30 ppm as the result of the earthquake impact on chemical facilities. Emergency evacuation would be inevitable. The existing evacuation places are very unsafe and dangerous due to having open spaces. The nearest suitable evacuation places were found in the north direction for more than 38 % of the exposed population and in the east, west, and south direction for more than 61% of them. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency evacuation challenges were discussed in 4 viewpoints, disrupted or interrupted rescue and firefighting operation, unnecessary evacuation, frequent evacuation, and evacuation behavior. The measures such as revising and updating emergency evacuation maps; public informing, training, preparedness; providing protocols and training for operational and therapeutic response teams; and coordination improvement can help resilience increasing to such disasters.",Challenges of emergency evacuation of residential areas caused by chemical release due to the earthquake: a Natech event scenario
"This paper deals with mathematical modelling and analysis of a SEIQR model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 considering delay in conversion of exposed population to the infected population. The model is analysed for local and global stability using Lyapunov method of stability followed by Hopf bifurcation analysis. Basic reproduction number is determined, and it is observed that local and global stability conditions are dependent on the number of secondary infections due to exposed as well as infected population. Our study reveals that asymptomatic cases due to exposed population play a vital role in increasing the COVID-19 infection among the population.",Modelling and analysis of a SEIQR model on COVID-19 pandemic with delay
"As we pass the nearly 9 month mark of the coronavirus virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, we sought to compile a brief multi-disciplinary compendium of COVID-19 information learned to date. COVID-19 is an active viral pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that confers high morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 has been associated with: pulmonary compromise and acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombotic events, inflammation and cytokine, and post-infectious syndromes. Mitigation of these complications and expeditious therapy are a global urgency; this is brief summary of current data and management approaches synthesized from publications, experience, cross-disciplinary expertise (Figure 1).",COVID-19 Cliff Notes: A COVID-19 Multidisciplinary Care Compendium
"RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient, natural process conserved among species from different kingdoms. RNAi is a transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in which, double-stranded RNA or hairpin RNA is cleaved by an RNase III-type enzyme called Dicer into small interfering RNA duplex. This subsequently directs sequence-specific, homology dependent, Watson-Crick base-pairing post-transcriptional gene silencing by binding to its complementary RNA and initiating its elimination through degradation or by persuading translational inhibition. In plants, worms, and insects, RNAi is the main and strong antiviral defense mechanism. It is clear that RNAi silencing, contributes in restriction of viral infection in vertebrates. In a short period, RNAi has progressed to become a significant experimental tool for the analysis of gene function and target validation in mammalian systems. In addition, RNA silencing has then been found to be involved in translational repression, transcriptional inhibition, and DNA degradation. RNAi machinery required for robust RNAi-mediated antiviral response are conserved throughout evolution in mammals and plays a crucial role in antiviral defense of invertebrates, but despite these important functions RNAi contribution to mammalian antiviral innate immune defense has been underestimated and disputed. In this article, we review the literature concerning the roles of RNAi as components of innate immune system in mammals and how, the RNAi is currently one of the most hopeful new advances toward disease therapy. This review highlights the potential of RNAi as a therapeutic strategy for viral infection and gene regulation to modulate host immune response to viral infection.",Antiviral innate immune response of RNA interference.
"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of adding trimetazidine to other anti-anginal drugs on the functional capacity of ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients not suitable for revascularization when compared to first-line antianginal drugs alone. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for English-language peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing trimetazidine with first-line antianginal drugs alone or with placebo in IHD patients not suitable for revascularization and were included in this review. Quality of studies were assessed using the Cochrane collaboration ""risk of bias"" tool. RESULTS: Six RCTs, three were crossover studies. A total of 312 participants were included in this review. Overall quality of studies was moderate. Two studies found improvement in the 6-minute walking test (6-MWT) [standardized mean differences (SMD) 1.75; 95% CI 1.35 to 2.14; p <0.001], and two trials found improvement in the Canadian cardiovascular society (CCS) grading of angina class (SMD -1.37; 95% CI -1.89 to -0.84) in the trimetazidine group. Three of the better-quality trials found no increase in total exercise duration (TED) (SMD 0.34; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.78; p < 0.13). Significant heterogeneity was identified among trials describing outcomes for the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF %). CONCLUSION: Trimetazidine improve walking time and angina severity in IHD patients not suitable for revascularization. Due to the inconsistency of available evidence, RCTs targeting IHD patients with ""no option"" to undergo coronary revascularization is required to clarify this review question.",Effect of trimetazidine on the functional capacity of ischemic heart disease patients not suitable for revascularization: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
"Multifocal pneumonia amidst this global pandemic is often attributed to COVID-19, resulting in missed diagnosis of other potentially fatal illnesses such as eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophilic pneumonia is often associated with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A 65-year-old male presented to the emergency department for a four-day history of fatigue, cough, and worsening dyspnea; CT thorax showed extensive multifocal pneumonia, and COVID-19 was suspected. COVID-19 testing using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was negative, and complete blood count revealed peripheral eosinophilia, which is not expected in COVID-19. The patient was being treated concomitantly with daptomycin and ceftaroline for septic arthritis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We reconsidered our initial diagnosis and held daptomycin, after which the patient started to improve. Due to hypoxia, steroids were added, which resulted in a dramatic improvement of the patient's symptoms. Daptomycin can have toxic effects, resulting in the accumulation of eosinophils in the lung parenchyma. Symptoms usually arise by the third week and include dyspnea, peripheral eosinophilia, and infiltrates involving the outer one-third of the lung fields. FDA drug safety guidance helped to establish this diagnosis. The treatment options include the removal of offending agents and steroids in severe cases.",Multifocal Pneumonia Amidst the Global COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case of Daptomycin-Induced Eosinophilic Pneumonia
"The manner in which scientific information related to the COVID-19 pandemic has been shared and discussed in similar venues has, to date, been largely neglected. Considering the role that such discourse plays in knowledge sharing and knowledge production, it is essential to understand such communication processes as they relate to global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examines communication expressed by participants in the r/COVID19 subreddit, a community that facilitates scientific discussion of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. A computational content analysis was performed to identify the primary themes of users' communication on r/COVID19, while stepwise segmented regression was used to assess identify longitudinal changes in the volume of user contributions. Findings showed that while conversations were centered on scientific conversations, they were catalyzed by sociological and political developments rather than scientific breakthroughs. Future studies should examine the effects of pandemic-related communities on lurkers, the effects of visibility on scientific and medical contributions, and the implications of pseudonymity and ambiguous credentials in a community addressing a volatile health and scientific topic.",Communication Expressed on the COVID-19 Subreddit in the Midst of a Global Pandemic
"BACKGROUND: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on healthcare has led to rapid changes in otolaryngology service provisions. As such, new standard operating procedures for the management of suspected tonsillitis or quinsy were implemented in our centre. METHODS: A retrospective audit was performed of acute referrals to ENT of patients with suspected tonsillitis, peritonsillar cellulitis or quinsy, during the 10 weeks before (group 1) and 10 weeks after (group 2) implementation of the new standard operating procedures. RESULTS: Group 2 received fewer referrals. Fewer nasendoscopies were performed and corticosteroid use was reduced. The frequency of quinsy drainage performed under local anaesthetic increased, although the difference was not statistically significant. Hospital admission rates decreased from 56.1 to 20.4 per cent, and mean length of stay increased from 1.13 to 1.5 days. Face-to-face follow up decreased from 15.0 to 8.2 per cent, whilst virtual follow up increased from 4.7 to 16.3 per cent. There were no significant differences in re-presentation or re-admission rates. CONCLUSION: Management of suspected tonsillitis or quinsy using the new standard operating procedures appears to be safe and effective. This management should now be applied to an out-patient setting in otherwise systemically well patients.",Improving the management of suspected tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess referred to ENT - a coronavirus disease 2019 service improvement
"Chronic diseases represent one of the main causes of death worldwide. The integration of digital solutions in clinical interventions is broadly diffused today; however, evidence on their efficacy in addressing psychological comorbidities of chronic diseases is sparse. This systematic review analyzes and synthesizes the evidence about the efficacy of digital interventions on psychological comorbidities outcomes of specific chronic diseases. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted. Only Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were considered and either depression or anxiety had to be assessed to match the selection criteria. Of the 7636 identified records, 17 matched the inclusion criteria: 9 digital interventions on diabetes, 4 on cardiovascular diseases, 3 on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and one on stroke. Of the 17 studies reviewed, 14 found digital interventions to be effective. Quantitative synthesis highlighted a moderate and significant overall effect of interventions on depression, while the effect on anxiety was small and non-significant. Design elements making digital interventions effective for psychological comorbidities of chronic diseases were singled out: (a) implementing a communication loop with patients and (b) providing disease-specific digital contents. This focus on “how” to design technologies can facilitate the translation of evidence into practice.",Digital Interventions for Psychological Comorbidities in Chronic Diseases—A Systematic Review
"A sensitive and convenient immunoassay that can directly differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) virus from seasonal influenza virus can play an important role in the clinic. In the presented study, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA), based on two monoclonal antibodies against haemagglutinin (HA) of the pH1N1 virus, was developed. After laboratory determination of the sensitivity and specificity characteristics, the performance of this assay was evaluated in a cohort of 904 patients with influenza-like illness. All seven strains of pH1N1 virus tested were positive by pH1N1 ELISA, with an average lower detection limit of 10(3.0 ± 0.4) tissue culture infective dose (TCID)(50)/mL (or 0.009 ± 0.005 HA titre). Cross-reaction of the assay with seasonal influenza virus and other common respiratory pathogens was rare. In pH1N1-infected patients, the sensitivity of the pH1N1 ELISA was 92.3% (84/91, 95% CI 84.8–96.9%), which is significantly higher than that of the BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B test (70.3%, p <0.01). The specificity of pH1N1 ELISA in seasonal influenza A patients was 100.0% (171/171, 95% CI 97.9–100.0%), similar to that in non-influenza A patients (640/642, 99.7%, 95% CI 98.9–100.0%). The positive predictive value for pH1N1 ELISA was 97.7% and the negative predictive value was 99.1% in this study population with a pH1N1 prevalence of 10.1%. In conclusion, detection of HA of pH1N1 virus by immunoassay appears to be a convenient and reliable method for the differential diagnosis of pH1N1 from other respiratory pathogens, including seasonal influenza virus.",Differential diagnosis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection by detection of haemagglutinin with an enzyme-linked immunoassay
"Background Longevity is of considerable interest. Collation of recent data after World War II by the Human Mortality Database allowed analyses, previously unattainable, of modal death-ages for sufficient numbers of large European pooled cohorts. Objective To track modes, means and medians (≥60 years old (y)) of all-cause mortality for both sexes. Methods The only highest-quality, large-number Lexis data available were pooled from nine European countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland; raw-data modes (and means/medians ≥60y, plus thin-plate-splines), were analyzed, plus loess-smoothed equivalents for individual countries. Results Here we show that for ∼25-30 years (cohorts 1880-∼1909) dramatic overall sex differences existed between pooled raw-death-age changes: male modal ages being near-constant (77.2y ±; standard deviation 1.58y); females’ increased. Overall, for available cohorts (1880-1904) male raw medians were exactly constant (76y); male means showed slight increase (0.0193y/year; compare female: 0.146y/year). Male deaths ≥60≤76y compared with >76y, as percentages of total, were near-equal, whereas in females the former decreased. Only after ∼1910 did male modal ages rapidly increase (other averages not calculable). Individual country results showed that males in Finland, France, Switzerland were affected less than other countries. Conclusions Results clarify previously knowledge concerning sex differences during this period. Despite improved environment during late adulthood, this did not translate into increased male longevity and earlier events might have sealed their fate, especially in Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. One hypothesis concerns long-term effects of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, perhaps directly relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic at present.",Median/modal death ages of pooled European male cohorts were near-constant for ~25/30 years

The results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the number of model iterations and improve the model convergence speed and prediction accuracy by introducing migration learning in the deep learning DenseNet model, with an accuracy of more than 85%, sensitivity of more than 94%, specificity of about 80%, and good prediction performance on the training and test sets. It can also detect hepatic steatosis grade 1 more accurately and reliably, and achieve automated and more accurate grading, which has some practical application value.",Study on the Grading Model of Hepatic Steatosis Based on Improved DenseNet
"OBJECTIVES: Elastomeric half-mask respirator (EHMR) use in healthcare increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concern for potential release of infectious aerosols from EHMR exhalation valves prompted recommendations to cover them with surgical masks (SMs), thereby improving source control. The physiological and subjective effects of wearing a SM over the exhalation valve of an EHMR, however, are unknown. METHODS: Twelve healthy healthcare worker volunteers completed a 30-min series of simulated healthcare-related tasks, including resting, talking, walking, and bending, proning and supinating a weighted manikin, and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This series recurred three times with different mask configurations—SM only, EHMR only, or EHMR with SM covering the exhalation valve. A transcutaneous sensor continuously measured carbon dioxide (tcPCO(2)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and heart rate (HR) from each subject. Subjects scored their rates of perceived exertion (RPE) and levels of discomfort after each round. Physiological parameters and subjective scores were analyzed using mixed linear models with a fixed effect for mask type, activity, age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. Analysis also tested for interaction between mask type and activity. RESULTS: Physiological parameters remained within normal ranges for all mask configurations but varied by task. Statistically significant but small decreases in mean tcPCO(2) (37.17 versus 37.88 mmHg, P < 0.001) and SpO(2) (97.74 versus 97.94%, P < 0.001) were associated with wearing EHMR with SM over the exhalation valve compared with EHMR alone. Mean HR did not differ between these mask configurations. Wearing SM only was associated with lower RPE and level of discomfort compared with EHMR, but these subjective scores did not differ when comparing EHMR with SM to EHMR only. Age, BMI, and gender had no significant effect on any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing a SM over an EHMR did not produce clinically significant changes in tcPCO(2), SpO(2), or HR compared with uncovered EHMR during healthcare-related tasks. Covered EHMR use also did not affect perceived exertion or discomfort compared with uncovered EHMR use. Covering the exhalation valve of an EHMR with a SM for source control purposes can be done safely.",Physiological Impacts of Surgical Mask Coverage of Elastomeric Half-mask Respirator Exhalation Valves in Healthcare Workers
"ORF3a has been identified as a viroporin of SARS-CoV-2 and is known to be involved in various pathophysiological activities including disturbance of cellular calcium homeostasis, inflammasome activation, apoptosis induction and disruption of autophagy. ORF3a-targeting antibodies may specifically and favorably modulate these viroporin-dependent pathological activities. However, suitable viroporin-targeting antibodies are difficult to generate because of the well-recognized technical challenge associated with isolating antibodies to complex transmembrane proteins. Here we exploited a naïve human single chain antibody phage display library, to isolate binders against carefully chosen ORF3a recombinant epitopes located towards the extracellular N terminal and cytosolic C terminal domains of the protein using peptide antigens. These binders were subjected to further characterization using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis to assess their binding affinities to the target epitopes. Binding to full-length ORF3a protein was evaluated by western blot and fluorescent microscopy using ORF3a transfected cells and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Co-localization analysis was also performed to evaluate the “pairing potential” of the selected binders as possible alternative diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 infections. Both ORF3a N and C termini, epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies were identified in our study. Whilst the linear nature of peptides might not always represent their native conformations in the context of full protein, with carefully designed selection protocols, we have been successful in isolating anti-ORF3a binders capable of recognising regions of the transmembrane protein that are exposed either on the “inside” or “outside” of the infected cell. Their therapeutic potential will be discussed.",Monoclonal Human Antibodies That Recognise the Exposed N and C Terminal Regions of the Often-Overlooked SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a Transmembrane Protein
"Earlier definitions of status epilepticus (SE) were based on the duration of seizures, but newer definitions rely more on a pragmatic staging based on treatment failures (Table 23.1). Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is defined as SE that continues despite administration of both benzodiazepines and an appropriately dosed second-line antiseizure drug. Depending on the semiology of the seizures and comorbidities of the patient, this stage may be treated with further antiseizure drugs or anesthesia. When seizures recur upon weaning the anesthetic agent, typically after 24 h of seizure suppression, or in the rare cases where seizure control cannot be achieved with anesthesia, status epilepticus is considered to be super refractory (SRSE). The incidence of status epilepticus has been increasing, from 3.5 to 12.5/100,000 population between 1979 and 2010. During this time hospital mortality has not changed [1].",Super Refractory Status Epilepticus

"Background: A key to an effective Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Community Intervention is to understand populations who are most vulnerable to it. We aimed at evaluating characteristics of New York City communities where rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases were particularly high. Methods: The study outcomes - neighborhood-specific confirmed COVID-19 cases, positive tests, and COVID-19 attributable deaths were calculated using data extracted from the New York City government health website, which were linked to results from Community Health Survey. Distributions of study outcomes across New York City community districts and their associations with neighborhood characteristics were examined using Jonckheere-Terpstra tests. Results: As of May 21, 2010, rates of confirmed cases ranged from 0.8% (Greenwich Village and Soho) to 3.9% (Jackson Heights), and the rates of attributable death from to 0.6‰ (Greenwich Village and Soho) to 4.2‰ (Coney Island). Higher percentages of black, Hispanic and foreign-born populations, lower educational attainment, poverty, lack of health insurance, and suboptimal quality of health care were all factors found to be correlated with increased rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The epidemiology of COVID-19 exhibited great variations among neighborhoods in New York City. Community interventions aimed at COVID-19 prevention and mitigation should place high priorities in areas with large populations of blacks and Hispanics and economically disadvantages areas.","Factors Associated with COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization and Death in New York City Neighborhoods"
"BACKGROUND: Already at hospital admission, clinicians require simple tools to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality. Such tools can significantly improve resource allocation and patient management within hospitals. From the statistical point of view, extended time-to-event models are required to account for competing risks (discharge from hospital) and censoring so that active cases can also contribute to the analysis. METHODS: We used the hospital-based open Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study with 630 COVID-19 patients from Isfahan, Iran. Competing risk methods are used to develop a death risk chart based on the following variables, which can simply be measured at hospital admission: sex, age, hypertension, oxygen saturation, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. The area under the receiver operator curve was used to assess accuracy concerning discrimination between patients discharged alive and dead. RESULTS: Cause-specific hazard regression models show that these baseline variables are associated with both death, and discharge hazards. The risk chart reflects the combined results of the two cause-specific hazard regression models. The proposed risk assessment method had a very good accuracy (AUC = 0.872 [CI 95%: 0.835–0.910]). CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to improve and validate a personalized mortality risk calculator based on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The risk assessment of patient mortality provides physicians with additional guidance for making tough decisions.",Absolute mortality risk assessment of COVID-19 patients: the Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study
"Eye diseases are remarkably common and encompass a large and diverse range of morbidities that affect different components of the visual system and visual function. With advances in omics technology of eye disorders, genome-scale datasets have been rapidly accumulated in genetics and epigenetics field. However, the efficient collection and comprehensive analysis of different kinds of omics data are lacking. Herein, we developed EyeDiseases (https://eyediseases.bio-data.cn/), the first database for multi-omics data integration and interpretation of human eyes diseases. It contains 1344 disease-associated genes with genetic variation, 1774 transcription files of bulk cell expression and single-cell RNA-seq, 105 epigenomics data across 185 kinds of human eye diseases. Using EyeDiseases, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism in eye infection and found that the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly correlated with cornea and keratoconus, suggest that ocular surface cells are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, integrating analysis of Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) GWAS loci and co-expression data revealed 9 associated genes involved in HIF-1 signaling pathway and voltage-gate potassium channel complex. The EyeDiseases provides a valuable resource for accelerating the discovery and validation of candidate loci and genes contributed to the molecular diagnosis and therapeutic vulnerabilities with various eyes diseases.","EyeDiseases: an integrated resource for dedicating to genetic variants, gene expression and epigenetic factors of human eye diseases"
"BACKGROUND: The response in the United States to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for the infection. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing. A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Antibodies in Diverse Samples: Protocol to Validate the Sufficiency of Provider-Observed, Home-Collected Blood, Saliva, and Oropharyngeal Samples"
"Objective Despite widespread use of flow diverters (FDs) to treat aneurysms, the exact healing mechanism associated with FDs remains poorly understood. We aim to describe the healing process of aneurysms treated using FDs by demonstrating the histopathologic progression in a canine aneurysm model. Methods Twenty-one side wall aneurysms were created in common carotid artery of eight dogs and treated with two different FDs. Angiographic follow-ups were done immediately after placement of the device, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At last follow-up, the aneurysm and the device-implanted parent artery were harvested. Results Histopathologic findings of aneurysms at 4 weeks follow-up showed intra-aneurysm thrombus formation in laminating fashion, and neointimal thickening at the mid-segment of aneurysm. However, there are inhomogenous findings in aneurysms treated with the same type of FD showing same angiographic outcomes. At 12 weeks, aneurysms of complete and near-complete occlusion revealed markedly shrunken aneurysm filled with organized connective tissues with thin neointima. Aneurysms of incomplete occlusion at 12 weeks showed small amount of organized thrombus around fringe neck and large empty space with thick neointmal formation. Neointimal thickness and diameter stenosis was not significantly different between the groups of FD specification and follow-up period. Conclusion Intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation and organization seem to be an important factor for the complete occlusion of aneurysms treated using the FD. Neointimal formation could occur along the struts of the FD independently of intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation. However, neointimal formation could not solely lead to complete aneurysm healing.",Healing of Aneurysm after Treatment Using Flow Diverter Stent : Histopathological Study in Experimental Canine Carotid Side Wall Aneurysm.
"A measurement is presented of differential cross sections for t-channel single top quark and antiquark production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 Te by the CMS experiment at the LHC. From a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb - 1 , events containing one muon or electron and two or three jets are analysed. The cross section is measured as a function of the top quark transverse momentum ( p T ), rapidity, and polarisation angle, the charged lepton p T and rapidity, and the p T of the W boson from the top quark decay. In addition, the charge ratio is measured differentially as a function of the top quark, charged lepton, and W boson kinematic observables. The results are found to be in agreement with standard model predictions using various next-to-leading-order event generators and sets of parton distribution functions. Additionally, the spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top quark polarisation, is determined from the differential distribution of the polarisation angle at parton level to be 0.440 ± 0.070 , in agreement with the standard model prediction.",Measurement of differential cross sections and charge ratios for t-channel single top quark production in proton-proton collisions at s = 13 Te .
"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the most common diarrhea-causing pathogen in newborn piglets The clarifications of the overall antibody repertoire and antigen-specific antibody repertoire are essential to provide important insights into the B-cell response and reshape new vaccines Here, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to investigate immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) gene segment usage of swine B-cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells following PEDV vaccination We identified the transcripts of all functional Ig V-genes in antibody repertoire IgHV1S2, IgKV1-11, and IgLV3-4 were the most prevalent gene segments for heavy, kappa, and lambda chains, respectively, in PBL and MLN Unlike previous studies, IgKV1, instead of IgKV2, and IgLV3, instead of IgLV8, were the prevalent Ig V-gene families for kappa and lambda light chains, respectively We further examined the antibody repertoire of PEDV spike-specific B cells by single-cell RT-PCR In contrast to the overall antibody repertoire, Ig V-gene segments of PEDV spike-specific B cells preferentially adopted IgHV1-4 and IgHV1-14 for heavy chain, IgKV1-11 for kappa chain, and IgLV3-3 for lambda chain These results represent a comprehensive analysis to characterize the Ig V-gene segment usage in the overall and PEDV spike-specific antibody repertoire in PBL and MLN",Next-generation sequencing and single-cell RT-PCR reveal a distinct variable gene usage of porcine antibody repertoire following PEDV vaccination
"Vitamin D(3) is an essential micronutrient mediating pleiotropic effects in multiple tissues and cell types via its metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), which activates the transcription factor vitamin D receptor. In this study, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from five healthy adults and investigated transcriptome-wide, whether the precursor of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)), has gene regulatory potential on its own. Applying thresholds of >2 in fold change of gene expression and <0.05 as a false discovery rate, in this ex vivo approach the maximal physiological concentration of 25(OH)D(3) (250 nM (nmol/L)) none of the study participants had a significant effect on their PBMC transcriptome. In contrast, 1000 and 10,000 nM 25(OH)D(3) regulated 398 and 477 genes, respectively, which is comparable to the 625 genes responding to 10 nM 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). The majority of these genes displayed specificity to the tested individuals, but not to the vitamin D metabolite. Interestingly, the genes MYLIP (myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein) and ABCG1 (ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1) showed to be specific targets of 10,000 nM 25(OH)D(3). In conclusion, 100- and 1000-fold higher 25(OH)D(3) concentrations than the reference 10 nM 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) are able to affect the transcriptome of PBMCs with a profile comparable to that of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3).",Transcriptome-Wide Profile of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D(3) in Primary Immune Cells from Human Peripheral Blood
"Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a novel circovirus first discovered in the United States in piglets and sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, cardiac and multisystemic inflammation. Here, seven PCV3 strains were identified for the first time from neonatal pigs with clinical signs of congenital tremors (CT) in South China. The tissue tropism of PCV3 in CT-affected piglets was analysed by the real-time quantitative PCR, and the result showed that high loads of viral genomes were detected in the brains and hearts. The complete genomes of seven new PCV3 revealed 96.8%-99.6% nucleotide identities with eleven other PCV3 strains previously reported from the United States and China. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequences showed that all PCV3 strains clustered together and were clearly separated from other circovirus species. This study reports on the first identification of PCV3 in CT-affected newborn piglets and provides the epidemiological information of neonatal piglets with CT in Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces of China.",Detection and genome sequencing of porcine circovirus 3 in neonatal pigs with congenital tremors in South China.
"Mangrove land use changes of varied intensities have long been a problem in tropical mangrove forests. This has resulted in various degrees of mangrove land use modification, which catch many interests in the region for research. The research provided here is a bibliometric analysis of scholarly articles published around the world in various publication document types on changes in land use of tropical mangrove forests based on remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Scientific data analysis was undertaken by using bibliometric approaches on 6,574 papers extracted from the Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020. The findings revealed that the number of publications continuously climbed from under 400 to an average of 50–60 per year till 2019. The data showed that the mangrove forest modifications study gained traction when the highest number of citations, 9,236 in 2015, were observed. We can also notice that the overall number of citations fluctuated a lot during the first five years (2010–2015) but increased from 2013 to 2015. The findings demonstrate how remote sensing satellites have aided vegetation and land study in recent years. The findings also revealed that the analysis tools of Land Use Change, Vegetation Index, Mangrove, Tropical Country, Remote Sensing, and Tropical contributed to scientific knowledge of current issues of mangrove land use change in the tropical region. The authors' keywords, Remote Sensing in particular, supplied roughly 43%, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (13%), Vegetation Index (9%), and other keywords contributed less than 7%. The growth pattern of the keywords ""MODIS"" and ""Landsat"" implies that both will stay important over the next five years, according to an analysis of the type of satellite used in land use assessment. Meanwhile, papers pertaining to policy on land use change, food security, and forest resources were evaluated in order to highlight policy and academic research findings on the topics. The application of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which is a very relevant tool that can be used in monitoring land use changes and assessing vegetation status because it is a desirable technique in measuring plant health and vigour, can help fill the research gaps presented in this study. This review can help with the development of better mangrove land use change approaches in tropical mangroves and around the world using satellite remote sensing and GIS.",A bibliometric analysis of tropical mangrove forest land use change from 2010 to 2020
"OBJECTIVES: With the emergence of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Canada and the curtailment of clinical and face‐to‐face university instruction in British Columbia on March 16, 2020, the opportunity arose to explore how third‐ and fourth‐year undergraduate dental students critically considered the impact of the pandemic on education and the practice of dental geriatrics. METHODS: All third‐ and fourth‐year undergraduate dental students within a dental geriatric module were asked to provide a written guided reflection on the question: “In your opinion, what factors make outbreaks (or pandemics) like COVID‐19 relevant to the practice of dental geriatrics?” Reflections were gathered from March 12 to May 8, 2020. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify and interpret patterns of meaning within the reflections by means of an interactive coding process. RESULTS: A total of 115 reflections, between 291 and 710 words each, were received from 56 third‐year (62.5% male) and 59 fourth‐year (42.6% male) students. Five main themes emerged: experiencing uncertainties, frailty as a moderator, constraints in accessing care, preparedness protocol, and redefining care. The frequency in which the same codes, categories, and themes were assigned varied from 16 to 140 times. CONCLUSIONS: Students’ reflections highlighted the effects of the pandemic, not only on their education but also on frail older adults themselves and the profession of dentistry in general. Further studies are warranted to explore how this curtailment might impact educators’ approaches to geriatric education, as well as the way graduating students will set up their practices and approach geriatric care in the future.",COVID‐19 pandemic: Students’ perspectives on dental geriatric care and education

"BACKGROUND Success in conducting clinical trials during the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic requires the ability to innovate and adapt. There are well-established procedures for the blinding of investigational agents, especially medications, in placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials within the Veterans Health Administration. However, these procedures, managed by research pharmacists, may not apply to investigational agents that are not exclusively managed by pharmacy, such as blood products, including coronavirus disease of 2019 convalescent plasma (plasma). In the absence of established blinding procedures, such studies require special design considerations to minimize uncertainty or bias. METHODS We describe the processes and procedures developed for blinding of plasma in ""Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1"" as a prototypical study using this class of investigational therapeutic agents. Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1 is an ongoing multicenter randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of plasma added to conventional therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. RESULTS We report the design of procedures to supply investigational blood products or 0.9% normal saline (saline) control while ensuring the integrity of the blind. Key aspects include workflow considerations, physical blinding strategies, and methods for engaging stakeholders. These procedures leverage the well-established Veterans Affairs research pharmacist's research infrastructure, and Blood Bank Services, which is responsible for blood-based investigational products. CONCLUSION By describing the methods used to deliver blood products in a blinded manner in Veterans Affairs CoronavirUs Research and Efficacy Studies-1, we strive both to educate and to increase awareness to improve the implementation of these biological therapeutics for future, high-quality research studies.","Designing and implementing methodology for double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials using blood products within the Department of Veterans Affairs."
"While social distancing measures are essential in limiting the impact of a pandemic, such measures are often less feasible for low-income groups such as precarious workers who continue to travel on public transit and are less able to practice social distancing measures. In this paper, based on in-depth remote interviews conducted from April 2020 through June 2020, with more than 130 gig and precarious workers in New York City, we find that precarious workers experience three main hurdles in regard to accessing unemployment assistance that can be broadly categorized as knowledge, sociological, and temporal/financial barriers. Drawing on worker interview responses, we have named these responses: (1) Didn’t Know, (2) Didn’t Want, and (3) Can’t Wait. These challenges have led workers to turn to gig and precarious work, further highlighting the inequities of the pandemic. As a result, for some workers, so-called “side hustles” have become their primary social safety net.

"BACKGROUND Many patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are physically frail or have substantial functional impairments. There is growing evidence that such patients are at higher risk for medication-induced adverse events. Furthermore, frailty seems to be more predictive of poor clinical outcomes than chronological age alone. To our knowledge, no systematic review of clinical trials examining drug therapy of AD or behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) has specifically focused on the topic of physical frailty. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in AD patients with frailty or significant functional impairments. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug therapy of AD and BPSD in patients with significant functional impairments according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Cochrane research criteria. Significant functionally impaired patient populations were identified using the recommendations of the Medication and Quality of Life in frail older persons (MedQoL) Research Group. Screening, selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Outcomes including functional status, cognitive function, changes in BPSD symptoms, clinical global impression and quality of life were analysed. For assessing harm, we assessed adverse events, drop-outs as a proxy for treatment tolerability and death. Results were analysed according to Cochrane standards and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS Of 45,045 search results, 38,447 abstracts and 187 full texts were screened, and finally, 10 RCTs were included in the systematic review. Selected articles evaluated pharmacotherapy with acetylcholinesterase-inhibitors (AChEI), anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Studies of AChEIs suggested that patients with significant functional impairments had slight but significant improvements in cognition and that AChEIs were generally well tolerated. Studies of antidepressants did not show significant improvements in depressive symptoms. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants showed small effects on some BPSD items but also higher rates of adverse events. However, due to the very small number of identified trials, the quality of evidence for all outcomes was low to very low. Overall, the small number of eligible studies demonstrates that significantly functional impaired older patients have not been adequately taken into consideration in most clinical trials investigating drug therapy of AD and BPSD. CONCLUSION Due to lack of evidence, it is not possible to give specific recommendations for drug therapy of AD and BSPD in frail older patients or older patients with significant functional impairments. Therefore, clinical trials focussing on frail older adults are urgently required. A standardized approach to physical frailty in future clinical studies is highly desirable.",Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease and for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in older patients with moderate and severe functional impairments: a systematic review of controlled trials.
"Chest-X ray (CXR) radiography can be used as a first-line triage process for non-COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. However, the similarity between features of CXR images of COVID-19 and pneumonia caused by other infections make the differential diagnosis by radiologists challenging. We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier with Nvidia Jetson Nano that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images we were able to successfully implement our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images. We propose that our COVID-19-Classifier can be used in conjunction with other tests for optimal allocation of hospital resources by rapid triage of non-COVID-19 cases.",Sistem deteksi otomatis Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) menggunakan gambar chest X-ray dengan Jetson nano
"The development of minimally invasive procedures has rekindled interest in endoluminal techniques for the management of Zenker's diverticulum. Tissue sealers as employed in laparoscopic surgery have not been previously used for Zenker's diverticulum septotomy.Supported by the established safety of linear cutters, bipolar forceps, and ultrasonic scalpels, we have started a procedure using the Ligasure 5™ tissue sealer. Safety and efficacy results in our early clinical experience are shown for a prospective series of 5 consecutive Zenker's diverticulum cases that were perorally managed with tissue sealing.The procedure was quickly and safely performed in the endoscopy room under sedation. Mean number of seals per patient was 2, and mean procedure duration was 33 minutes. No complications developed during or after the procedure, and patients were discharged with immediate dysphagia relief and adequate oral tolerance. No diverticular relapses occurred after a mean follow-up of 21 months (range 18-30). This procedure may be repeated as often as desired with no need for hospital admission. Safety should be prospectively assessed by further studies using a higher number of procedures.",Transoral endoluminal approach to Zenker's diverticulum using Ligasure™. Early clinical experience.
"β-Sitosterol (24-ethyl-5-cholestene-3-ol) is a common phytosterol Chinese medical plants that has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In this study we investigated the effects of β-sitosterol on influenza virus-induced inflammation and acute lung injury and the molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that β-sitosterol (150–450 μg/mL) dose-dependently suppresses inflammatory response through NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells, which was accompanied by decreased induction of interferons (IFNs) (including Type I and III IFN). Furthermore, we revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of β-sitosterol resulted from its inhibitory effect on retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling, led to decreased STAT1 signaling, thus affecting the transcriptional activity of ISGF3 (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3) complexes and resulting in abrogation of the IAV-induced proinflammatory amplification effect in IFN-sensitized cells. Moreover, β-sitosterol treatment attenuated RIG-I-mediated apoptotic injury of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) via downregulation of pro-apoptotic factors. In a mouse model of influenza, pre-administration of β-sitosterol (50, 200 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1), i.g., for 2 days) dose-dependently ameliorated IAV-mediated recruitment of pathogenic cytotoxic T cells and immune dysregulation. In addition, pre-administration of β-sitosterol protected mice from lethal IAV infection. Our data suggest that β-sitosterol blocks the immune response mediated by RIG-I signaling and deleterious IFN production, providing a potential benefit for the treatment of influenza.",β-sitosterol ameliorates influenza A virus-induced proinflammatory response and acute lung injury in mice by disrupting the cross-talk between RIG-I and IFN/STAT signaling
"COVID-19 has led to the most widespread public health crisis in recent history. The first case of the disease was detected in India on 31 January 2019, and confirmed cases stand at 74,281 as of 13 May 2020. Mathematical modeling can be utilized to forecast the final numbers as well as the endpoint of the disease in India and its states, as well as assess the impact of social distancing measures. In the present work, the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model have been implemented to predict the endpoint of COVID-19 in India as well as three states accounting for over 55% of the total cases - Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi. The results using the SIR model indicate that the disease will reach an endpoint in India on 12 September, while Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi will reach endpoints on 20 August, 30 July and 9 September respectively. Using the Logistic Regression model, the endpoint for India is predicted on 23 July, while that for Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi is 5 July, 23 June and 10 August respectively. It is also observed that the case numbers predicted by the SIR model are greater than those for the Logistic Growth model in each case. The results suggest that the lockdown enacted by the Government of India has had only a moderate impact on the spread of COVID-19, and emphasize the need for firm implementation of social distancing guidelines.",Progression of COVID-19 in Indian States - Forecasting Endpoints Using SIR and Logistic Growth Models
"BACKGROUND: Triglycerides with varying chain length and unsaturation degree are now in high demand in the food and pharmaceutical industries Enzymatic catalyzed synthesis methods are favored over chemical-based processes in the commercial production of triglycerides This study found that the application of vacuum can improve the efficiency and productivity of enzymatic synthesis of various triglycerides using Novozym 435 (EC 3 1 1 3), an immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica The system was used for esterification of fatty acids varying in chain length, unsaturation degree, and oxidation degree RESULTS: The vacuum condition was not applicable to short chain fatty acids (C4–C6) due to loss of fatty acids in the reaction The conversions of C4–C6 saturated fatty acids were low (15–35%) under atmospheric pressure Under vacuum, high conversions (&gt;95%) and triglyceride yields (approximately 90%) were achieved in the esterification of glycerol with several medium-chain and long-chain (C8–C18) saturated fatty acids Moreover, unsaturation degree of fatty acids also affected the triglyceride yield The triglyceride contents synthesized from C18:2n-6 (76 17 ± 0 45%) was significantly lower (P &lt; 0 05) than those from C18:0 (91 59 ± 1 58%) and C18:1n-9 (90 77 ± 0 85%) Furthermore, fatty acids with a high oxidation degree had negative effect on triglyceride synthesis This vacuum solvent free system allowed the synthesis enzyme to be reused 11 times without significant decrease in the lipase activity for esterification of fatty acids CONCLUSION: The studied vacuum facilitated triglyceride synthesis process provides an economically attractive yet sustainable solution for the production of a wide range of triglyceride products © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",High efficiency enzymatic synthesis of triglycerides with varying chain length and degree of unsaturation in a solvent-free system under vacuum
"The reported COVID‐19 cases in the United States of America have crossed over 10 million and a large number of infected cases are undetected whose estimation can be done if country‐wide antibody testing is performed. In this study, we estimate this undetected fraction of the population by a modeling and simulation approach. We employ an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers, symptomatic, purely asymptomatic, and exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the social distancing conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of the total number of confirmed, active and dead, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study predicts the possible outcomes of the infection if social distancing conditions are relaxed or kept stringent. We estimate that around 30.1 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 66.2 million (range: 64.3–68.0) people, or 20% (range: 19.4–20.5) of the population will be infected by mid‐February 21 if social distancing conditions are not made stringent. We find the infection‐to‐fatality ratio to be 0.65% (range: 0.63–0.67).",Estimation of undetected symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of COVID‐19 infection and prediction of its spread in the USA
"Many microorganisms have mechanisms that protect cells against attack from viruses. The fermentation components of Streptomyces sp. 1647 exhibit potent anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity. This strain was isolated from soil in southern China in the 1970s, but the chemical nature of its antiviral substance(s) has remained unknown until now. We used an integrated multi-omics strategy to identify the antiviral agents from this streptomycete. The antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis of its genome sequence revealed 38 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, and the target BGCs possibly responsible for the production of antiviral components were narrowed down to three BGCs by bioactivity-guided comparative transcriptomics analysis. Through bioinformatics analysis and genetic manipulation of the regulators and a biosynthetic gene, cluster 36 was identified as the BGC responsible for the biosynthesis of the antiviral compounds. Bioactivity-based molecular networking analysis of mass spectrometric data from different recombinant strains illustrated that the antiviral compounds were a class of structural analogues. Finally, 18 pseudo-tetrapeptides with an internal ureido linkage, omicsynins A1–A6, B1–B6, and C1–C6, were identified and/or isolated from fermentation broth. Among them, 11 compounds (omicsynins A1, A2, A6, B1–B3, B5, B6, C1, C2, and C6) are new compounds. Omicsynins B1–B4 exhibited potent antiviral activity against IAV with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of approximately 1 µmol∙L(–1) and a selectivity index (SI) ranging from 100 to 300. Omicsynins B1–B4 also showed significant antiviral activity against human coronavirus HCoV-229E.

People utilize aloneness with different motivations (self-determined versus not self-determined motivations for solitude) and this can determine one’s unique way to deal with life events. This study was designed to assess these motivations for solitude among medical students of a tertiary care centre and to find their relationship with Covid-19 related anxiety and resilience among these students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an analytical cross-sectional study where more than 300 medical students (age above 17, of either gender, from 1(st) year to final year of MBBS) of a tertiary care institute of Eastern India were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. The study was passed by the Institute’s Ethical Committee. Motivation for Solitude Scale – Short Form, COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-Abbreviated (CD-RISC2) were the principal tools to be applied. RESULTS: The collected data is under being entered and will be analysed using the appropriate statistical tests. The obtained results and their discussion will be shared during the presentation. CONCLUSION: The outcome of the study, in terms of different motivations for solitude, is expected to influence the policymaking in assessments as well as psychosocial interventions for vulnerable students during a loneliness crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.","Assessment of motivation for solitude, covid-19 related anxiety and resilience among medical students"
"The fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) plays an important role in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Activating mutations in the FLT3 receptor can be detected in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and are associated with a distinctly poor clinical outcome for patients. There are now several classes of FLT3 inhibitors in development with varying degrees of potency and selectivity for the target, including several in late-phase clinical trials in combination with chemotherapy. Major clinical responses in AML patients receiving single-agent FLT3 inhibitors have been rare, although transient peripheral blood blast reduction is common. Given such biological suggestion and preclinical activity, FLT3 inhibitors hold promise in improving the outcome of patients with mutant FLT3 AML. This review summarizes the current attempts to target this molecule, with emphasis on the validity of the target, the results of the clinical trials evaluating the FLT3 inhibitors in AML, the optimal use of these compounds and the mechanisms of resistance.",FLT3 inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia.
"Expectations weigh heavily on the shoulders of Canadian library associations Association members and library workers increasingly demand that library associations assume the role of professional development provider, policy developer, advocate, and lobbyist As a result, associations must evaluate the landscape in which they are operating, and be prepared to align their mission, vision, and values to ensure they are meeting the expectations of their respective library sectors and communities This paper introduces five articles written by leaders in Canadian library associations that recently undertook a significant shift in their structure, focus, and direction following a period of evaluation and reflection Three guiding principles emerge from these articles: listen to your community, do not go it alone, and any shift, big or small, takes time",Shift Happens: The Recent Evolution of Canadian Library Associations

"The objectives of this study were to examine the evolution of fathers' long-term dyadic adjustment after the birth of a child and to analyze their evolution considering related factors. A total of 113 Spanish fathers with a mean age of 35.72 years (SD = 3.84 years) participated. In general, there was a decline in the dyadic adjustment of the fathers until 6-12 months after childbirth, after which their level of adjustment remained stable until 13-24 months. We observed different patterns when analyzing the evolution by subgroups formed based on these different variables, previous experience of paternity, and anxiety. The intrinsic differences between fathers should also be considered because these differences can influence the way in which men face the parental process as well as the evolution of the quality of their relationship with their partner.",Longitudinal Study of Dyadic Adjustment in a Sample of Spanish Fathers.
"BACKGROUND: To avoid misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE), ensure health care workers’ safety, and avoid shortages, effective communication of up-to-date infection control guidelines is essential. As prehospital teams are particularly at risk of contamination given their challenging work environment, a specific gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module targeting this audience might provide significant advantages as it requires neither the presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a gamified e-learning module could improve the rate of adequate PPE choice by prehospital personnel in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This was an individual-level randomized, controlled, quadruple-blind (investigators, participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts) closed web-based trial. All emergency prehospital personnel working in Geneva, Switzerland, were eligible for inclusion, and were invited to participate by email in April 2020. Participants were informed that the study aim was to assess their knowledge regarding PPE, and that they would be presented with both the guidelines and the e-learning module, though they were unaware that there were two different study paths. All participants first answered a preintervention quiz designed to establish their profile and baseline knowledge. The control group then accessed the guidelines before answering a second set of questions, and were then granted access to the e-learning module. The e-learning group was shown the e-learning module right after the guidelines and before answering the second set of questions. RESULTS: Of the 291 randomized participants, 176 (60.5%) completed the trial. There was no significant difference in baseline knowledge between groups. Though the baseline proportion of adequate PPE choice was high (75%, IQR 50%-75%), participants’ description of the donning sequence was in most cases incorrect. After either intervention, adequate choice of PPE increased significantly in both groups (P<.001). Though the median of the difference in the proportion of correct answers was slightly higher in the e-learning group (17%, IQR 8%-33% versus 8%, IQR 8%-33%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=.27). Confidence in the ability to use PPE was maintained in the e-learning group (P=.27) but significantly decreased in the control group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Among prehospital personnel with an already relatively high knowledge of and experience with PPE use, both web-based study paths increased the rate of adequate choice of PPE. There was no major added value of the gamified e-learning module apart from preserving participants' confidence in their ability to correctly use PPE.",Effect of an E-Learning Module on Personal Protective Equipment Proficiency Among Prehospital Personnel: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial

"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demonstrated a negative influence on many underlying diseases, their course, and prognosis. A combined course of active tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and COVID-19 is a rare case in the routine clinical practice;therefore, it is of scientific and practical interest. In a 41-year-old patient with severe chronic disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV infection, presence of tuberculosis mycobacteria, resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid, chronic respiratory failure, cachexia, and immunodeficiency, COVID-19 was manifested only by the detection of SARS-Cov-2 virus from the nasopharynx and did not influence the treatment and prognosis of tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: The described case of a combination of active tuberculosis with HIV infection and COVID-19 demonstrated that effective treatment of specific tuberculosis process is quite possible. © 2021, Eco-Vector LLC.

"Background: Human Fascioliasis is a zoonotic infection caused by the adult stage of Fasciola species. Fasciola hepatica is a parasite that, following living in its vertebrate host, reduces the host's inflammatory immune responses to infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Therefore, because of the completely unproven and limited data on this issue, we decided to evaluate the prevalence of antibodies against this parasite in patients admitted to the hospital due to relatively severe symptoms of COVID-19. Methods: : This cross-sectional study was conducted on the serum samples of 182 patients with COVID-19 disease who were diagnosed by PCR test and 210 healthy subjects in Alborz Province, Iran between March and June 2020. Anti- Fasciola antibodies status was determined in all serum samples, using ELISA technique. A self-developed questionnaire was used to measure demographic information. Results: : The frequency of Fasciola infection was found to be significantly higher in COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy control (n = 4, 2.2%, n = 9, 4.3%;respectively) ( P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients and control group in age, education, and gender ( P > 0.05). Conclusions: : This study indicates that a significant association between Fasciola hepatica seropositivity and COVID-19 disease. Our finding suggests that Fasciola infection may be able to lead to decreased immune responses, thereby reducing the severity and symptoms of COVID-19 disease.",Fascioliasis and COVID-19: A Case-Control Study in Iran
"INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional education (IPE) about patient safety positively impacts safety and reduces errors but is challenging to deliver. We aimed to determine if a synchronous virtual IPE program using storytelling and interactive learning impacted student perceptions about patient safety. METHODS: An IPE patient safety program involving medical and pharmacy students was synchronously delivered virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was framed using storytelling about a medication error told by a family member. Post-program survey data, exploring participants' perspectives on the program, collected between July 2020 and November 2020 was retrospectively reviewed. Quantitative results were grouped by the five components of the program. Responses within each category were averaged to generate a summary measure of each student's experience. Qualitative feedback from two survey questions was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 236 (96.7% of participants) completed surveys included in the analysis. High proportions of participants responded favorably across all five components of the survey. Qualitative responses were largely positive, with themes of increased empathy, behavior, and attitude change, and meaning making. CONCLUSION: An interactive IPE patient safety program using storytelling about a real-life medication error to frame activities and utilizing a virtual platform was a favorable and impactful method to educate students.","Delivering interprofessional patient safety education using storytelling, a real-life medication error, and synchronous online platform"
"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is a threat to the health and well-being of millions of lifes across the globe. A significant proportion of adult patients require hospitalisation and may develop severe life-threatening complications. Children, on the other hand, can carry and transmit the virus, but usually do not develop severe disease. Mortality in the paediatric age-group is relatively low. Differences in virus containment and clearance, as well as reduced inflammation-related tissue and organ damage may be caused by age-specific environmental and host factors. Since severe complications in adults are frequently caused by uncontrolled immune responses and a resulting ""cytokine storm"" that may be controlled by targeted blockade of cytokines, previously established treatment with immunosuppressive treatments may indeed protect children from complications.",COVID-19 - Considerations for the paediatric rheumatologist

"H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts, and it carried out the risk of human-to-human transmission after outbreak in 2013. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","Clinical study of mesenchymal stem cell treating acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) infection, a hint for COVID-19 treatment"
"Background: D-dimer is a small protein fragment and high levels of D-dimer have been associated with increased mortality in patients presenting to emergency departments with infection Previous studies have reported increased levels of D-dimer in COVID-19;however, it is unclear whether an increased D-dimer level provides early warning of poor prognosis Therefore, this study aimed to assess the usefulness of D-dimer as an early indicator of prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, from February 15 to March 30, 2020 The final date of follow-up was April 11, 2020 Results: Of the 1,643 patients with COVID-19, 691 had elevated D-dimer levels Their median age was 65 years Of the patients with elevated D-dimer levels, 45% had comorbidities, with cardiovascular disease (205 [29 7%]) being the most common Patients with elevated D-dimer were more likely to require treatment with high-flow oxygen, anticoagulation, antibiotics, and admission to the intensive care unit They were also more likely to have increased interleukin-6, monocytes, and lymphocytes Patients with elevated D-dimer levels had significantly higher mortality than those with normal or low D-dimer levels Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, elevated D-dimer was associated with abnormal immunity, underlying disease, increased disease severity, and increased mortality Taken together, D-dimer may be a marker for the early warning of disease severity and increased risk of death These findings provide insights into the potential risk of elevated D-dimer in patients with COVID-19","D-Dimer as a Prognostic Indicator in Critically Ill Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China"

"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected communities worldwide. This study examines the impact that public health measures to control viral spread have had on orthopaedic trauma presenting to an Australian level 1 trauma centre. We hypothesized that the volume of orthopaedic trauma in the period of social distancing would decrease, and the mechanisms of injury differ, compared to pre-pandemic times. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients requiring emergency orthopaedic surgery between 16 March and 21 April 2020 (the period after social distancing and lockdown commenced), and compared it to the group of patients from the same period in 2019. We collected demographic data, as well as injury type, anatomical location, mechanism of injury and surgical logistics. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, total emergency operations performed decreased by 15.6% compared to the same period in 2019. Orthopaedic admissions decreased by 30.8%. Demographics of the groups were unchanged. Anaesthetic time decreased, but total time spent in the operating theatre was unchanged. Road trauma comprised a similar proportion of cases overall; however, cycling-related accidents increased significantly, making up 11% of presentations during COVID-19. Sporting injuries, work-related injuries and multi-traumas reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19-related lockdown measures and social distancing on orthopaedic trauma in Australia has been an overall decrease in volume of cases, combined with significant changes in the mechanisms of injury necessitating surgery.",Impact of COVID-19-related social restrictions on orthopaedic trauma in a level 1 trauma centre in Sydney: the first wave
"CONTEXT Older adults are less likely than younger adults to receive naloxone therapy. Given high rates of prescription opioid use/misuse and increasing illicit opioid use among older adults, factors associated with naloxone administration for older opioid poisoning cases need examination. METHODS We analyzed the 83,135 opioid-involved cases aged 50+ from the 2015-2020 National Poison Data System. Single-variable logistic regression was used to examine associations of naloxone administration with demographic factors, exposure site/reason, medical outcomes, management site/level of care, clinical effects, and other interventions. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine associations of naloxone administration with different types of opioids. RESULTS Over the six years, the proportion of prescription opioid cases that received naloxone therapy increased steadily from 21.9% to 28.4%. The proportion of illicit opioid cases that received naloxone therapy was 51.9% in 2015 and 59.8% in 2020 with a high of 64.4% in 2019. In 2020, the death rate for illicit opioid cases without naloxone therapy was 31.4% compared to 2.3% for those with the therapy. Cases managed at healthcare facilities (HCF) had higher odds of receiving naloxone therapy. Among prescription opioid cases, naloxone therapy rates among older and female cases and those managed at non-HCF settings were especially low even for major medical outcomes. Cases involving oxycodone, morphine, methadone, prescription fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and other/unknown opioids had higher odds of naloxone administration. DISCUSSION Rates of naloxone therapy for older prescription opioid poisoning cases need improvement. While rates were higher among illicit opioid cases, the drop in 2020 and the sharp increase in deaths among illicit opioid cases without naloxone therapy confirm the importance of access to this life-saving intervention. CONCLUSIONS Increased naloxone co-prescribing and other means of facilitating access to naloxone are needed to prevent opioid poisoning deaths among older adults who use prescription opioids.","Naloxone therapy for prescription and illicit opioid poisoning cases aged 50 + in the national poison data system, 2015-2020."

After the worldwide spread of COVID-19, common symptoms are already well known as fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pneumonia, abdominal pain and diarrhea, either loss of olfaction or sense of taste. Neurological complications are perhaps less known as headache, dizziness, agitation, executive dysfunction or, in particular cases, viral encephalitis and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis may also occur. In COVID-19 patients, ischemic stroke or cerebral vein thrombosis are also more commonly related to the increased risk of thrombosis. In the long term, so called post-COVID syndrome can emerge in the form of fatigue, depression or many other mental disorders. The most common disease of the peripheral nervous system is Guillain-Barré syndrome.

"The outbreak of the new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has caused a huge impact on the world. In this case, only by adhering to the prevention and control methods of early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment, can the spread of the virus be prevented to the greatest extent. This article uses artificial intelligence–assisted medical imaging diagnosis as the research object, combines artificial intelligence and CT medical imaging diagnosis, introduces an intelligent COVID-19 detection system, and uses it to achieve COVID-19 disease screening and lesion evaluation. CT examination has the advantages of fast speed and high accuracy, which can provide a favorable basis for clinical diagnosis. This article collected 32 lung CT scan images of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Two professional radiologists analyzed the CT images using traditional imaging diagnostic methods and artificial intelligence–assisted imaging diagnostic methods, and the comparison showed the gap between the two methods. According to experiments, CT imaging diagnosis assisted by artificial intelligence only takes 0.744 min on average, which can save a lot of time and cost compared with the average time of 3.623 min for conventional diagnosis. In terms of comprehensive test accuracy, it can be concluded that the combination of artificial intelligence and imaging diagnosis has extremely high application value in COVID-19 diagnosis.",The value of artificial intelligence and imaging diagnosis in the fight against COVID-19
"Various techniques have been described for blind bedside placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube. However, there is no universal method and the technique depends on the local institutional resources and expertise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple new technique for the bedside placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube in an intensive care unit using palpation to confirm tube position. We studied 47 consecutive ventilated patients (mean body mass index 22.4 ± 4.2 kg/m(2)) requiring enteral tube feeding for nutritional support. We monitored the maximum intensity point of injected air 'bubbling' by palpation and estimated tube position. We monitored the movement of the maximum intensity point from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant. If the maximum intensity point on the right upper quadrant diminished or weakened, we considered the tube had proceeded beyond the pylorus. By palpation, we could feel the bubbling of the injected air in all patients, but four patients were excluded because of failure to complete the protocol. The overall success rate including the four excluded cases was 85.1% (40/47) on the first attempt and 91.5% (43/47) when we included the second attempt. The median time for 40 successful tube placements on the first attempt was 10 (7 to 23) minutes. Our new palpation technique can successfully detect the position of a feeding tube in the stomach and help guide the tube to the correct location in the post-pyloric portion of the stomach in lean critically ill patients.",A new technique for post-pyloric feeding tube placement by palpation in lean critically ill patients.
"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease known as Covid-19, has so far reported around 3,435,000 cases of human infections, including more than 239,000 deaths in 187 countries, with no effective treatment currently available. For this reason, it is necessary to explore new approaches for the development of a drug capable of inhibiting the entry of the virus into the host cell. Therefore, this work includes the exploration of potential inhibitory compounds for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VSB), which were obtained from The Patogen Box. Later, they were filtered through virtual screening and molecular docking techniques, thus obtaining a top of 1000 compounds, which were used against a binding site located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and a cryptic site located in the N-Terminal Domain (NTD), resulting in good pharmaceutical targets for the blocking the infection. From the top 1000, the best compound (TCMDC-124223) was selected for the binding site. It interacts with specific residues that intervene in the recognition and subsequent entry into the host cell, resulting in a more favorable binding free energy in comparison to the control compounds (Hesperidine and Emodine). In the same way, the compound TCMDC-133766 was selected for the cryptic site. These identified compounds are potential inhibitors that can be used for the development of new drugs that allow effective treatment for the disease.",Targeting Receptor Binding Domain and Cryptic Pocket of Spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 by biomolecular modeling
"Autophagy is a major self-degradative process through which cytoplasmic material, including damaged organelles and proteins, are delivered and degraded in the lysosome. Autophagy represents a dynamic recycling system that produces new building blocks and energy, essential for cellular renovation, physiology, and homeostasis. Principal autophagy triggers include starvation, pathogens, and stress. Autophagy plays also a pivotal role in immune response regulation, including immune cell differentiation, antigen presentation and the generation of T effector responses, the development of protective immunity against pathogens, and the coordination of immunometabolic signals. A plethora of studies propose that both impaired and overactive autophagic processes contribute to the pathogenesis of human disorders, including infections, cancer, atherosclerosis, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy has been also implicated in the development and progression of allergen-driven airway inflammation and remodeling. Here, we provide an overview of recent studies pertinent to the biology of autophagy and molecular pathways controlling its activation, we discuss autophagy-mediated beneficial and detrimental effects in animal models of allergic diseases and illuminate new advances on the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of human asthma. We conclude contemplating the potential of targeting autophagy as a novel therapeutic approach for the management of allergic responses and linked asthmatic disease.",Autophagy: A Friend or Foe in Allergic Asthma?
"This study aimed to explore metaphoric perceptions of patients with COVID-19 including treatment process, family relationships, and mental health via using metaphors. Purposive sampling was used to include participants. Totally 46 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The metaphor-based data collection process was carried out with three open-ended questions. The metaphors compiled according to questions and grouped by 13 themes according to analysis. Patients explained to COVID-19 process by using 91 different metaphors. Most frequently used metaphors by patients; black hole/dark for the treatment process of COVID-19, steel for family relationships, sea metaphor for mental health. This study, it was determined that individuals are afraid of death, have a serious perception of uncertainty, and their family relationships and this process negatively affected their family relationships and mental states.

"BACKGROUND: The Food, Environment, and Health (FEH) program of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) aims to improve the health of low- and middle-income country populations by generating evidence, innovations, and policies that reduce the health and economic burdens of preventable chronic and infectious diseases. A predominant focus of the FEH program is research related to consumer food environments that promote or enable healthy and sustainable shifts in consumption. An evaluation of the FEH program, led by the University of Toronto, provided an opportunity to analyse the approach and role of a development funder in building the field of food systems research. DISCUSSION: In this commentary, we provide an external evaluator’s perspective on the IDRC’s contributory role in building the field of food systems research, based on a secondary analysis of findings from a recent FEH program evaluation. We used the field-building framework outlined in Di Ruggiero et al. (Health Res Policy System, 2017) to highlight the strengths and challenges of the FEH’s approach to field-building and determined that the program aligns with six of the seven features of the framework. The FEH program has enhanced support and awareness for food systems research, provided organized funding and capacity-building opportunities, multilevel activity to support research and its use, and strong scientific leadership, and set significant standards and exemplars. However, we also found that not all sociopolitical environments have fully recognized or valued food systems research and its use for policy change. CONCLUSION: The FEH program’s field-building approach can be situated within the field-building framework, and it has been successful in laying the groundwork for building the field of food systems, particularly consumer food environments research. However, supportive external environments and further investments may be needed to achieve a critical mass of capacity, continue building communities of practice, and influence policy. The FEH program approach may serve as an exemplar and comparator for other research funding agencies looking to develop strategic research programming in the field of food systems research.",Building the field of food systems research: commentary on a research funder’s role
"The Sustainable Development goals for 2020 included reducing all causes associated with infant and perinatal mortality in their priorities. The use of compounds with bioactive properties has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy due to their stimulating effect on the host’s immune system. Additionally, biotherapeutic products such as postbiotics, tentatively defined as compounds produced during a fermentation process that support health and well-being, promote intestinal barrier integrity without posing considerable risks to children’s health. Although this is a concept in development, there are increasing studies in the field of nutrition, chemistry, and health that aim to understand how postbiotics can help prevent different types of infections in priority populations such as minors under the age of five. The present review aims to describe the main mechanisms of action of postbiotics. In addition, it presents the available current evidence regarding the effects of postbiotics against pathogens commonly involved in pediatric infections. Postbiotics may constitute a safe alternative capable of modulating the cellular response and stimulating the host’s humoral response.",Postbiotics against Pathogens Commonly Involved in Pediatric Infectious Diseases
"Recently resettled refugee populations may be at greater risk for exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus that causes coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and face unique challenges in following recommendations to protect their health. Several factors place resettled refugees at elevated risk for exposure to persons with COVID-19 or increased severity of COVID-19: being more likely to experience poverty and live in crowded housing, being employed in less protected, service-sector jobs, experiencing language and health care access barriers, and having higher rates of co-morbidities. In preparing for and managing COVID-19, resettled refugees encounter similar barriers to those of other racial or ethnic minority populations, which may then be exacerbated by unique barriers experienced from being a refugee. Key recommendations for resettlement and healthcare providers include analyzing sociodemographic data about refugee patients, documenting and resolving barriers faced by refugees, developing refugee-specific outreach plans, using culturally and linguistically appropriate resources, ensuring medical interpretation availability, and leveraging virtual platforms along with nontraditional community partners to disseminate COVID-19 messaging.",Potential Impact of COVID-19 on Recently Resettled Refugee Populations in the United States and Canada: Perspectives of Refugee Healthcare Providers
"Type I Interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of >500 genes, which are collectively called ISGs (IFN-stimulated genes). One of the earliest ISGs induced by IFNs is ISG15 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15). Free ISG15 protein synthesized from the ISG15 gene is post-translationally conjugated to cellular proteins and is also secreted by cells into the extracellular milieu. ISG15 comprises two ubiquitin-like domains (UBL1 and UBL2), each of which bears a striking similarity to ubiquitin, accounting for its earlier name ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP). Like ubiquitin, ISG15 harbors a characteristic β-grasp fold in both UBL domains. UBL2 domain has a conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly motif through which cellular proteins are appended via an enzymatic cascade similar to ubiquitylation called ISGylation. ISG15 protein is minimally expressed under physiological conditions. However, its IFN-dependent expression is aberrantly elevated or compromised in various human diseases, including multiple types of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), inflammatory diseases (Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD), bacteriopathy and viropathy), and in the lumbar spinal cords of veterans exposed to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). ISG15 and ISGylation have both inhibitory and/or stimulatory roles in the etiology and pathogenesis of human diseases. Thus, ISG15 is considered a “double-edged sword” for human diseases in which its expression is elevated. Because of the roles of ISG15 and ISGylation in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, conferring anti-cancer drug sensitivity to tumor cells, and its elevated expression in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and veterans exposed to TBI, both ISG15 and ISGylation are now considered diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these ailments. In the current review, we shall cover the exciting journey of ISG15, spanning three decades from the bench to the bedside.",ISG15 and ISGylation in Human Diseases
"The ongoing pandemic situation of COVID-19 has alarmed global public healthcare and epidemic response mechanisms to a significant extent. In this context, communication services can play an important role in hospitals to drive emergency response mechanisms accurately. Visible light communication (VLC) can become an excellent solution to provide communication services in hospitals as it uses low-cost LEDs to transmit information in the form of light signals which can not interfere with medical equipment and does not impact patient health. However, low bandwidth of LEDs is one of the major challenges, which limits the transmission capacity and distance in VLC system. In this work, we propose a post-amplification scheme based on low-pass filter and limiting amplifier to overcome the inherent bandwidth limitation of commercial LEDs. A 62.5Mbps non-return to zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation-based VLC link with error-free transmission can be achieved over a transmission distance of 6 ​m.",Experimental demonstration of 62.5 Mbps VLC link for healthcare infrastructures by incorporating limiting amplifier as an amplification scheme
"Background: The SARS-COV-2 virus has more than just an infectious role to play in the society. The rapid spread has also led to significant personal, professional, financial and economic recession globally. Health care professionals are getting seriously compromised due to these issues. No published data is available on the indirect effects of COVID-19 on high risk medical specialties. Otorhinolaryngology is considered as one such specialty. Hence we designed a national survey to address these issues. Materials and Methods: A google questionnaire was sent to all the otorhinolaryngologists in Czech Republic with the help of the Czech Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery to evaluate the problems they encountered during the first wave of COVID-19. Personal, professional and financial losses were also addressed. Online access to the survey was from 15 th April 2020 to 26 th April 2020. Results: The psychosomatic indirect impact of the disease affected female doctors than males. Burnout syndrome was the most commonly reported problem. Around 44.75% of all doctors had a combination of health, financial and economic as well as professional development and educational issues. Doctors from private practices faced higher financial losses. Conclusions: Our study showed that personal, professional and financial disturbances amongst doctors can lead to more serious consequences. With the lack of drastic measures in improving the support system for healthcare workers, the healthcare systems will fail quickly. Adequate support should be made mandatory by health authorities.","Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and undoubtedly COVID-19: the silent serial killer"
"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) are key components in highly active antiretroviral therapy for treating HIV-1. Herein we present the synthesis for a series of N1-alkylated uracil derivatives bearing ω-(2-benzyl- and 2-benzoylphenoxy)alkyl substituents as novel NNRTIs. These compounds displayed anti-HIV activity similar to that of nevirapine and several of them exhibited activity against the K103N/Y181C RT mutant HIV-1 strain. Further evaluation revealed that the inhibitors were active against most nevirapine-resistant mono- and di-substituted RTs with the exception of the V106A RT.

"By now, it is well established that the error rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that replicates RNA virus genomes is a primary driver of the mutation frequencies observed in RNA virus populations—the basis for the RNA quasispecies. Over the last 10 years, a considerable amount of work has uncovered the molecular determinants of replication fidelity in this enzyme. The isolation of high- and low-fidelity variants for several RNA viruses, in an expanding number of viral families, provides evidence that nature has optimized the fidelity to facilitate genetic diversity and adaptation, while maintaining genetic integrity and infectivity. This chapter will provide an overview of what fidelity variants tell us about RNA virus biology and how they may be used in antiviral approaches.",Fidelity Variants and RNA Quasispecies

"Several studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of infected people as in urban wastewater. The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater appears today as a powerful tool that can help in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The goal is to improve the prediction of new waves of COVID-19 outbreaks and provide an early warning of the evolution of the infection. In this research, we highlighted some practical and scientific aspects that emerged during an extensive ongoing monitoring campaign carried out on a large number of wastewater treatment plants located in the province of Trento (North Italy) and aimed at the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw municipal wastewater.

"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and characteristics of tramadol users in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. METHODS: Data from the national prescription databases comprising the entire population of Denmark, Norway and Sweden between 2007 and 2015 were used to assess prescription medicine use and sold amount (in defined daily doses (DDDs)) of tramadol, other opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2015 the prevalence of tramadol users increased in Denmark from 45 to 52 per 1,000 residents, and in Norway from 20 to 41 per 1,000 residents. In Sweden, the prevalence decreased from 36 to 17 per 1,000 residents. In comparison, the prevalence of other opioid users decreased in Denmark and Norway, but increased in Sweden. During the study period, there were more female than male tramadol users in all three countries, and the prevalence of tramadol users tended to increase with age. The average tramadol DDD per treated patient remained fairly constant in Norway, while it increased in Denmark and Sweden. In Denmark and Norway, women received a higher DDD than men. The amount of sold tramadol and other opioids combined per 1,000 residents was highest in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS: From 2007 to 2015, the prescription patterns of tramadol and other opioids differed between the three countries. Tramadol was generally used more frequently by women. Women received higher DDD then men in Norway and Denmark, but not in Sweden. The prevalence of tramadol users tended to increase with age in all countries. FUNDING: none.

"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping across the world. Previous studies have shown that gut microbiota is associated with COVID-19, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composed of Blautia genus, Lactobacillus genus, and Ruminococcus genus of Firmicutes is correlated with the severity of COVID-19. Gut microbiota imbalance in colorectal cancer patients may lead to the variation of OTU. RESULTS: Based on the GMrepo database, the gut microbiota of 1374 patients with colorectal neoplasms and 27,329 healthy people was analyzed to investigate the differences in the abundance of microbes between colorectal neoplasms patients and healthy people. Furthermore, We collected feces samples from 12 patients with colorectal cancer and 8 healthy people in Xiangya hospital for metabolomic analysis to investigate the potential mechanisms. Our study showed that the abundance of Blautia and Ruminococcus was significantly increased in colorectal neoplasms, which may increase the severity of COVID-19. The gender and age of patients may affect the severity of COVID-19 by shaping the gut microbiota, but the BMI of patients does not. CONCLUSIONS: Our work draws an initial point that gut microbiota imbalance is a risk factor of COVID-19 mortality and gut microbiota may provide a new therapeutic avenue for colorectal cancer patients.

"BACKGROUND: Limited therapeutic options exist for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is a potential therapeutic, but there is limited data for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are outcomes associated with administration of CCP in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were number of days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days; length of hospital stay; and change in WHO scores from CCP administration (or index date) to discharge. Of 151 patients who received CCP, 132 had complete follow-up data. Patients were transfused after a median of 6 hospital days; thus, we investigated the effect of convalescent plasma before and after this timepoint with 77 early (within 6 days) and 55 late (after 6 days) recipients. Among 3,217 inpatients who did not receive CCP, 2,551 were available for matching. RESULTS: Early CCP recipients, of whom 31 (40%) were on mechanical ventilation, had lower 14-day (15% vs 23%) and 30-day (38% vs 49%) mortality compared to a matched unexposed cohort, with nearly 50% lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality (HR 0.52, [95% CI 0.28–0.96]; P = 0.036). Early plasma recipients had more days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days (+3.3 days, [95% CI 0.2 to 6.3 days]; P = 0.04) and improved WHO scores at 7 days (-0.8, [95% CI: -1.2 to -0.4]; P = 0.0003) and hospital discharge (-0.9, [95% CI: -1.5 to -0.3]; P = 0.004) compared to the matched unexposed cohort. No clinical differences were observed in late plasma recipients. INTERPRETATION: Early administration of CCP improves outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, while improvement was not observed with late CCP administration. The importance of timing of administration should be addressed in specifically designed trials.",Early but not late convalescent plasma is associated with better survival in moderate-to-severe COVID-19

"N95 respirators comprise a critical part of the personal protective equipment used by frontline health-care workers and are typically meant for one-time usage. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g., use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post-decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration efficiency.",Recharging and rejuvenation of decontaminated N95 masks

"To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in pregnant patients and evaluate the association between disease severity and perinatal outcomes. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of all pregnant patients with a singleton gestation and a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered at 1 of 33 U.S. hospitals in 14 states from March 1 to July 31, 2020. Disease severity was classified by National Institutes of Health criteria. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes were abstracted by centrally trained and certified perinatal research staff. We evaluated trends in maternal characteristics and outcomes across COVID-19 severity classes and associations between severity and outcomes by multivariable modeling. RESULTS: A total of 1,219 patients were included: 47% asymptomatic, 27% mild, 14% moderate, 8% severe, 4% critical. Overall, 53% were Hispanic; there was no trend in race–ethnicity distribution by disease severity. Those with more severe illness had older mean age, higher median body mass index, and pre-existing medical comorbidities. Four maternal deaths (0.3%) were attributed to COVID-19. Frequency of perinatal death or a positive neonatal SARS-CoV-2 test result did not differ by severity. Adverse perinatal outcomes were more frequent among patients with more severe illness, including 6% (95% CI 2–11%) incidence of venous thromboembolism among those with severe–critical illness compared with 0.2% in mild–moderate and 0% in asymptomatic (P<.001 for trend across severity). In adjusted analyses, severe–critical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of cesarean birth (59.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.30–1.90), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (40.4% vs 18.8%, aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18–2.20), and preterm birth (41.8% vs 11.9%, aRR 3.53, 95% CI 2.42–5.14) compared with asymptomatic patients.

"BACKGROUND: High sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hs-TnT) has been associated with mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We aimed to determine if hs-TnT levels and their timing are independent predictors of adverse events in these patients. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review was performed for all patients hospitalized at our institution between 23 March 2020 and 13 April 2020 who were found to be COVID-19-positive. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory variables including initial and peak hs-TnT were recorded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were completed for a primary composite endpoint of in-hospital death, intubation, need for critical care, or cardiac arrest. RESULTS: In the 276 patients analysed, initial hs-TnT above the median (&#8805;17 ng/L) was associated with increased length of stay, need for vasoactive medications, and death, along with the composite endpoint (OR 3.92, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that elevated initial hs-TnT was independently associated with the primary endpoint (OR 2.92, p = 0.01). Late-peaking hs-TnT (OR 2.19 for each additional day until peak, p < 0.001) was also independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hs-TnT identifies patients at high risk for adverse in-hospital events, and trends of hs-TnT over time, particularly during the first day, provide additional prognostic information.",High sensitivity Troponin-T for prediction of adverse events in patients with COVID-19

"BACKGROUND: Ehealth platforms, since the outbreak of COVID-19 more important than ever, can support self-management in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The aim of this observational study is to explore the impact of healthcare professional involvement on the adherence of patients to an eHealth platform. We evaluated the usage of an eHealth platform by patients who used the platform individually compared with patients in a blended setting, where healthcare professionals were involved. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, log data from September 2011 until January 2018 were extracted from the eHealth platform Curavista. Patients with COPD who completed at least one Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were included for analyses (n = 299). In 57% (n = 171) of the patients, the eHealth platform was used in a blended setting, either in hospital (n = 128) or primary care (n = 29). To compare usage of the platform between patients who used the platform independently or with a healthcare professional, we applied propensity score matching and performed adjusted Poisson regression analysis on CCQ-submission rate. RESULTS: Using the eHealth platform in a blended setting was associated with a 3.25 higher CCQ-submission rate compared to patients using the eHealth platform independently. Within the blended setting, the CCQ-submission rate was 1.83 higher in the hospital care group than in the primary care group. CONCLUSION: It is shown that COPD patients used the platform more frequently in a blended care setting compared to patients who used the eHealth platform independently, adjusted for age, sex and disease burden. Blended care seems essential for adherence to eHealth programs in COPD, which in turn may improve self-management.",The impact of the involvement of a healthcare professional on the usage of an eHealth platform: a retrospective observational COPD study
"Background: Master’s students have been affected by COVID-19 and the changing study conditions due to the lockdown. The aim was to uncover changes in emotions, coping strategies, and psychological well-being during a pandemic. Methods: Ryff scale, multidimensional emotion questionnaire, and Brief COPE scale. Participants: sample of 118 master’s students after the first wave and 128 master’s students after the second wave. Results: After the second wave of COVID-19, the happy, enthusiastic, and inspired scores of the emotion construct components increased statistically significantly (p < 0.05), but the scores of the components sad, afraid, angry, ashamed, and anxious decreased significantly (p < 0.05). After the first wave, students commonly used planning, positive reframing, self-blame, humor, and acceptance coping strategies, which are classified as problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. The psychological well-being of master’s students after the second wave was statistically (p < 0.05) better than that after the first wave in many indicators. Environment mastery skills did not change significantly. Significant associations were revealed between the same components of psychological well-being, emotion, and coping strategies. Conclusions: This study showed that the master’s students improved their adaptive abilities probably in the environment of long-term exposure to coronavirus disease, as most psychological well-being indicators improved significantly after the second wave.","The Emotions, Coping, and Psychological Well-Being in Time of COVID-19: Case of Master’s Students"
"Emerging research on the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the labor effects of the crisis in the Global South Developing countries show high levels of labor informality, where most workers cannot work from home and depend on daily income In addition, the scarce and late state aid makes it difficult for workers to cope with the economic hardships caused by the pandemic This research explores the employment trajectories of workers throughout the ongoing pandemic in Chile: a neoliberal country with a strong male breadwinner culture and high levels of income inequality Using longitudinal non-probabilistic data for Chilean employment, this study finds that men lost their jobs to a lesser extent and returned to the labor market faster than women Likewise, male workers with family (with a partner and young children) remained employed in a higher proportion than female workers with family, and most of these women shifted from employment into care work The existing literature already pointed out how economic crises can have adverse effects on progress towards gender equality, and the current economic crisis seems to be no exception Labor informality and low-skilled jobs were highly related to unemployment during the first months of COVID in Chile These are important variables in a developing economy such as Chile, where around one-third of the population works under these conditions This article concludes by reflecting on the importance of addressing the present crisis and future economic recovery with a gender perspective",Between Social Protests and a Global Pandemic: Working Transitions under the Economic Effects of COVID-19

"The global economy has been hit by the unexpected COVID-19 outbreak, and foreign investment has been seen as one of the most important tools to boost the economy. However, in the highly uncertain post-epidemic era, determining how to attract foreign investment is the key to revitalizing the economy. What are the important factors for governments to attract investment, and how to improve them? This will be an important decision in the post-epidemic era. Therefore, this study develops a novel decision-making model to explore the key factors in attracting foreign investment. The model first uses fuzzy Delphi to explore the key factors of attracting foreign investment in the post-epidemic era, and then uses DEMATEL to construct the causal relationships among these factors. To overcome the uncertainty of various information sources and inconsistent messages from decision-makers, this study combined neutrosophic set theory to conduct quantitative analysis. The results of the study show that the model is suitable for analyzing the key factors of investment attraction in the post-epidemic period. Based on the results of the study, we also propose strategies that will help the relevant policy-making departments to understand the root causes of the problem and to formulate appropriate investment strategies in advance. In addition, the model is also used for comparative analysis, which reveals that this novel approach can integrate more incomplete information and present expert opinions in a more objective way.",The Key Success Factors for Attracting Foreign Investment in the Post-Epidemic Era
"A 15-month prospective longitudinal study of diarrhea and rotavirus (RV) infection was conducted concurrently in infants and toddlers in day care centers (DCCs) and in a large pediatric clinic in Houston. The mean number of children in the DCCs was 223; the diarrhea rate during the first 12 months was 2.62 episodes per child-year. Rotavirus accounted for approximately 10% of the total episodes of diarrhea in the pediatric clinic and DCC populations, but 50% during the winter months. The occurrence of RV in the DCCs paralleled that seen in the pediatric clinic. The annual rate of RV infection in DCCs was 0.55 episodes per child-year, with diarrhea occurring in only 40% of the episodes (0.22 episodes per child-year). There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community. The age distributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infections in DCC study children were not significantly different. In symptomatic RV-infected children in DCCs, 42% had RV identified in stool specimens within 2 days before diarrhea occurred. Thirty-eight DCC children had more than one episode of RV infection, but only five had two symptomatic RV infections. Diarrhea caused by RV is common in children in DCCs, often occurs in outbreaks due to the same strain, and parallels disease in the community; asymptomatic RV infection is also common in children in DCCs.",Rotavirus in infant-toddler day care centers: Epidemiology relevant to disease control strategies()
"AIMS: To report the effect of simultaneous intravitreal dexamethasone (DEX) and aflibercept for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). METHODS: This retrospective analysis of an open-label, multicenter, consecutive case series included 102 eyes of 81 patients with DME. Patients were selected into two groups. The control group consisted of 50 eyes treated with aflibercept alone, and the combination group consisted of 52 eyes treated with simultaneous DEX implant and aflibercept injection. The primary endpoints were changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to month 6. The secondary endpoint was the interval of retreatment. RESULTS: Baseline BCVA increased and CRT decreased at 6 months in both groups. Pseudophakic eyes in the combination group exhibited significantly greater BCVA improvement compared with phakic eyes (p = 0.031). Fewer intravitreal treatments were required for eyes treated with combination therapy than for those treated with aflibercept alone (1.56 ± 0.54 vs. 4.04 ± 1.26, p < .0001), with a mean retreatment interval of 3.66 ± 0.69 months. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous intravitreal DEX and aflibercept achieved non-inferior improvement of visual and anatomic outcomes compared with aflibercept alone for DME, but exhibited a significantly longer treatment interval and superior visual outcome in pseudophakic eyes. This therapeutic approach is considered a valid strategy for treating DME in the era of COVID-19.",Therapeutic effect of simultaneous intravitreal dexamethasone and aflibercept on diabetic macular edema
"BACKGROUND China's emergency management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was heavily criticized, whereas the H7N9 response was praised by the international community.AimsThe aims of this study were to examine and compare the strengths and weaknesses of risk communication conducted in response to SARS and H7N9 and their associated social impacts on affected communities in China. METHOD A qualitative comparative case study approach was employed in the present study, using a set of 8 risk communication principles selected from international literature to suit the Chinese context for the comparative analysis of emergency responses of SARS and H7N9. RESULTS The study found significant differences in the risk communication conducted in the 2 cases. The SARS outbreak fully exposed China's lack of experience in public health risk communication. By contrast, the Chinese government's risk communication strategies had improved significantly during the H7N9 outbreak.DiscussionTrust is the basis for communication. Maintaining an open and honest attitude and actively engaging stakeholders to address their risk information needs will serve to build trust and facilitate multi-sector collaborations in dealing with a public health crisis. CONCLUSIONS From SARS to H7N9, risk communication practices in China greatly improved, which, in turn, lessened adverse social impacts and improved outcomes in emergency management of public health crises.

"Little remains known about the degree to which autistic university students are stigmatized relative to students with other diagnoses. We conducted an online survey with students in New York City (n = 633) and Beirut (n = 274). Students with diagnoses that were perceived as dangerous (e.g., psychopathy) were more stigmatized than students with diagnoses that were perceived as less dangerous (e.g., autism). Disruptive autistic behaviors (described via vignettes) evoked more stigma than withdrawn behaviors. Perceived dangerousness predicted autism stigma. Greater acceptance of inequality, less openness, and lower cognitive empathy co-occurred with heightened stigma towards most conditions. Diagnostic labels were typically less stigmatized than behaviors. Findings suggest that interventions are needed to decrease stigma towards varied diagnoses in collegiate communities.

"Objectives: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic currently spreading rapidly across the United States. We provide a comprehensive look at COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Georgia, which includes vast rural communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this infectious disease. Methods: All 159 Georgia counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 in Georgia from March 3 through April 24, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and mortality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted county-level mortality rates per 100,000 population (MRs) by county-level factors. Results: Metropolitan Atlanta had the overall highest number of confirmed cases; however, the southwestern rural parts of Georgia, surrounding the city of Albany, had the highest bi-weekly increases in incidence rate. Among counties with >10 cases, MRs were highest in the rural counties of Randolph (233.2), Terrell (182.5), Early (136.3), and Dougherty (114.2). Counties with the highest MRs (22.5-2332 per 100,000) had a higher proportion of: non-Hispanic Blacks residents, adults aged 60+, adults earning <$20,000 annually, and residents living in rural communities when compared with counties with lower MRs. These counties also had a lower proportion of the population with a college education, lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and lower number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population. Conclusions: While urban centers in Georgia account for the bulk of COVID-19 cases, high mortality rates and low critical care capacity in rural Georgia are also of critical concern.",Epidemiology of the 2020 pandemic of COVID-19 in the state of Georgia: Inadequate critical care resources and impact after 7 weeks of community spread

"BACKGROUND Urolithiasis in small ruminants has a poor long-term prognosis, and long-term clinical outcomes are variable and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES To assess the accuracy of preoperative and postoperative blood l-lactate concentrations in predicting a negative outcome in goats undergoing tube cystostomy. ANIMALS Thirty-four male goats undergoing tube cystostomy. METHODS Retrospective study. Medical records of goats undergoing tube cystostomy from 2015 to 2020 were reviewed. Clinical variables recorded included signalment, procedures before surgery, urolith location and type, duration of hospitalization, and heart rate. PCV, plasma total protein, potassium, preoperative and postoperative blood l-lactate concentrations, preoperative and postoperative creatinine concentrations, and relative changes in blood l-lactate and creatinine concentrations over time were measured using heparinized blood. A negative outcome was defined as death or euthanasia from urolithiasis complications at 6 months after discharge. Negative outcomes as a function of independent clinical variables were evaluated using χ2 or Fisher's exact tests, and multivariate logistic regression. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS Median (95% confidence interval) preoperative, postoperative, and the relative change over time of blood l-lactate concentrations were 3.3 mmol/L (2.2, 4.8), 1.0 mmol/L (0.7, 1.3), and 0.4 mmol/L (-3.5, 3.2), respectively. Preoperative (P = 1), postoperative (P = .14), and the relative change over time (P = .63) of blood l-lactate concentrations were not significant predictors of a negative outcome. Furthermore, all other clinical variables measured were not significant predictors of a negative outcome (P > .05).

CASE PRESENTATION We describe a 58-year-old white man who presented with a 1-year history of gait disturbance with disequilibrium leading to falls. We report an association between parkinsonism and presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies in his cerebrospinal fluid, discussing clinical presentation and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Besides the possibility of a casual association, this case allows us to hypothesize an alternative pathophysiological mechanism of parkinsonism implying interference with glutamic acid decarboxylase and gamma-aminobutyric acid functions, eventually resulting in basal ganglia circuit dysregulation.",Atypical parkinsonism and intrathecal anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies - an unusual association: a case report.
"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global crisis and is more devastating than any other previous infectious disease. It has affected a significant proportion of the global population both physically and mentally, and destroyed businesses and societies. Current evidence suggested that immunopathology may be responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) response, antibody-dependent enhancement, and especially, cytokine storm (CS). The CS is characterized by hyperproduction of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is closely associated with poor prognosis. These excessively secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate different inflammatory signaling pathways via their receptors on immune and tissue cells, resulting in complicated medical symptoms including fever, capillary leak syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death in the most severe cases. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the initiation and signaling pathways of CS to develop more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the latest developments in the immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 and focus on CS including the current research status of the different cytokines involved. We also discuss the induction, function, downstream signaling, and existing and potential interventions for targeting these cytokines or related signal pathways. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of CS in COVID-19 will help to develop better strategies to effectively control immunopathology in this disease and other infectious and inflammatory diseases.",The signal pathways and treatment of cytokine storm in COVID-19
"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AFib) represents the most common arrhythmia in the general population, Its prevalence is progressively increasing and currently is estimated around 3-4% and accounts for about 1.5% of all the admissions to our emergency departments (ED). Aim of the study: During the first wave of COVID 19 a significant decrease of Hospital admissions for several cardiovascular conditions was observed, The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the incidence of new onset AFib admitted to our Regional Hospital Network during the first COVID wave. Methods: We analyzed all the Hospital admissions for AFib as major diagnosis through the data base of Agenzia Regionale di Sanità Toscana. We compared the 2020 data with those of 2018 and 2019. Results: Compared to the previous two years we observed an absolute reduction of-51% in AFIb ED accesses and Hospitalizations during the lock-down period (March-55.2%, April-54.9%, May-34.3%) (FIG 1). A reduction was also observed in the following months although to a lesser extent. Female gender, particulraly the youngest showed the greatest reduction. AFib patients admitted to the ED were more frequently admitted to the ward with respect to 2019 (15.6% vs 13.9%). We also detected a significant reduction of reported ischemic stroke that reached-24.7% on April 2020 (FIG 2). Conclusions: Our data, show a significant reduction of AFib incidence in the Regional Hospital Network during the first COVID 19 wave. The observed pattern may depend on several causes. The forced lockdown may have caused a true reduction in the AFib incidence due to a diminished exposure to favouring or predisposing factors. A second explanation may be the fear of public contacts or reluctancy to access to the Emergency wards and Hospitals seen as possible source of viral infection. The contemporary reduction of ischemic stroke occurrence or death and AFib incidence may suggest a positive effect of the lock-down on these conditions, at least over the short term. It is highly unlikely that patients with an acute condition such as AFib or stroke would not seek medical attention to such a wide extent as that observed. It appears worrisome the observed relative increase in Hospital admission of AFib patients during the lock down. Indeed, this pattern may reflect a delayed access to the necessary care with the progression to more severe complications and subsequent need of a prolonged care.",Incidence of atrial fibrillation in tuscany during the first wave of the covid 19 pandemy
"COVID-19 outbreak is major pandemic affecting lakhs of people all across the globe. Along with other nonspecific clinical features, reports mention anosmia to be an important symptom in COVID-19 positive patients. To study the prevalence of anosmia in confirmed COVID-19 patients, in Indian population and to ascertain its significance as a symptom of COVID 19. Study was done at a tertiary care COVID treating hospital. While eliciting detailed history from Covid-19 positive patients, all patients were asked about symptom of anosmia. Same was asked from control group of subjects who were COVID-19 negative. The history of anosmia was also elicited on discharge after the patients tested negative for COVID-19. 74 patients formed part of the study. 11 of 74 (14.8%) patients had anosmia. On using the chi square test for significance the difference was significant (p < .01), suggesting anosmia to be a significant clinical feature in COVID-19 patients. On comparing with world literature it was observed that the prevalence of anosmia is higher in European population as compared to Indian Also the symptom of anosmia improved when the patient recovered from the disease. Prevalence of new onset anosmia in Indian population with COVID-19 is 14.8%. Symptom of anosmia in present times should be considered as a important clinical feature and should raise a suspicion of COVID-19.

"Lockdown measures during COVID-19 have presented increased challenges in the home and family responsibilities. Single mothers may face unique challenges as they may be isolated from external family supports. Changes on a 19-item home and family work role survey pre- and post-COVID were tested with a paired t-test and sign test; the impact of age and people in the home was assessed using linear regression. There was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in 6/19 post-COVID-19 family responsibilities. In comparison to pre-COVID-19, post-COVID-19 single mothers reported a statistically significant median increase in family responsibilities (Mdn = .0000), p < .041. Each additional person living in the home was associated with a decrease in family responsibilities (B = -13.1, 95% CI [-21.943, -4.247]).

"Clinical assessment of the patient who has smell and taste disorders requires understanding of the etiology of the olfactory and gustatory disorders. Available clinical tests of olfactory and gustatory systems allow detecting and measuring the degree of the sensory loss, but are unable to determine the cause and give neither prognostic information nor therapeutic guidance. With physical examination, however, clinical history can help to establish the diagnosis and guide the treatment if available. A clinician evaluating a patient who has smell and taste loss must understand that ""taste"" complaints usually are symptoms of an olfactory dysfunction. The distinction between true gustatory loss (bitter, sweet, salty, sour, or umami) and olfactory loss, the inability to perceive complex flavors of food, will help clarify the patient's diagnosis.

"Q fever and rickettsial diseases occur throughout the world and appear to be emergent zoonoses in Chile. The diagnosis of these diseases is currently uncommon in Chile, as their clinical presentations are non-specific and appropriate diagnostic laboratory assays are of limited availability. During a recent outbreak of undiagnosed human atypical pneumonia, we serologically investigated a series of 357 cases from three regions of southern Chile. The aim was to identify those caused by Coxiella burnetii and/or Rickettsia spp. Serological analysis was performed by ELISA and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for acute and convalescence sera of patients. Our results, including data from two international reference laboratories, demonstrate that 71 (20%) of the cases were Q fever, and 44 (15%) were a likely rickettsial infection, although the rickettsial species could not be confirmed by serology. This study is the first report of endemic Q fever and rickettsial disease affecting humans in Chile.",Evidence of Q Fever and Rickettsial Disease in Chile
"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed a great burden on critical care services worldwide. Data regarding critically ill COVID-19 patients and their demand of critical care services outside of initial COVID-19 epicenters are lacking. This study described clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients and the capacity of a COVID-19-dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) in Kobe, Japan. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to a 14-bed COVID-19-dedicated ICU in Kobe between March 3, 2020 and June 21, 2020. Clinical and daily ICU occupancy data were obtained from electrical medical records. The last follow-up day was June 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of 32 patients included, the median hospital follow-up period was 27 (interquartile range 19-50) days. The median age was 68 (57-76) years; 23 (72%) were men and 25 (78%) had at least one comorbidity. Nineteen (59%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 14 (8-27) days. Until all patients were discharged from the ICU on June 5, 2020, the median daily ICU occupancy was 50% (36-71%). As of June 28, 2020, six (19%) died during hospitalization. Of 26 (81%) survivors, 23 (72%) were discharged from the hospital and three (9%) remained in the hospital. CONCLUSION: During the first months of the outbreak in Kobe, most critically ill patients were men aged &#8805; 60 years with at least one comorbidity and on mechanical ventilation; the ICU capacity was not strained, and the case-fatality rate was 19%.","Clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Kobe, Japan: a single-center, retrospective, observational study"
"The intrinsic plasticity of RNA viruses can facilitate host range changes that lead to epidemics. However, evolutionary processes promoting cross-species transfers are poorly defined, especially for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In theory, cross species transfers by arboviruses may be constrained by their alternating infection of disparate hosts, where optimal replication in one host involves a fitness tradeoff for the other. Accordingly, freeing arboviruses from alternate replication via specialization in a single host should accelerate adaptation. This hypothesis has been tested by using cell culture model systems with inconclusive results. Therefore, we tested it using an in vivo system with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an emerging alphavirus of the Americas. VEEV serially passaged in mosquitoes exhibited increased mosquito infectivity and vertebrate-specialized strains produced higher viremias. Conversely, alternately passaged VEEV experienced no detectable fitness gains in either host. These results suggest that arbovirus adaptation and evolution is limited by obligate host alternation and predict that arboviral emergence via host range changes may be less frequent than that of single host animal RNA viruses.",Arbovirus evolution in vivo is constrained by host alternation.
"The How Right Now communication initiative (HRN) was developed to facilitate resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. HRN was designed as a conduit for promoting mental health and addressing feelings of grief, worry, and stress experienced during this time. This article provides an overview of the rapid, mixed-method, culturally responsive formative research process undertaken to inform the development of HRN. Specifically, it describes how HRN's disproportionately affected audiences (adults aged 65 and older and their caregivers, adults with preexisting physical and mental health conditions, adults experiencing violence, and adults experiencing economic distress) describe and discuss emotional resilience, what they need to be resilient, and what factors contribute to the perceptions of their ability to ""bounce back"" from the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection methods included an environmental scan (n >= 700 publications), social listening (n >= 1 million social media posts), partner needs-assessment calls (n = 16), partner-convened listening sessions with community members (n = 29), online focus groups (n = 58), and a national probability survey (n = 731), all in English and Spanish. Results revealed that HRN's audiences have diverse perceptions of what constitutes resilience. However, common factors were identified across populations to support resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including informal and formal social support and access to services to meet basic needs, including food and housing resources. Stress, anxiety, depression, and experience with stigma and discrimination were also linked to resilience. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of disproportionately affected populations is vital to identifying supports and services, including the engagement of community stakeholders.",How Right Now?

"Viral pneumonia has a significant effect on the cardiovascular system through various mechanisms; even though it is traditionally regarded as a pulmonary disease characterized by dyspnoea and hypoxaemia. Recent research works have shown that cardiovascular events outweigh all other causes of death in various influenza pandemics. Therefore, the exploration of the effects of viral pneumonia on cardiovascular system becomes increasingly essential. The objective of this review is three-fold: first, to summarize the knowledge about the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of viral infections that are the recent causes of global pandemics; second, to explore the cardiovascular response to these infections; and third, to attempt in identifying the possible coping strategies of the Wuhan epidemic and the future viral infection pandemics.",Deleterious effects of viral pneumonia on cardiovascular system
"As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.",A mathematical model for simulating the transmission of Wuhan novel Coronavirus
"Predicting who will benefit from admission to an intensive care unit is not straightforward and admission processes vary. Our aim was to understand how decisions to admit or not are made. We observed 55 decision-making events in six NHS hospitals. We interviewed 30 referring and 43 intensive care doctors about these events. We describe the nature and context of the decision-making and analysed how doctors make intensive care admission decisions. Such decisions are complex with intrinsic uncertainty, often urgent and made with incomplete information. While doctors aspire to make patient-centred decisions, key challenges include: being overworked with lack of time; limited support from senior staff; and a lack of adequate staffing in other parts of the hospital that may be compromising patient safety. To reduce decision complexity, heuristic rules based on experience are often used to help think through the problem; for example, the patient's functional status or clinical gestalt. The intensive care doctors actively managed relationships with referring doctors; acted as the hospital generalist for acutely ill patients; and brought calm to crisis situations. However, they frequently failed to elicit values and preferences from patients or family members. They were rarely explicit in balancing burdens and benefits of intensive care for patients, so consistency and equity cannot be judged. The use of a framework for intensive care admission decisions that reminds doctors to seek patient or family views and encourages explicit balancing of burdens and benefits could improve decision-making. However, a supportive, adequately resourced context is also needed.",Decision-making around admission to intensive care in the UK pre-COVID-19: a multicentre ethnographic study.
"Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were included among high-risk groups for more severe manifestations in case of COVID-19 infection and higher risk of mortality. The current study aims to (1) examine the relationship between death obsession, religiosity, and fear of COVID-19 among type 2 diabetes patients, and (2) assess if religiosity moderates the relationship between death obsession and fear of COVID-19. This cross-sectional online survey involved 306 type 2 diabetes patients. We found that 35.6 % of the participants were overweight and 14.6 % were suffering from obesity. Results showed that death obsession was positively associated with fear of COVID-19 and more religious individuals experience higher levels of fear. The overall level of religiosity did not moderate the relationship between death obsession and fear of COVID-19 but only the preoccupation with God dimension of the religiosity scale. The practical implications of these findings are discussed.","Death Obsession, COVID-19–Related Fear and Religiosity in People Living with Type 2 Diabetes"
"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the daily lives of millions of people around the world, substantially increasing anxiety and stress levels for many. Psychological capital (PsyCap), a multidimensional construct that includes hope, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy, may serve as a resource for helping people more effectively cope with uncertainty resulting in lower levels of perceived stress. The authors hypothesize a negative relationship between PsyCap and perceived stress that is partially and differentially mediated by adaptive and maladaptive coping styles. The authors further hypothesize that work context (home vs workplace) will moderate the relationships between coping styles and perceived stress. Design/methodology/approach After receiving Institutional Review Board approval, data were collected during the first week of May 2020 using an online survey. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, specifically Mplus 8. The authors validated their initial findings using PROCESS Model 14 with 5,000 boot-strapped samples and a 95% confidence interval. Findings The authors' results show that adaptive and maladaptive coping styles differentially mediate the effects of PsyCap on perceived stress with the indirect effects of PsyCap on perceived stress through maladaptive coping being stronger than the indirect effects through adaptive coping. The authors found support for the relationships in our hypothesized model. Practical implications The authors' findings suggest that health interventions aimed at increasing PsyCap may be an effective means of reducing maladaptive coping and perceived stress. Future research should continue to explore PsyCap as a potential means of shaping positive health behaviors. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution to the literature by explaining how PsyCap operates through coping to affect perceptions of stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Coping with the crisis: the effects of psychological capital and coping behaviors on perceived stress
"Interferons (IFNs) have been used to treat mucosal lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, such as intraepithelial precursor lesions to cancer of the uterine cervix, genital warts or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, to potentially reduce or eliminate replicating HPV plasmid genomes. Mucosal HPVs have evolved mechanisms that impede IFN-β synthesis and downregulate genes induced by IFN. Here we show that these HPV types directly subvert a cellular transcriptional response to IFN-β as a potential boost in infection. Treatment with low levels of human IFN-β induced initial amplification of HPV-16 and HPV-11 plasmid genomes and increased HPV-16 or HPV-31 DNA copy numbers up to 6-fold in HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. IFN treatment also increased early gene transcription from the major early gene promoters in HPV-16, HPV-31 and HPV-11. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the viral genomes and ectopic interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression in transfection experiments using IRF-1 (−/−) , IRF-2 (−/−) and dual knockout cell lines determined that these responses are due to the activation of IRF-1 interaction with a conserved interferon response element demonstrated in several mucosal HPV early gene promoters. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the varying clinical outcomes of IFN therapy of papillomatoses and define an assay for the modulation of the HPV gene program by IFNs as well as other cytokines and signaling molecules in infection and therapy.",Interferon-beta treatment increases human papillomavirus early gene transcription and viral plasmid genome replication by activating interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1
"BACKGROUND: Continuing professional development (CPD) continues to gain acceptance as a model for health care professionals to engage in lifelong learning (LLL). Many pharmacy schools have not adopted yet specific programs targeting the development of LLL skills, though LLL is widely accepted as an essential competence. This paper examines the effectiveness and utility of a longitudinal CPD training program. METHODS: A CPD simulation course was introduced to a cohort of fifth year students in Northern Cyprus in the 2018–2019 academic year. The program was delivered as an interactive orientation course in one semester; meanwhile, in the second semester, the students applied the CPD cycle and completed their portfolios during their final experiential practice. A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the outcomes of the intervention using students’ preparedness for lifelong learning (SPLLL) self-administered questionnaire delivered pre-post program, focus group sessions for students to reflect on the course experience, and instructors’ evaluations of portfolios. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the course, students’ assessment scores were significantly higher overall and for all scale domains, including “knowledge, skills, attitude and practice”, compared to the baseline assessment. Additionally, compared to fifth year students who responded to the second SPLLL questionnaire, the intervention group students’ assessment was significantly higher in knowledge, skills, and practice. The qualitative analysis reported high student satisfaction and achievement of the course objectives. Nineteen of the students scored high on their portfolios. CONCLUSION: The CPD simulation course provided students with opportunities to practice and develop self-assessment and self-management skills that are all desirable for lifelong learning and prepared them for CPD.",Preparing lifelong learners for delivering pharmaceutical care in an ever-changing world: a study of pharmacy students
"Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce lower airway infections requiring hospitalization, and reduce mortality and exacerbation frequency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), and therefore is recommended for all COPD patients by guidelines. However, the coverage of influenza vaccination in Chinese COPD patients is far from satisfactory. The large-scale COVID-19 vaccination may have a positive impact on the attitude towards influenza vaccines, and healthcare professionals should take active measures to improve the rate of influenza vaccination in patients with COPD.",[Focus on influenza vaccination in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]
"There is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs and alleviate the current COVID‐19 pandemic. Herein we report the design and construction of chimeric oligonucleotides comprising a 2′‐OMe‐modified antisense oligonucleotide and a 5′‐phosphorylated 2′‐5′ poly(A)4 (4A2‐5) to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS‐CoV‐2. The oligonucleotide was used for searching and recognizing target viral RNA sequence, and the conjugated 4A2‐5 was used for guided RNase L activation to sequence‐specifically degrade viral RNAs. Since RNase L can potently cleave single‐stranded RNA during innate antiviral response, degradation efficiencies with these chimeras were twice as much as those with only antisense oligonucleotides for both SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, chimera‐S4 achieved potent and broad‐spectrum inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 and its N501Y and/or ΔH69/ΔV70 mutants, indicating a promising antiviral agent based on the nucleic acid‐hydrolysis targeting chimera (NATAC) strategy.",Efficient Inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 Using Chimeric Antisense Oligonucleotides through RNase L Activation
"We investigated pandemic denial in the general public in Germany after the first wave of COVID-19 in May 2020. Using latent class analysis, we compared patterns of disagreement with claims about (a) the origin, spread, or infectiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and (b) the personal risk from COVID-19 between scientific laypersons (N = 1,575) and scientific experts (N = 128). Two groups in the general public differed distinctively from expert evaluations. The Dismissive (8%) are characterized by low-risk assessment, low compliance with containment measures, and mistrust in politicians. The Doubtful (19%) are characterized by low cognitive reflection, high uncertainty in the distinction between true and false claims, and high social media intake. Our research indicates that pandemic denial cannot be linked to a single and distinct pattern of psychological dispositions but involves different subgroups within the general population that share high COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and low beliefs in epistemic complexity.",Psychological underpinnings of pandemic denial - patterns of disagreement with scientific experts in the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic
"In silico techniques helped explore the binding capacities of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) for a series of metalloorganic compounds. Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound. It was tested along with 20 other vanadium-containing complexes from the literature in a virtual screening test by docking against the inhibition of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.",Are vanadium complexes druggable against the main protease mpro of sars-cov-2? - a computational approach
"The aim of the present study is to perform an anonymous, quantitative and descriptive analysis about the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in oral care professionals in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands, during the confinement of the copulation and the beginning of the deescalated. For this, an online self-filling survey was used. It was sento to the oral care professionals working in the Balearic Islands. Dentists and stomatologists (DS), superior technicians in oral hygiene (OH) and superior techniclans in dental prosthesis (DP). The oral care professionals received and answered the survey in the period between June 1st and 30th 2020, using a form served through the Google Forms Gsutt application. 148 professionals responded to the survey, of which 4% reported a positive serology to COVID-19. All positive professionals were from Mallorca and from urban (83,3%) and semi-urban areas (16,6%). Significantly more OH (76%) and DP (88%) did not undergone the COVID test in comparison with DS (49%, p = 0.0008). There was no statistically significant difference between the different professionals regarding the fear of contracting the virus. There was also no statistically significant diference between the type of mask (p=0.6166) used by the professionals.

"Countries have implemented control programmes (CPs) for cattle diseases such as bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) that are tailored to each country-specific situation. Practical methods are needed to assess the output of these CPs in terms of the confidence of freedom from infection that is achieved. As part of the STOC free project, a Bayesian Hidden Markov model was developed, called STOC free model, to estimate the probability of infection at herd-level. In the current study, the STOC free model was applied to BVDV field data in four study regions, from CPs based on ear notch samples. The aim of this study was to estimate the probability of herd-level freedom from BVDV in regions that are not (yet) free. We additionally evaluated the sensitivity of the parameter estimates and predicted probabilities of freedom to the prior distributions for the different model parameters. First, default priors were used in the model to enable comparison of model outputs between study regions. Thereafter, country-specific priors based on expert opinion or historical data were used in the model, to study the influence of the priors on the results and to obtain country-specific estimates. The STOC free model calculates a posterior value for the model parameters (e.g. herd-level test sensitivity and specificity, probability of introduction of infection) and a predicted probability of infection. The probability of freedom from infection was computed as one minus the probability of infection. For dairy herds that were considered free from infection within their own CP, the predicted probabilities of freedom were very high for all study regions ranging from 0.98 to 1.00, regardless of the use of default or country-specific priors. The priors did have more influence on two of the model parameters, herd-level sensitivity and the probability of remaining infected, due to the low prevalence and incidence of BVDV in the study regions. The advantage of STOC free model compared to scenario tree modelling, the reference method, is that actual data from the CP can be used and estimates are easily updated when new data becomes available.",Output-based assessment of herd-level freedom from infection in endemic situations: Application of a Bayesian Hidden Markov model
"Globally, 4.2% population suffer from heart failure. The condition has a mortality rate between 56% and 78%. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 and became a pandemic since March 11, 2020. As COVID-19 emerges, cardiovascular disorders including, heart failure, become one of the most common comorbidity that increase the risk for contracting the disease. Heart failure and COVID-19 have reciprocal relationship. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk for COVID-19 with more unfavorable outcome. COVID-19 itself may deteriorate pre-existing heart failure in the subject. This situation is mediated by the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in cardiac myocytes and pericytes, direct effect of viral invasion to myocytes and pericytes, downregulation of ACE-2 which hampers cardiovascular function, and uncontrolled inflammation known as cytokine storm. Prudent management, including implementation of telemedicine, continuation of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker, and medications’ side effects monitoring, is important in managing patients with coexisting heart failure and COVID-19.",Heart failure and coronavirus disease-19
"The non-structural protein 7 (nsp7) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses was selected as a new target to potentially interfere with viral replication. The nsp7s are uniquely conserved small coronavirus proteins having a critical, yet intriguing participation on the replication of the long viral RNA genome after complexing with nsp8 and nsp12. Drugs with potential to interfere with nsp7s have not been described yet. Despite the difficulties of having no previously defined binding pocket, high-throughput blind screening of more than one hundred thousand natural compounds < 400 Dalton of molecular weight docked against the nsp7.1ysy conformer identified hundreds of leads displaying predicted high binding-affinities by AutoDockVina. The leads were then docked to 14 nsp7 available conformers by two different binding scoring algorithms ( AutoDockVina-PyRx and HYDE-seeSAR), to identify consensus top-leads. Further predictive analysis of their physiological/toxicity ADMET criteria (chemical properties, adsorption, metabolism, toxicity) narrowed top-leads to a few drug-like ligands, most of them showing steroid-like structures closely related to some of those being actually used in clinical work. A final optimization by search for structural similarities to the drug-like top-lead, yielded a collection of novel steroid-like ligands with ~100-fold higher-affinity whose antiviral activity may be experimentally validated since they are available. Additionally, these nsp7-interacting ligands and/or their further optimized derivatives, may offer new tools to investigate the intriguing role of nsp7 on replication of coronaviruses",In silico screening for natural ligands to non-structural nsp7 conformers of SARS coronaviruses

"Introduction: High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) have been widely used in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the impact of HFNC vs. NIV on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is uncertain. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of HFNC vs. NIV in COVID-19-related AHRF.Methods: Several electronic databases were searched through February 10, 2022, for eligible studies comparing between HFNC and NIV in COVID-19-related AHRF. Our primary outcome was intubation. The secondary outcomes were mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and PaO2/FiO2 ratio changes. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using a random-effect model. Prediction intervals (PI) were calculated to indicate the variance in outcomes that would be expected if new studies were conducted in the future.Results: Nineteen studies involving 3606 subjects (1880 received HFNC and 1726 received NIV) were included. There were no differences in intubation (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.20, P=0.89) or LOS (MD 0.38 days, 95% CI -0.61, 1.37, P=0.45) between groups with consistent results on the subgroup of RCTs. Mortality was lower in NIV (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.98, P=0.03). However, PI was 0.41-1.59, and subgroup analysis of RCTs showed no difference in mortality between groups. There was a greater improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio with NIV (MD 22.80, 95% CI 5.30-40.31, P=0.01).Conclusions: Our study showed that despite the greater improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio with NIV, the intubation and length of hospital stay were similar between HFNC and NIV. Although mortality was lower with HFNC than NIV, the prediction interval included the null value, and there was no difference in mortality between HFNC and NIV on a subgroup of RCTs. Future large-scale RCTs are necessary to prove our findings.",High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen versus Non-Invasive Ventilation in Subjects with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Comparative Studies

"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. We aimed to evaluate whether ABO and rhesus blood groups associate with the susceptibility or the severity of PUUV infection. We analyzed blood groups in 289 adult patients treated in Tampere University hospital due to PUUV infection during the years 1982–2017. Patients’ blood group distribution was compared to that of healthy, voluntary blood donors living in the Tampere University Hospital responsibility area (n = 21,833). The severity of PUUV infection, as judged by the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI), thrombocytopenia, inflammation, capillary leakage, and the length of hospital care, was analyzed across the groups. The ABO and rhesus blood group distributions did not differ between the patients and blood donors. Patients with non-O blood groups had lower systolic blood pressure compared to patients with blood group O, but there was no difference in other markers of capillary leakage or in the severity of AKI. Minor deviations in the number of platelets and leukocytes were detected between the O and non-O blood groups. To conclude, patients with blood group O may be less susceptible to hypotension, but otherwise blood groups have no major influences on disease susceptibility or severity during acute PUUV infection.",ABO and Rhesus Blood Groups in Acute Puumala Hantavirus Infection
"Assessing morphological, perfusion and metabolic brain changes preceding or associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) will help in the understanding of pathophysiological underlying processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aimed to highlight the main findings on significant associations between neuroimaging and NPSs, the pathophysiology to elucidate possible underlying mechanisms, and methodological issues to aid future research. Research papers published from January 1990 to October 2015 were identified in the databases PsycInfo, Embase, PubMed and Medline, using key words related to NPSs and imaging techniques. In addition to a semi-systematic search in the databases, we also performed hand searches based on reported citations identified to be of interest. Delusions, apathy and depression symptoms were particularly associated with brain changes in AD. The majority of studies disclosed an association between frontal lobe structural and/or metabolic changes and NPSs, implicating, interestingly, for all 12 NPSs studied, the anterior cingulate cortex although temporal, subcortical and parietal regions, and insula were also involved. Given the high degree of connectivity of these brain areas, frontal change correlates of NPSs may help in the understanding of neural network participation. This review also highlights crucial methodological issues that may reduce the heterogeneity of results to enable progress on the pathophysiological mechanisms and aid research on NPS treatments in AD. Based on a broad review of the current literature, a global brain pattern to support the huge heterogeneity of neuroimaging correlates of NPSs in AD and methodological strategies are suggested to help direct future research.",Neuroimaging correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: a review of 20 years of research.

"BACKGROUND: The circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic necessitated an alternate operations strategy for efficient patient management. Alternate care sites were a viable option for managing emergency department (ED) surge in previous epidemics and disasters. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the development of an alternate care site and evaluates efficiency by comparing key performance indicators between an ad hoc nested respiratory evaluation unit (NRU) within the ED and an alternate care site outside the ED. METHODS: This was a cohort study of 2 care models in the same ED during 2 different time periods. As coronavirus disease 2019 surged in March 2020, potential treat‐and‐release patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were triaged to a dedicated ED area (NRU). As ED volume grew, these low‐acuity patients were triaged to an ACS. We compared ED length of stay, elopement, and left without being evaluated rates and ED recidivism between the 2 care models: NRU patients presented to the ED from March 16, 2020, to March 31, 2020, and ACS patients presented from April 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020. Continuous variables were compared using independent t test or Mann‐Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using χ(2) test. RESULTS: There were 414 NRU patients and 146 alternate care site patients with no significant differences in sex or age. The mean ED length of stay was shorter for alternate care site patients: 155 versus 45 minutes (P < 0.01). Elopement and left without being evaluated rates were higher in the NRU. There was no significant difference in ED recidivism between groups: 10% versus 6% (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: An alternate care site provided an efficient resource for the evaluation of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.",Dedicated area within the emergency department versus an outside dedicated area for evaluation and management of suspected coronavirus disease 2019
"OBJECTIVES: According to the recent epidemiological studies, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) may be at higher risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. Regarding the important role of nutrition on the immunity, the present review article aimed to outline nutritional support of DM during the outbreak of COVID-19 with a mechanistic insight. METHODS: Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from 2000 until December 2020 using the following keywords. All relevant clinical and experimental studies published in English were included. RESULTS: Evidences revealed that hyperglycemia is a significant predictor of some viral infections including COVID-19 which can exacerbate the complications of DM. According to the literature review, adequate intake of dietary protein, fiber, essential fatty acids and some micronutrients especially vitamins D, C, B12, folate, zinc and selenium has beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in diabetic patients through modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses or direct effects on virus enzymes or the rate of cell entrance. CONCLUSIONS: It is well understood that malnutrition may increase susceptibility to viral infections and disease progression. Therefore, considering nutritional status of diabetic patients and reasonable supplementation of the above mentioned nutrients can ameliorate the symptoms of COVID-19 in DM. However, further well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine their therapeutic dose.",Nutritional management of diabetes mellitus during the pandemic of COVID-19: a comprehensive narrative review
"Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) are responsible for the generation of most immune cells throughout the lifespan of the organism. Inflammation can activate bone marrow HSPCs, leading to enhanced myelopoiesis to replace cells, such as neutrophils, which are attracted to inflamed tissues. We have previously shown that HSPC activation promotes parasite persistence and expansion in experimental visceral leishmaniasis through the increased production of permissive monocytes. However, it is not clear if the presence of the parasite in the bone marrow was required for infection-adapted myelopoiesis. We therefore hypothesized that persistent forms of Leishmania major (cutaneous leishmaniasis) could also activate HSPCs and myeloid precursors in the C57Bl/6 mouse model of intradermal infection in the ear. The accrued influx of myeloid cells to the lesion site corresponded to an increase in myeloid-biased HSPCs in the bone marrow and spleen in mice infected with a persistent strain of L. major, together with an increase in monocytes and monocyte-derived myeloid cells in the spleen. Analysis of the bone marrow cytokine and chemokine environment revealed an attenuated type I and type II interferon response in the mice infected with the persistent strain compared to the self-healing strain, while both strains induced a rapid upregulation of myelopoietic cytokines, such as IL-1β and GM-CSF. These results demonstrate that an active infection in the bone marrow is not necessary for the induction of infection-adapted myelopoiesis, and underline the importance of considering alterations to the bone marrow output when analyzing in vivo host-pathogen interactions.",Persistent Cutaneous Leishmania major Infection Promotes Infection-Adapted Myelopoiesis
"The study evaluated the antidiabetic potential of three traditional Indian red rice genotypes/RR (Kattuyanam/KA, Chennangi/CH & Karungkuruvai/KU) using a combination of in vitro, metabolomics (Quadrupole-Time of Flight-Liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry/Q-TOF-LC-MS/MS), and in silico techniques. In terms of antihyperglycemic potential, KA exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against α-amylase; CH against α-glucosidase; and KU against DPPIV and PTP1B enzymes. KA exhibited the highest antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS) and greater inhibition of protein glycation compared to other RR indicating its potential to mitigate diabetic complications. The metabolomic analysis confirmed the presence of 99 phenolics in the sample extracts (KU-71, KA-70, CH-68). Molecular docking studies revealed seven metabolites to be good inhibitors of the four target enzymes and activators of insulin receptor substrate/IRS. The antihyperglycemic and oxidation-glycation reduction composite index revealed KA to have the highest overall antidiabetic potential. Hence, the RR could be utilized in functional foods with a multi-barrelled strategy for diabetes prevention/management.","Multi-Mechanistic In Vitro Evaluation of Antihyperglycemic, Antioxidant and Antiglycation Activities of Three Phenolic-Rich Indian Red Rice Genotypes and In Silico Evaluation of Their Phenolic Metabolites"
"Anosmia is a frequently experienced symptom in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous studies have suggested the potential use of olfactometry to identify infected individuals. We performed a sequential olfactometry using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) in a COVID-19 patient without pneumonia. The test uses 12 odorants that are familiar to the Japanese population. Our patient was a 56-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 who was admitted to our hospital following the development of anosmia. He had no respiratory symptoms except pharyngeal pain. Chest CT findings did not reveal the presence of pneumonia. The patient underwent OSIT-J on the 1st hospital day, and his score was 1 out of 12. Following the olfactometry, ciclesonide was administered. The patient did not develop any new symptoms during hospitalization, and his anosmia was gradually improved. The OSIT-J scores were 9 and 11 on the 7th and 16th hospital day, respectively. The patient was discharged on the 25th hospital day after two negative PCR test results. In our case, OSIT-J could identify anosmia in a COVID-19 patient. Some COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic, expect for olfactory disturbances, and OSIT-J may help identify such patients in the Japanese population.",[The odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) in a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without pneumonia]
"It is well known that many viruses use heparan sulfate as the initial attachment factor. In the present study, we determined whether porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an emerging veterinary virus, infects Vero cells by attaching to heparan sulfate. Western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and plaque formation assay revealed that PEDV infection was inhibited when the virus was pretreated with heparin (an analogue of heparan sulfate). There was no inhibitory effect when the cells were pre-incubated with heparin. We next demonstrated that enzymatic removal of the highly sulfated domain of heparan sulfate by heparinase I treatment inhibited PEDV infection. We also confirmed that sodium chlorate, which interferes with heparan sulfate biosynthesis, also inhibited PEDV infection. Furthermore, we examined the effect of two heparin derivatives with different types of sulfation on PEDV infection. The data suggested de-N-sulfated heparin, but not N-acetyl-de-O-sulfated heparin, inhibits PEDV infection. In summary, our studies revealed that heparan sulfate acts as the attachment factor of PEDV in Vero cells.",Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus uses cell-surface heparan sulfate as an attachment factor.
"Objectives: New or increased cough is an important sign of pulmonary exacerbation. There is unmet need to objectively quantify and analyse cough trends in early life. Advances in flexible electronics and materials allow development of soft, skin-like, accelerometer-based wearable devices that seamlessly interface with the human body in unique locations, enabling the simultaneous capture of low-frequency body, chest, and throat motion along with high-frequency vocal, throat, and lung sound signals associated with various body processes including coughs and vital signs. Methods: A small, flexible, fully wireless, accelerometer-based mechano-acoustic sensor (MAS) was applied using gentle adhesives to the suprasternal notch of 10 paediatric CF subjects during regular clinic visits. A 15-minute protocol consisting of eliciting cough, throat clearing, speech, and laughs in various head/body orientations, ambient environments, and physical activity intensities. The MAS recorded at a high bandwidth 1.6kHz rate and automatically uploaded to a cloud server upon replacement on a wireless charging platform. Results: The captured sensor data was analysed using an existing machine learning algorithm developed for COVID-19 symptom tracking. Preliminary results show the device differentiates cough from other vocal, respiratory noises and motion artifacts, both at rest and during activity. A majority of children found the device to be acceptable, though device size and adhesive removal caused minor discomfort for some. Conclusion: The extraction of well-classified cough events is feasible, facilitating further analysis of cough episode duration, force, and clinically relevant features associated with early decompensation, response to treatment, and daily symptom tracking. Objective measurement of cough may be useful as a clinical study outcome measure and for clinical monitoring. Future work will include evaluation for longer time periods during stability and pulmonary exacerbations.","A soft, flexible, wearable device for cough detection in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients"
"BACKGROUND Prognosis models based on stepwise regression methods show modest performance in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). Automated variable selection allows data-driven risk evaluation by recognizing distinct patterns in data. We sought to evaluate an automated variable selection method (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, LASSO) for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and CS (AMICS) receiving acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to two established scores. METHODS AND RESULTS Consecutive patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI at one of two tertiary heart centres in Denmark 2010-2017. Patients were divided according to treatment with mechanical circulatory support (MCS); PCI-MCS cohort (n = 220) versus PCI cohort (n = 1180). The latter was divided into a development (2010-2014) and a temporal validation cohort (2015-2017). Cohort-specific LASSO models were based on data obtained before PCI. LASSO models outperformed IABP-SHOCK II and CardShock risk scores in discriminative ability for 30-day mortality in the PCI validation [receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84) vs 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75), respectively, P < 0.01 for both] and PCI-MCS development cohort [ROC AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.83) vs 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71), respectively, P < 0.01 for both]. Variable influence differed depending on MCS, with age being the most influential factor in the LASSO-PCI model, whereas haematocrit and estimated glomerular filtration rate were the highest-ranking factors in the LASSO-PCI-MCS model. CONCLUSION Data-driven prognosis models outperformed established risk scores in patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI and exhibited good discriminative abilities. Observations indicate a potential use of machinelearning to facilitate individualized patient care and targeted interventions in the future.",Data-driven point-of-care risk model in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.
"(1) Background: RNA viruses and especially coronaviruses could act inside host cells not only by building their own proteins, but also by perturbing the cell metabolism. We show the possibility of miRNA-like inhibitions by the SARS-CoV-2 concerning for example the hemoglobin and type I interferons syntheses, hence highly perturbing oxygen distribution in vital organs and immune response as described by clinicians; (2) Hypothesis: We hypothesize that short RNA sequences (about 20 nucleotides in length) from the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome can inhibit the translation of human proteins involved in oxygen metabolism, olfactory perception and immune system. (3) Methods: We compare RNA subsequences of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes to mRNA sequences of beta-globin and type I interferons; (4) Results: RNA subsequences longer than eight nucleotides from SARS-CoV-2 genome could hybridize subsequences of the mRNA of beta-globin and of type I interferons; (5) Conclusions: Beyond viral protein production, COVID-19 might affect vital processes like host oxygen transport and immune response.",SARS-CoV-2 and miRNA-like inhibition power
"OBJECTIVE: The development and the evaluation of the Healthy Meals web app designed for professionals from different disciplines related to food, aimed to assess the nutritional and food allergen content of restaurant meals, was described. METHODS: App evaluation concerned: (1) usability, scored on a 7-point scale by 6 restaurateurs and 10 nutritionists through the Computer System Usability Questionnaire; (2) quality, scored on a 5-point scale by 10 nutritionists through the Mobile App Rating Scale; (3) validation, by two nutritionists through differences in entered nutrient contents. Ratings reliability was assessed by the interclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Users agreed with the web app usability (mean 5.6/7 points, SD 0.9), with moderate reliability among ratings (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.82). The web app showed good objective quality (mean 4.0/5 points, SD 0.4), with excellent reliability among nutritionists (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.96). For web app validation, no significant differences were observed between the two nutritionists’ data, with excellent reliability (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99). App data entry was identified as a point to improve. CONCLUSIONS: The Healthy Meals web app designed for professionals related to food, such as restaurateurs, demonstrated to be usable, of good quality and valid for dishes nutritional assessment and food allergen identification.

"Present hopes to conquer the Covid-19 epidemic are largely based on the expectation of a rapid availability of vaccines. However, once vaccine production starts, it will probably take time before there is enough vaccine for everyone, evoking the question how to distribute it best. While present vaccination guidelines largely focus on individual-based factors, i.e. on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first, e.g. to risk groups or to individuals with a strong social-mixing tendency, here we ask if a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, e.g. to prioritize certain cities, can help to increase the overall survival rate of a population subject to an epidemic disease. To this end, we propose a strategy for the distribution of vaccines in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with the most new cases of infection during a certain time frame and compare it with the standard practice of distributing vaccines demographically. Using a simple statistical model we find that, for a locally well-mixed population, the proposed strategy strongly reduces the number of deaths (by about a factor of two for basic reproduction numbers of [Formula: see text] and by about 35% for [Formula: see text] ). The proposed vaccine distribution strategy establishes the idea that prioritizing individuals not only regarding individual factors, such as their risk of spreading the disease, but also according to the region in which they live can help saving lives. The suggested vaccine distribution strategy can be tested in more detailed models in the future and might inspire discussions regarding the importance of spatiotemporal distribution rules for vaccination guidelines.",Strategic spatiotemporal vaccine distribution increases the survival rate in an infectious disease like Covid-19
"Cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries. Thousands of health workers have been infected and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities and prisons. World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whilst the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended airborne precautions. The 1 – 2 m (≈3 – 6 ft) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes large droplets do not travel further than 2 m (≈6 ft). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance travelled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), US Center for Diseases Control (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 – 2 m (≈3 – 6 ft) rule of spatial separation. Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m (≈6 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters (≈26 ft). Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 support aerosol transmission and one study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (≈13 ft) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, 3 hours after aeroslisation. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.",Airborne or droplet precautions for health workers treating COVID-19?
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is generally diagnosed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or serological assays. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreases a few days after symptom onset. Thus, the RT-PCR sensitivity peaks at three days after symptom onset (approximately 80%). We evaluated the performance of the ARCHITECTR SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (henceforth termed IgG assay;Abbott Laboratories, Lake County, IL, USA), and the combination of RT-PCR and the IgG assay for COVID-19 diagnosis.",Combination of a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and RT-PCR for improved COVID-19 diagnosis
"Summary Neighbour-Joining is one of the most widely used distance-based phylogenetic inference methods. However, current implementations do not scale well for datasets with more than 10,000 sequences. Given the increasing pace of generating new sequence data, particularly in outbreaks of emerging diseases, and the already enormous existing databases of sequence data for which NJ is a useful approach, new implementations of existing methods are warranted. Here we present DecentTree, which provides highly optimised and parallel implementations of Neighbour-Joining and several of its variants. DecentTree is designed as a stand-alone application and a header-only library easily integrated with other phylogenetic software (e.g. it is integral in the popular IQ-TREE software). We show that DecentTree shows similar or improved performance over existing software (BIONJ, Quicktree, FastME, and RapidNJ), especially for handling very large alignments. For example, DecentTree is up to 6-fold faster than the fastest existing Neighbour-Joining software (e.g. RapidNJ) when generating a tree of 64,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

"Hemobilia which is firstly described in 1948 is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Since its main clinic takes time to occur and may cause mortality, early diagnosis and management have a great importance. Almost for 3 years, the world has been facing with an unknown viral infection called COVID-19 whose clinic changes from asymptomatic respiratory infection to symptoms associated with multiple system involvement. The clinical presentation of Covid-19 infection varies tremendously depending on the severity of the illness. In this report, we present the first two cases of severe COVID-19 induced hemobilia.",COVID-19 induced haemobilia: a novel entity
"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Viral Respiratory illnesses such as Covid-19 and Influenza pose significant health challenges worldwide. There are more than 150M confirmed cases of Covid-19 with a reported 3.15M deaths (as of April, 2021). The WHO reports there to be ~ 1 billion influenza cases and 290-650K influenza-associated deaths annually. A signature feature of these illnesses is an early infection period that, if insufficiently recognized and controlled early, can lead to viral spread and avoidable morbidity/mortality. The need for personalized, remote care tools that facilitate early detection and triage of viral illness has never been greater. To address this gap, we developed an institutional software, Vironix, that uses machine-learned (ML) prediction models to enable real-time risk stratification and decision support for global organizations. METHODS: ML models were trained on clinical characteristic data from East and South Asia, Western Europe, and USA. Algorithms take an input of symptom, profile, biometric, and exposure data and return an assessment of disease severity. Covid-19 algorithms were validated on computer generated patient vigenttes and deployed in the Vironix web app among 22 participants in a small business commercial pilot for member self-screening. Members conducted daily health assessments and received personalized decision support while organization managers received work-from-home recommendations and compliant symptom monitoring without seeing member health data. For influenza, Vironix ML algorithms were tested on a dataset (with a 90/10 train test split) collected from one academic and two community emergency rooms from March 2014 to July 2017 (Hong et al.). RESULTS: ML-predictions showed 87.6% accuracy, 85.5% sensitivity, and 87.8% specificity in identifying severe Covid-19 presentations in an out-of-sample validation set of 5,000 patient cases. After 4-months pilot use, Vironix issued 14 stay-at-home and 10 healthcare escalation recommendations while maintaining 30-day and 7-day user retention of 66% and 72%, greatly exceeding common app adoption rates. ML predictions for the Influenza data set showed 67.8% accuracy, 71.7% sensitivity, and 65.4% specificity in identifying admissible or dischargeable presentations of influenza in an out-of-sample validation set of 56,000 patient cases. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 ML-severity assessments showed strong accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying severe clinical presentations. The deployed web-app showed high adoption with members receiving relevant decision support. Flu algorithm performance could be bolstered by inclusion of biometric features. Additional controlled trials could be conducted to establish validated markers of health improvement and early illness detection resulting from Vironix use. The overall methodology for mapping clinical characteristic data into patient scenarios for training ML classifiers of health deterioration is generalizable for a variety of potential software and hardware deployments across disease spaces. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The technology detailed in this study represents a potential low cost, scalable, hardware/software agnostic, global solution for early detection and intervention on infectious respiratory illness. These solutions can be integrated into remote care and institutional wellness workflows to support public health initiatives.

"Neutralizing antibodies represent a valuable therapeutic approach to countermeasure the current COVID-19 pandemic. Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants emphasizes the notion that antibody treatments need to rely on highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), targeting several distinct epitopes for circumventing therapy escape-mutants. Previously, we reported efficient human therapeutic mAbs recognizing epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the isolation, characterization and recombinant production of 12 neutralizing human mAbs, targeting three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of the virus. Neutralization mechanism of these antibodies involves receptors other than the canonical hACE2 on target cells, relying both on amino-acid and N-glycan epitope-recognition, suggesting alternative viral cellular-portals. Two selected mAbs demonstrated full protection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice when administered at low doses and late post-exposure, demonstrating the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Therapeutic antibodies, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike N-terminal domain, protect lethally infected K18-hACE2 mice"
"The purpose of this clinical case report is to describe a case of mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA), or Morquio syndrome, with increased choroidal thickness in enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) which can represent choroidal deposition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). A 21-year-old male with genetically confirmed diagnosis of MPS IVA was examined at our Pediatric Ophthalmology clinic as part of our follow-up protocol for MPS patients. His best-corrected visual acuity was 4/10 in his right eye (OD) and 6/10 in the left eye (OS). Mild diffuse corneal opacification was evident. Intraocular pressure was within normal range. Fundus examination and color fundus photography revealed no abnormalities. EDI-OCT revealed significantly increased choroidal thickness in his right eye and in his left eye, suggesting the presence of choroidal deposition of GAGs, despite absence of retinal or optic disc GAG deposition or other chorioretinal involvement. To our knowledge, this is the first case of MPS IVA described in the literature with suspected choroidal deposition of GAGs. With improved control of systemic features of MPS IVA, life expectancy of these patients has increased, allowing for more ocular manifestations to develop. The parallel development of technology in ophthalmology, such as the EDI-OCT, further contributes to the detection of these unprecedented ocular features in MPSs.",Increased Choroidal Thickness in Morquio Syndrome
"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health disaster. Moreover, emerging mutated virus strains present an even greater challenge for existing vaccines and medications. One possible solution is to design drugs based on the properties of virus epigenome, which are more common among coronaviruses. Here, we reported an FDA-approved drug for myelodysplastic syndrome, azacytidine (5Aza), limited virus infection and protected mice against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that this antiviral effect is related to 5Aza incorporation into viral RNA, which disrupt m5C RNA methylation modification profile. This work suggests that targeting viral epigenomes is a viable therapeutic strategy, potentially opening new pathways for treating COVID-19.",Azacytidine targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA as a potential treatment for COVID-19
"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has emerged as a technique that uses a natural scar, the umbilicus, within which a multiple-entry portal is placed into a 3.0-4.0-cm single incision to perform operations. The objective of this study was to compare incision size, wound complications, and postoperative pain of LESS compared with those of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted between January and June 2011 at two university hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic or LESS cholecystectomy. Skin and aponeurosis wound sizes were recorded. A 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain at postoperative hours 3 and 24. Healing and wound complications were assessed at follow-up. RESULTS A total of 57 patients, 53 women and 4 men with a mean age of 48.7 years, were randomly assigned to undergo LESS (n = 28) or LC (n = 29). The mean length of the umbilical skin incision was 4.0 cm (range = 2.1-5.8) in LESS and 2.7 cm (1.5-5.1) in LC (p < .0001). The mean internal aponeurosis diameter was 3.5 cm (2.0-5.5) in LESS and 2.3 cm (1.2-3.5) in LC (p < .0001). The mean operative time was 60.3 min (32-128) for LESS and 51.3 min (25-120) for LC (p = 0.11). Gallbladder perforation at detachment occurred in 15.69 % of the LESS cases and in 5.88 % of the LC cases (p = 0.028). The mean VAS score for pain at hour 3 was 2.0 points (0-7) for the LESS group and 4.0 (0-10) for the LC group (p = 0.07), and at postoperative hour 24 it was 0.3 points (0-6) for LESS and 2.3 (0-10) for LC (p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in wound complications. Incisional hernias were not found in either group. CONCLUSIONS The LESS single-port (SP) operations demand a bigger incision than LC surgery. However, there were no differences in healing, wound infections, and hernia development. We found a tendency of less postoperative pain associated with LESS/SP than with LC.",Randomized clinical study for assessment of incision characteristics and pain associated with LESS versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

"The recent lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions in Switzerland causes uncertainty about the future of the epidemic. We developed a compartmental model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland and projected the course of the epidemic until the end of year 2020 under various scenarios. The model was age-structured with three categories: children (0-17), adults (18-64) and seniors (65- years). Lifting all restrictions according to the plans disclosed by the Swiss federal authorities by mid-May resulted in a rapid rebound in the epidemic, with the peak expected in July. Measures equivalent to at least 76% reduction in all contacts were able to eradicate the epidemic; a 54% reduction in contacts could keep the intensive care unit occupancy under the critical level and delay the next wave until October. In scenarios where strong contact reductions were only applied in selected age groups, the epidemic could not be suppressed, resulting in an increased risk of a rebound in July, and another stronger wave in September. Future interventions need to cover all age groups to keep the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic under control.",Future scenarios for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland: an age-structured model.

This article summarizes a European Biological Rhythms Society (EBRS) workshop held in July 2020 to review current knowledge of the interplay between the circadian clock and viral infections to inform therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. A large body of work supports the role of the circadian clock in regulating various aspects of viral replication, host responses, and associated pathogenesis. We review the evidence describing the multifaceted role of the circadian clock, spanning host susceptibility, antiviral mechanisms, and host resilience. Finally, we define the most pressing research questions and how our knowledge of chronobiology can inform key translational research priorities.","Clocks, Viruses, and Immunity: Lessons for the COVID-19 Pandemic"
"The present ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is creating havoc across the world. The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii) realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix) incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis;but to compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In the framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant success of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the population and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very grave situation.",A kinetic model for qualitative understanding and analysis of the effect of complete lockdown imposed by India for controlling the COVID-19 disease spread by the SARS-CoV-2 virus
"Food gardens are an underdeveloped resource for teaching and research in Australian universities. While some campuses have food or botanical gardens, outside the biological or physical sciences food growing is not routinely incorporated into mainstream curricula. This article investigates why and how we might change this. It examines universities’ traditional reliance on classroom-based, non-experiential learning, which preferences reading and writing over doing, particularly doing anything outdoors. Questions are raised about the implications of this approach for environmental education and graduate environmental literacy. The article then explores the example that United States campus food gardens provide other universities, as well as the process of creating food gardens for teaching and research at a high-density campus in Sydney, Australia. The article ends by postulating lessons students and staff might learn about food systems, sustainability and green cities, when food growing is incorporated into teaching and research.

"Relational Agents (RAs) may be helpful in supporting the social distancing mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing essential health services to patients at home and eliminating the need for in-person hospital visits. We conceptualized and developed a prototypical RA to visualize how this can be done in four major COVID-19 related health scenarios. In this paper, we present acceptance evaluation of the proposed RA using a survey based approach. A total of 105 participants were asked to interact with and analyze the prototype. Participants then indicated perceived usefulness and willingness to accept and use the proposed RA on Likert scales. The findings show that overall 80.77% of participants found the suggested RA useful. 59.67% of participants accepted it as an alternative to healthcare professionals as long as the scenario is not life-threatening. Furthermore, 78.29% of the participants indicated that they would be willing to use the proposed RA, if needed.

"The category of “epidemic diseases” is discussed extensively in the literature of traditional Chinese medicine, however it is often overlooked in modern Chinese medicine education precisely because population-level prevention and treatment do not fit easily into the dogma that individualized herbal formulas “based on patterns identified” is the primary mode of clinical reasoning in Chinese medicine. In the recent COVID-19 epidemic, the contingencies of treating large numbers of patients meant that it was not possible to provide “one prescription for each patient.” In fact, four categories of patients were sometimes given the same formula: mild and moderate confirmed cases, close contacts of confirmed cases, and suspected cases. The lines between prevention and treatment, along with clear demarcations between individual and population-level immunity, were blurred in the mist of the urgent imperative to provide what could reasonably be expected to be effective. Lessons from the large-scale participation of Chinese medicine in the COVID-19 public health crisis are relevant for the global community of Chinese medicine practitioners and may provide insights into how future epidemics could be addressed in the absence of effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals.",Preventing COVID-19 with Chinese Medicine: Concepts and Suggestions
"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, New York instituted a statewide stay-at-home mandate to lower viral transmission. While public health guidelines advised continued provision of timely care for patients, disruption of safety-net health care and public fear have been proposed to be related to indirect deaths because of delays in presentation. We hypothesized that admissions for emergency general surgery (EGS) diagnoses would decrease during the pandemic and that mortality for these patients would increase. METHODS: A multicenter observational study comparing EGS admissions from January to May 2020 to 2018 and 2019 across 11 NYC hospitals in the largest public health care system in the United States was performed. Emergency general surgery diagnoses were defined using International Classification Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and grouped into seven common diagnosis categories: appendicitis, cholecystitis, small/large bowel, peptic ulcer disease, groin hernia, ventral hernia, and necrotizing soft tissue infection. Baseline demographics were compared including age, race/ethnicity, and payor status. Outcomes included coronavirus disease (COVID) status and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,376 patients were admitted for EGS diagnoses from January to May 2020, a decrease compared with both 2018 (1,789) and 2019 (1,668) (p < 0.0001). This drop was most notable after the stay-at-home mandate (March 22, 2020; week 12). From March to May 2020, 3.3%, 19.2%, and 6.0% of EGS admissions were incidentally COVID positive, respectively. Mortality increased in March to May 2020 compared with 2019 (2.2% vs. 0.7%); this difference was statistically significant between April 2020 and April 2019 (4.1% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Supporting our hypothesis, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home mandate resulted in decreased EGS admissions between March and May 2020 compared with prior years. During this time, there was also a statistically significant increase in mortality, which peaked at the height of COVID infection rates in our population.

"INTRODUCTION: Despite the high incidence of respiratory depression on the general care floor and evidence that continuous monitoring improves patient outcomes, the cost–benefit of continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring of general care floor patients remains unknown. This study modeled the cost and length of stay savings, investment break-even point, and likelihood of cost savings for continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring of general care floor patients at risk for respiratory depression. METHODS: A decision tree model was created to compare intermittent pulse oximetry versus continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring. The model utilized costs and outcomes from the PRediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) trial, and was applied to a modeled cohort of 2447 patients receiving opioids per median-sized United States general care floor annually. RESULTS: Continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring of high-risk patients is projected to reduce annual hospital cost by $535,531 and cumulative patient length of stay by 103 days. A 1.5% reduction in respiratory depression would achieve a break-even investment point and justify the investment cost. The probability of cost saving is ≥ 80% if respiratory depression is decreased by ≥ 17%. Expansion of continuous monitoring to high- and intermediate-risk patients, or to all patients, is projected to reach a break-even point when respiratory depression is reduced by 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively, with a ≥ 80% probability of cost savings when respiratory depression decreases by ≥ 27% and ≥ 31%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared to intermittent pulse oximetry, continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring of general care floor patients receiving opioids has a high chance of being cost-effective.

"Aim: Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have increased risk of developing vascular complications due to chronic hyperglycemia. Glycemic variability (GV) has been suggested to play an even more important role in the risk of developing diabetic complications than sustained hyperglycemia. Physical activity (PA) has shown reducing effects on mean plasma glucose; however, the effect on GV in T2DM needs further description. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effect of PA on GV, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with T2DM. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on MEDLINE and Embase to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) covering the aspects T2DM, PA, and CGM. Following eligibility screening, variables of population characteristics, PA interventions, and GV outcomes were extracted and processed through qualitative synthesis. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using Cochrane ROB tool v2.0. Results: Of 1,825 identified articles, 40 full texts were screened. In the ten included RCTs matching the eligibility criteria, sample sizes ranged from nine to 63, mean age from 51 (SD 11) to 65 (SD 2) years and mean T2DM duration from four (SD 3) to ten (SD 6) years. Eight RCTs examined GV following single bouts of exercise, while two RCTs examined GV following training interventions. One RCT applied parallel group design, while nine RCTs applied crossover design. Numeric reductions in GV following acute exercise were seen, with four RCTs reaching statistical significance. Numeric reductions in GV were seen following training interventions, with one RCT reaching statistical significance. Numeric reductions of GV after PA appeared independently of intensity and T2DM progression but higher in participants with high baseline HbA1c and GV than with low. 80% of the trials were evaluated as uncertain/high ROB. Conclusion: The systematic literature search revealed limited and biased evidence showing that acute PA numerically reduced GV in patients with T2DM. PA reduced GV independently of PA intensity and T2DM progression. Prolonged RCTs with low ROB are needed to confirm reducing effects of PA on GV and to assess the influence of patient- and intervention characteristics on the effect of PA on GV.",The Impact of Physical Activity on Glycemic Variability Assessed by Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.
"BACKGROUND Coxsackievirus A16 (Cox A16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) are common pathogens causing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in pediatric population. Little is known about the basic reproductive number (R0) for these enteroviruses. METHODS We estimated the R0 of EV71 and of Cox A16 from laboratory-confirmed HFMD outbreaks reported to the Department of Health, from 2004 to 2009. We derived a mathematical model and calculated R₀ based on the cumulative number of cases at the initial growth phase of the outbreaks, as determined by the epidemic curves. We tested the association of R₀ with settings and sizes of the institution and total number of persons affected. RESULTS We analyzed 34 outbreaks, 27 caused by Cox A16 and 7 caused by EV71. Assuming the incubation period to be 5 days, the median R₀ of EV71 was 5.48 with an interquartile range of 4.20 to 6.51, whereas the median R₀ of Cox A16 was 2.50 with an interquartile range of 1.96 to 3.67. The R₀ of EV71 was significantly higher than that of CoxA16, P = 0.002; and sensitivity analysis showed the same results. The R₀ was not associated with outbreak settings, sizes of the institutions, or number of persons affected. CONCLUSIONS The R₀ for EV71 and for Cox A16 was determined using a model which showed that the R₀ for EV71 was higher than that of Cox A16. This finding helps better understand the transmission dynamics of HFMD outbreaks and formulate public health measures for controlling the disease.","Estimation of the basic reproduction number of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 in hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks."
"SARS-CoV-2, which initially emerged in November of 2019, wreaked havoc across the globe by leading to clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome and continues to evade current therapies today due to mutating strains. Diabetes mellitus is considered an important risk factor for progression to severe COVID disease and death, therefore additional research is warranted in this group. Individuals with diabetes at baseline have an underlying inflammatory state with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, both of which cause these individuals to have higher susceptibility to SARS- CoV2 infection. The detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to its ability to induce a vast cell mediated immune response leading to a surge in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This paper will be exploring the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology in individuals with diabetes and insulin resistance making them more prone to have worse outcomes after SARS- CoV2 infection, and to propose an adjunctive therapy to help combat the cytokine surge seen in COVID-19. It will also look at the immunomodulatory effects of glutathione, an antioxidant shown to reduce immune dysregulation in other diseases; Vitamin D, which has been shown to prevent COVID-19 patients from requiring more intensive care time possibly due to its ability to decrease the expression of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines; and steroids, which have been used as immune modulators despite their ability to exacerbate hyperglycemia.",Type 2 Diabetes Contributes to Altered Adaptive Immune Responses and Vascular Inflammation in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection
"Blockchain is a novel data architecture characterized by a chronological sequence of blocks in a decentralized manner. We aimed to evaluate the real‐world feasibility of a blockchain‐based dynamic consent platform (METORY) in a decentralized and multicenter trial. The study consisted of three visits (i.e., screening and 2 follow‐up visits) with a 2‐week interval. Each subject was required to report the self‐measured body temperatures and take a virtual investigational drug by entering the unique drug code on the application. To simulate real‐world study settings, two major (i.e., changes in the schedule of body temperature measurement) and three minor protocol amendments (i.e., nonsignificant changes without any changes in the procedures) were set. Overall study completion rates, proportion of consent, and response time to each protocol amendment and adherence were evaluated. A total of 60 subjects (30 in each center) were enrolled in two study centers. All subjects completed the study, and the overall proportion of consent to each protocol amendment was 95.7 ± 13.7% (mean ± SD), with a median response time of 0.2 h. Overall, subjects took 90.8% ± 19.2% of the total drug, whereas compliance with the schedule was 69.1% ± 27.0%. Subjects reported 96.7% ± 4.2% of the total body temperature measurements whereas the adherence to the schedule was 59.0% ± 25.0%, which remarkably decreased after major protocol amendments. In conclusion, we evaluated a blockchain‐based dynamic consent platform in real clinical trial settings. The results suggested that major changes should be avoided unless subjects’ proper understanding is warranted.",Evaluation of a blockchain‐based dynamic consent platform (METORY) in a decentralized and multicenter clinical trial using virtual drugs
"Artemisia and its allied species have been employed for conventional medicine in the Northern temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia for the treatments of digestive problems, morning sickness, irregular menstrual cycle, typhoid, epilepsy, renal problems, bronchitis malaria, etc. The multidisciplinary use of artemisia species has various other health benefits that are related to its traditional and modern pharmaceutical perspectives. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the traditional, modern, biological as well as pharmacological use of the essential oil and herbal extracts of Artemisia nilagirica, Artemisia parviflora, and other allied species of Artemisia. It also discusses the botanical circulation and its phytochemical constituents viz disaccharides, polysaccharides, glycosides, saponins, terpenoids, flavonoids, and carotenoids. The plants have different biological importance like antiparasitic, antimalarial, antihyperlipidemic, antiasthmatic, antiepileptic, antitubercular, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antidepressant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, insecticidal, antiviral activities, and also against COVID-19. Toxicological studies showed that the plants at a low dose and short duration are non or low-toxic. In contrast, a high dose at 3 g/kg and for a longer duration can cause toxicity like rapid respiration, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, etc. However, further in-depth studies are needed to determine the medicinal uses, clinical efficacy and safety are crucial next steps.",Phytochemistry and pharmacological activity of the genus artemisia
"The study of hospital wastewater (HWW) microbiology is important to understand the pollution load, growth of particular pathogenic microbes, shift and drift in microbial community, development and spread of antibiotic resistance in microbes, and subsequent change in treatment efficiencies. This chapter investigates the potential microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites present in HWW along with the diseases associated and methods of treatment used. Due to the indiscriminate release of antibiotics from hospitals, HWW serves as a hotspot for emergence of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistance bacteria. This chapter discusses the ARGs occurrence in HWW, their prevalence in the environment, the molecular tools used for identification, and different mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer. Thus better understanding of the microbiology of HWW could further help in development of advanced treatment technologies for effective removal of microbes and their bioproducts (toxins and infectious nucleic acid) from HWW and contaminated water.",Microbiology of hospital wastewater
"We analyzed the plasma levels of interferons and cytokines, and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. Mild patients exhibited transient type I interferon responses, while ICU patients had prolonged type I interferon responses with hyper-inflammation mediated by interferon regulatory factor 1. Type II interferon responses were compromised in ICU patients. Type III interferon responses were induced in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in convalescent patients. These results highlight the importance of type I and III interferon responses during the early phase of infection in controlling COVID-19 progression.","Type I, II, and III interferon signatures correspond to COVID-19 disease severity"
"COVID-19 is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) which was identified on 7 January 2020 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the throat swab sample of a patient. This novel coronavirus is phylogenetically similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused SARS outbreak in 2002.Objective: To describe a case of a COVID-19 patient in a hospital in Indonesia.Case Report: A 55-year-old male was admitted to the Emergency Department of Arifin Achmad Hospital on 31 March 2020. He was transferred from a private hospital after three days of hospitalization. Previously, he came to another hospital complaining palpitation, cough, having difficulty of breathing, and intermittent fever. He then was advised to be admitted and tested for a COVID-19 test. At first, he did not admit to having traveled recently. After three days, the pharyngeal swab test was received confirming that he was contracted with COVID-19. The patient was then transferred to our hospital and hospitalized for ten days.Discussion: The patient was fully recovered after ten days of treatment with antiviral drug namely Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day and chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice a day orally. The combination of both drugs showed an immune-modulating activity which might increase its antiviral effects. Therefore, the use of this agent in COVID-19 patients might be worthwhile. During hospitalization, reducing patient anxiety was also one of our main goals as many studies has found that anxiety is associated with poor immune system.Conclusion: This case report demonstrated the current situation in Indonesia where people become reluctant to fully disclose their symptoms or travel history to the health care workers, which may put many others on the risk of being transmitted with the virus. Although the proven efficacy of chloroquine is still lacking, it has become the favorable choice at this moment as indicated in our study. Reducing the patient?s anxiety towards the disease may help to speed the patient?s recovery. Also, we need to educate public that COVID-19 might be a life-threatening disease but it is also a treatable disease.",The Role Of Chloroquine And Psychosocial Support In A Patient With COVID-19: A Case Report In Indonesia
"While the early Christian Church demonstrates a deep desire to relieve physical suffering, the Greco-Roman world in which it developed lacked the same impetus to respond to human need, especially in the context of epidemic or communicable disease. Christianity's dedication to health care, and its belief that assisting the sick constituted an absolute obligation, distinguished early Christianity from its contemporary cultural milieu which regularly ignored and excluded the sick. The novelty of the Christian approach to healing can be traced to the early church's unique recognition of human need. This vision of human need, which ultimately replaced the secular Greco-Roman emphasis on reciprocal philanthropy and providing assistance only to the worthy, is clearly exemplified in the life of Christ, in responses to plague and in the writings of John Chrysostom and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus. An analysis of these sources demonstrates that the early Christian Church viewed the sick not only as persons to be assisted insofar as they shared a common human nature but also individuals necessary for the salvation of the broader community as a whole. The early church's emphasis on reciprocal interdependence between healthy and sick eliminated the boundaries traditionally established between these two groups and transformed long-standing notions of contagious disease. Ultimately, the development of these attitudes toward the sick originates in a deeper truth which underlies the Christian healthcare tradition both in the ancient world and in the modern era: humanity's profound and mutual need of God, before whom all are spiritually ill.","Awaking to Mutual, Reciprocal Need in Plague and Epidemic Disease: The Origins of Early Christian Health Care."
"Background: Overparenting is an emerging parenting style in which parents over-protect their children from difficulties and challenges by intruding into their lives and providing extensive assistance to them. Unfortunately, longitudinal studies related to overparenting were severely lacking, particularly on its impacts on early adolescents. Moreover, studies examining the mediational pathways through which overparenting is associated with adolescent anxiety are scant. This study examined the mediating role of parent-child conflict (father-child and mother-child) in the relationship between overparenting (paternal and maternal) and adolescent anxiety over time. Method: Based on a three-wave longitudinal data of 1074 Chinese early adolescents in Hong Kong, the relationships among paternal and maternal overparenting, father- and mother-child conflict, and adolescent anxiety were assessed. Results: Mother-child conflict mediated the relationship between maternal overparenting and adolescent anxiety over time. Besides, a reverse association of prior adolescent anxiety with subsequent maternal overparenting via mother-child conflict was also identified. In addition, adolescent gender and family intactness did not moderate the relationships among overparenting, parent-child conflict, and adolescent anxiety. Discussion: This present study identified that the bidirectional relationship between maternal overparenting and adolescent anxiety via mother-child conflict over time, which sheds new light on the study of overparenting on adolescent well-being in the Chinese communities.","Overparenting, Parent-Child Conflict and Anxiety among Chinese Adolescents: A Cross-Lagged Panel Study"
"The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) provide science-based recommendations for healthy dietary patterns to promote health and reduce risk of chronic diseases. Yet, since their inception in 1980 and updates every 5 y, Americans fall short of meeting dietary recommendations and diet-related chronic diseases continue to be a public health concern. In May of 2021, the Institute of Food Technologists and the Department of Food Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, convened a diverse group of thought leaders in health, nutrition, and food science to identify opportunities and approaches to improve consumer adoption of the DGA recommendations. The invited leaders collaborated in roundtable discussions to develop recommendations and strategies to promote adoption of the DGA recommendations after hearing sessions on the latest consumer trends, advances in food science and technology, and effective communications approaches. Participants agreed that changes in consumer behaviors and heightened interest in health due to the novel coronavirus pandemic have created an opportune time to engage consumers about healthy eating. Communications must be simple, tailored to the consumer, and delivered by influencer(s)/spokesperson(s) who are credible sources and share personal values. Innovations in food science and technology have enabled improvements in the safety, health, acceptability, affordability, and availability of foods, but opportunities to provide more options to enhance consumption of desired food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, remain. Moving Americans toward healthier dietary patterns aligned with DGA recommendations will require collaborations within the food sector and beyond to achieve broad-scale amplification and investment. Thought leaders in health, nutrition, and food science identified opportunities to improve consumer adoption of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 through better communication, collaboration, and innovation.",Implementing the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Recommendations for a Path Forward
"The energetics of the stepwise dissociation of a A:B2 bi-component crystal, according to A:B2(cr) â A:B(cr) + B(cr) and A:B(cr) â A(cr) + B(cr), was investigated using MA:Phe2 and MA:Phe (MA = maleic acid; Phe = L-phenylalanine) as model systems. The enthalpy changes associated with these sequential processes and with the overall dissociation reaction A:B2(cr) â A(cr) + 2B(cr) were determined by solution calorimetry. It was found that they are all positive, indicating that there is a lattice enthalpy gain when MA:Phe2 is formed, either from the individual precursors or by adding Phe to MA:Phe. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis showed that MA:Phe2 is best described as a protic salt containing a maleate anion (MA-) and two non-equivalent L-phenylalanine units, both linked to MA- by NH···O hydrogen bonds (H-bond): one of these units is protonated (HPhe+) and the other zwitterionic (Phe±). Only MA- and HPhe+ molecules are present in the MA:Phe lattice. In this case, however, NH···O and OH···O H-bonds are formed between each MA- unit and two HPhe+ molecules. Despite these structural differences, the enthalpy cost for the removal of the zwitterionic Phe± unit from the MA:Phe2 lattice to yield MA:Phe is only 0.9 ± 0.4 kJ mol-1 higher than that for the dissociation of MA:Phe, which requires a proton transfer from HPhe+ to MA- and the rearrangement of L-phenylalanine to the zwitterionic, Phe±, form. Finally, a comparison of the dissociation energetics and structures of MA:Phe and of the previously reported glycine maleate (MA:Gly) analogue indicated that parameters, such as the packing coefficient, density, hydrogen bonds formed, or fusion temperature, are not necessarily good descriptors of dissociation enthalpy or lattice enthalpy trends when bi-component crystals with different molecular composition are being compared, even if the stoichiometry is the same.",First and Second Dissociation Enthalpies in Bi-Component Crystals Consisting of Maleic Acid and L-Phenylalanine
"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a great number of papers have been published in the pediatric field. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess research around the globe on COVID-19 in the pediatric field by bibliometric analysis, identifying publication trends and topic dissemination and showing the relevance of publishing authors, institutions, and countries. METHODS: The Scopus database was comprehensively searched for all indexed documents published between January 1, 2020, and June 11, 2020, dealing with COVID-19 in the pediatric population (0-18 years). A machine learning bibliometric methodology was applied to evaluate the total number of papers and citations, journal and publication types, the top productive institutions and countries and their scientific collaboration, and core keywords. RESULTS: A total of 2301 papers were retrieved, with an average of 4.8 citations per article. Of this, 1078 (46.9%) were research articles, 436 (18.9%) were reviews, 363 (15.8%) were letters, 186 (8.1%) were editorials, 7 (0.3%) were conference papers, and 231 (10%) were categorized as others. The studies were published in 969 different journals, headed by The Lancet. The retrieved papers were published by a total of 12,657 authors from 114 countries. The most productive countries were the United States, China, and Italy. The four main clusters of keywords were pathogenesis and clinical characteristics (keyword occurrences: n=2240), public health issues (n=352), mental health (n=82), and therapeutic aspects (n=70). CONCLUSIONS: In the pediatric field, a large number of articles were published within a limited period on COVID-19, testifying to the rush to spread new findings on the topic in a timely manner. The leading authors, countries, and institutions evidently belonged to the most impacted geographical areas. A focus on the pediatric population was often included in general articles, and pediatric research about COVID-19 mainly focused on the clinical features, public health issues, and psychological impact of the disease.",A Global Overview of COVID-19 Research in the Pediatric Field: Bibliometric Review
"Introduction The governing bodies for dentistry in the UK and Ireland require dentists, at graduation, to possess the knowledge, skills and attributes which enable them to practise safely, without supervision. The means by which dental schools achieve this may differ and may undergo modification in response to changes in the expectations of governing bodies and challenges within the teaching environment. It is therefore important to identify which of these approaches works well and to disseminate good practice described in the literature. Objectives To use a scoping review to identify from the published literature the methods used to teach clinical dental skills, including innovations, motivations for changes, and factors affecting the delivery and quality of teaching. Method Scoping review methodology was used to select and analyse 57 articles published between 2008 and 2018. Results Innovations in didactic teaching were facilitated by advances in IT and development of virtual learning environments, which promoted independent, self-directed learning. Pre-clinical practical teaching took place in clinical techniques laboratories utilising mannequin heads, with a minority of dental schools using virtual reality simulators in addition. Clinical experience was gained mainly in multi-disciplinary clinics and offsite outreach teaching centres. Insufficient numbers of suitable patients, increasing student numbers and a fall in teaching staff contributed to a reported reduction in clinical experience of certain treatments. Conclusions Contemporary clinical dental skills teaching produces new graduates who possess excellent theoretical knowledge, are prepared and confident in basic clinical skills, but are lacking in experience of complex treatments which may result in a reduced preparedness for independent practice.

However, the primary healthcare delivery system in India is still in its initial stages and lacks human resources. With the COVID-19 pandemic around the corner, there has been a diversion of resources for controlling corona pandemic leading to undermining availability and accessibility of health services. This article highlights a few case scenarios and the multidimensional impact of lockdown on primary healthcare services. The article suggests certain appropriate measures that can be implemented as the lockdown simply cannot stop the transmission with no definite treatment and vaccine.

"There is some recent evidence that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of venous thromboembolism by creating a prothrombotic state. COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism (PE) are both associated with tachypnoea, hypoxemia, dyspnoea, and increased D-dimer. Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a patient with COVID-19 compared to an individual without it, using the conventional clinical and biochemical evidence is challenging and somehow impossible. In this study, we reported four male cases affected by COVID-19 and admitted to hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran. The patients were all older adults (ranging between 56 and 95 years of age). Fever, chills, muscle pain, and cough were evident in all the cases. Red blood cell levels were low, and pulmonary embolism was clearly detected on spiral computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the pulmonary circulation of all patients. These cases demonstrated that COVID-19 may lead to pulmonary embolism by causing blood coagulation problems. As COVID-19 continues to cause considerable mortality, more information is emerging which reveals its complicated pathogenicity. In the meantime, venous thromboembolism remains an uncommon finding in patients with COVID-19. It is essential that health care providers perform the necessary diagnostic evaluations and provide appropriate treatment for patients.",Increased pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19: a case series and literature review
"BACKGROUND: Students who are targets of bullying and who witness bullying are at high risk for negative mental health outcomes. Bystander training is essential to reduce bullying and the negative associated consequences for targets and bystanders. Resources necessary for program delivery, however, pose significant barriers for schools, particularly those in rural, low-income communities. Technology-based programs can reduce health disparities for students in these communities through cost-effective, easy-to-disseminate programming. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct usability testing of a bystander bullying web app prototype, STAC-T (technology-based STAC, which stands for the 4 bystander strategies Stealing the Show, Turning it Over, Accompanying Others, and Coaching Compassion) as an initial step in the development of a full-scale STAC-T intervention. Objectives include assessing usability and acceptability of the STAC-T prototype, understanding school needs and barriers to program implementation, and assessing differences in usability between school personnel and students. METHODS: A sample of 16 participants, including school personnel and students recruited from 3 middle schools in rural, low-income communities, completed usability testing followed by a qualitative interview. Descriptive statistics, 2-tailed independent sample t tests, and consensual qualitative research were used to assess usability and program satisfaction and to extract themes related to acceptability, feasibility, needs, barriers, and feedback for intervention development. RESULTS: Usability testing indicated that the app was easy to use, acceptable, and feasible. Both school personnel (mean rating 89.6, SD 5.1) and students (mean rating 91.8, SD 7.0) rated the app well above the standard cutoff score for above-average usability (ie, 68), and both school personnel (mean rating 5.83, SD 0.41) and students (mean rating 6.10, SD 0.57) gave the app high user-friendliness ratings (0-7 scale, with 7 as high user-friendliness). The overall ratings also suggested that school personnel and students were satisfied with the program. Of the 6 school personnel who said they would recommend the program, 1 (17%), 4 (66%), and 1 (17%) rated the program as 3, 4, and 5 stars, respectively; 80% (8/10) of students said they would recommend the program; and 60% (6/10) and 40% (4/10) rated the program as 4 stars and 5 stars, respectively. Qualitative data revealed that school personnel and students found the STAC-T app to be useful, user-friendly, and relevant, while providing feedback related to the importance of digital learning activities that engage the user. Data from school personnel also indicated positive perceptions regarding program feasibility and probability of program adoption, with the most significant barrier being cost, suggesting the importance of considering the financial resources available to schools in rural, low-income communities when setting the price point for the full-scale STAC-T intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for the full-scale development of the STAC-T app and provides key information for revision to enhance used engagement.

"This article examines the agency of four language teachers, and the affordances and constraints in their achievement of agency, as their routines were disrupted by the sudden shift to emergency online teaching due to the global pandemic, COVID-19. Within this larger shared critical incident, this article discusses the unique critical incidents that prompted each teacher to reflect on their practice, the agency they enacted and factors influencing the actions taken. This study provides further evidence that teachers exercise their agency in line with their professional identities, and illustrates that social structural factors feature prominently in teachers' identities and enactment of agency. The practical-evaluative dimension of agency is also further elucidated with evidence that teachers use their agency to maximise the benefits, evaluating the ‘solution’ adopted as an appropriate response to multiple concerns and goals. This study has important implications for teacher development highlighting the need for professional development programmes to better prepare teachers for the diversity of teaching situations which they may encounter, particularly in relation to differences in the role of the teacher, and the power dynamics and relationships between teacher, learner(s), and parents in different teaching modes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Language teacher agency in emergency online teaching
"Although fistulae between the urinary bladder and the gastrointestinal tract are not uncommon, those caused by carcinoma of the urinary bladder are rare. This report describes the case of an 85 years old male who was diagnosed with a mass involving the small bowel and the urinary bladder during the course of investigation for recurrent urinary tract infections. At laparotomy, the presence of an enterovesical fistula involving the ileum and bladder was confirmed. Histopathological examination of the resected mass showed poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma. No early postoperative complications were encountered and postoperative cystography showed healing of the bladder without evidence of leakage. Due to the patient's age and comorbidities, no further oncological treatment was offered. Three months later the patient was readmitted to hospital with a severe pneumonia to which he succumbed.",Enterovesical Fistula Secondary to Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder.

"Co-infections with different variants of SARS-CoV-2 are a key precursor to recombination events that are likely to drive SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Rapid identification of such co-infections is required to determine their frequency in the community, particularly in populations at-risk of severe COVID-19, which have already been identified as incubators for punctuated evolutionary events. However, limited data and tools are currently available to detect and characterise the SARS-CoV-2 co-infections associated with recognised variants of concern. Here we describe co-infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Omicron and Delta in two epidemiologically unrelated adult patients with chronic kidney disease requiring maintenance haemodialysis. Both variants were co-circulating in the community at the time of detection. Genomic surveillance based on amplicon- and probe-based sequencing using short- and long-read technologies identified and quantified subpopulations of Delta and Omicron viruses in respiratory samples. These findings highlight the importance of integrated genomic surveillance in vulnerable populations and provide diagnostic pathways to recognise SARS-CoV-2 co-infection using genomic data.",Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants revealed by genomic surveillance
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common co-morbidity associated with COVID-19 and the fatality rate in COVID-19 patients with CVD is higher compared to other comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. Preliminary data suggest that COVID-19 may also cause or worsen cardiac injury in infected patients through multiple mechanisms such as 'cytokine storm', endotheliosis, thrombosis, lymphocytopenia etc. Autopsies of COVID-19 patients reveal an infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells in the myocardium, confirming the role of the immune system in mediating cardiovascular damage in response to COVID-19 infection and also suggesting potential causal mechanisms for the development of new cardiac pathologies and/or exacerbation of underlying CVDs in infected patients. In this review, we discuss the potential underlying molecular mechanisms that drive COVID-19-mediated cardiac damage, as well as the short term and expected long-term cardiovascular ramifications of COVID-19 infection in patients.",Cardiac inflammation in COVID-19: Lessons from heart failure
"Acute lung injury (ALI) caused by acid aspiration often accompanies bacterial components leading to exaggerated inflammation and can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the underlying mechanisms behind such an exacerbation remain unclear. NLRP3 inflammasome and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) have been implicated in ALI but its role in injury caused through two hit i.e. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is not known. Therefore, the present study is designed to elucidate the role of mtROS-NLPR3 inflammasome upon ""two-hit"" mediated ALI. Our data showed that ""two-hit"" induced ALI results in aggravated lung inflammation as compared to either of single hit(s) as reflected by a steep increase in inflammatory cells particularly neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Further, enhanced inflammation was associated with increased mtROS as depicted by data on mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MitoSOX+ neutrophils and macrophages in BALF of two-hit simulated mice. Importantly, ALI results in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome as reflected by active caspase-1 protein expression and IL-1β levels. Interestingly, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, MCC950 suppressed the lung inflammation remarkably. Further, Mito-tempo, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, halted ""two-hit"" mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β release followed by amelioration of lung inflammation. Suppression in MFI of MitoSOX+ stained neutrophils and macrophages by Mito-tempo was associated with down-regulation of phospho-p65-NF-κB and its dependent genes (IL-1β/TNF-α/IL-6). Overall, our data suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation by mtROS plays a critical role in pathogenesis of exaggerated inflammation and therefore targeting mtROS-NLRP3 inflammasome axis may be an attractive option for combating ALI/ARDS.",Implication of mitochondrial ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome axis during two-hit mediated acute lung injury in mice.
"Background: Pediatric nurses care for some of the most vulnerable patients in our healthcare system. Research on health care provider organizational behavior shows that the quality of care nurses provide is directly related to their well-being, influenced by Burnout and job stress, in the workplace. However, most of the research conducted on nursing populations neglects to separately study nurses who care for children. In a resource limited system where health care provider well-being is recognized as a priority, it is important for administrators to understand the environmental and attitudinal work factors most influential to pediatric nurse work outcomes in order to target optimization strategies. The aim of the study was to identify which modifiable work environment factors, e.g., [Incivility, Perceived Organizational Support, Quality of Work-life] make the greatest contribution to the work outcome of Burnout (i.e., Personal Accomplishment, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization) in pediatric nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used at a large quaternary care pediatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. We administered a survey to a convenience sample of all registered nurses with >3 months experience in the Pediatric, Cardiac, and Neonatal Intensive Care Units from January 2021–March 2021. Path analysis was used to test our proposed model which was specified a priori based on a review of the literature. Results: 143 nurses completed the survey. Path analysis of the tested model resulted in good fit. Quality of Work-life had the largest direct effect on Work Engagement (β = 0.582, S.E. = 0.111, p < 0.001). Work Engagement had the largest direct effect on Personal Accomplishment (β = 0.68, S.E. = 0.53, p < 0.001). Quality of Work-life had the largest indirect effect on Personal Accomplishment (β = 0.4, S.E. = 0.65, p < 0.001), Emotional Exhaustion (β = −0.33, S.E. = 0.87, p < 0.001), and Depersonalization (β =−0.17, S.E. = 0.41, p = 0.006), respectively. Work Engagement had the largest total effect on Personal Accomplishment (β = 0.68, S.E. = 0.64, p < 0.001) and the third largest total effect on Emotional Exhaustion (β = −0.57, S.E. = 0.83, p < 0.001). Quality of Work-life had the second largest total effect on Work Engagement (β = 0.58, S.E. = 0.11, p < 0.001) indicating that Quality of Work-life is mediated through Work Engagement for its effect on Burnout. Conclusions: Our results indicate work environment and work attitude factors that can provide organizational leadership with a targeted focus to reduce pediatric critical care nurse Burnout, and thus improve provider well-being, in a resource limited system.","The Relationships Amongst Pediatric Nurses' Work Environments, Work Attitudes, and Experiences of Burnout"
"BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection may be at risk of severe disease complications when they also have comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and/or asthma. However, the prevalence of these co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been systematically reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and evaluate their possible contributions to disease severity. METHODS: A search strategy was developed for online databases. Search terms used were “Chikungunya” AND “Diabetes, Hypertension, Stroke, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases, Obesity, OR Asthma”. Only 11 articles documenting the frequency of comorbidities in CHIKV were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity. RESULTS: Among 2,773 CHIKV patients, hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (31.3%; 95%CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95%CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95%CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (7.9%; 95%CI: 3.3-17.7). There was 4- to 5-fold significant increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases in CHIKV patients over 50 years of age compared to their younger counterparts. Severe CHIKV cases had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes than non-severe cases (p < 0.05). CHIKV patients with diabetes had OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.48; p = 0.0135) for developing severe infection outcome compared to those with no diabetes. CONCLUSION: Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac diseases may contribute to the severe outcome of CHIKV. Diabetic subjects may be at higher risk of severe infection. These findings may be relevant in developing public health measures and practices targeting CHIKV patients with comorbidities to avert the severe outcome of the infectious disease.",Prevalence of chronic comorbidities in chikungunya: A systematic review and meta-analysis
"Japan has experienced several appreciation episodes. These appreciations may squeeze profit margins and lower export volumes. This paper investigates whether firms can weather appreciation periods by producing differentiated rather than commoditized products. To do this it investigates different sectors within the Japanese transportation equipment industry. Results from estimating pricing-to-market (PTM) coefficients indicate that firms producing differentiated products can pass-through more of exchange rate appreciations into higher foreign currency prices and thus better preserve their profit margins. Results from estimating trade elasticities are consistent with the PTM results and indicate that the automobile industry has exported much less than predicted after the yen depreciated in 2012. Finally, estimates of the stock market exposure across sectors indicates that the profitability of firms producing differentiated products is less exposed to appreciations. Producing differentiated, knowledge-intensive goods can thus help firms to survive endaka periods.",How Japanese firms can weather endaka periods: Evidence from the transportation equipment industry
Anastomotic leak after low anterior resection (LAR) in patients with rectal cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiation can be challenging to treat and can lead to the creation of a permanent stoma. We report the case of a post-operative anastomotic leak after a Baker-type anastomosis during a low anterior resection was successfully managed with transanal endoscopic microsurgical (TEM) debridement and repair. TEM can be a successful endoluminal alternative treatment in the management of anastomotic leak after LAR and can prevent the morbidity associated with re-exploration and colostomy.,Management of anastomotic leak after low anterior resection with transanal endoscopic microsurgical (TEM) debridement and repair.
"Objectives: To evaluate the perceptions of clinical dental students on the role of online education in providing dental education during the COVID-19 crisis. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was sent to four Egyptian dental schools from the 20th of January 2021 to the 3rd of February 2021. Survey questions included the demographics, uses, experiences, perceived benefits, and barriers of distance learning in dentistry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were collected from the clinical dental school students. Categorical data were presented as frequencies (n) and percentages (%) and were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Results: Three hundred thirty-seven clinical dental students across four Egyptian dental schools responded. Most students used either Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams to access the online content. The data showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the academic performance of most participants (97.4%) with varying degrees. On average, students were neutral when asked to rate the online lectures, but did not find online practical education as effective (81.3%) as online theoretical teaching. The commonly described barriers to online teaching included loss of interaction with educators, inappropriateness in gaining clinical skills, and the instability of the internet connection. Conclusion: Despite the reported benefits, clinical dental students in Egypt preferred the hybrid approach in dental education as distance learning represented a prime challenge to gain adequate clinical dental skills.",Perceptions of Clinical Dental Students Toward Online Education During the COVID-19 Crisis: An Egyptian Multicenter Cross-Sectional Survey
"The relevance of cyclin D1 (CCND1) has been implicated in lung cancer progression. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which CCND1 supports lung cancer development is yet to be expounded. Here, we established that CCND1 is overexpressed in clinical lung cancer specimens and various lung cancer cells. Importantly, CCND1 overexpression enhanced lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and arrested the cell cycle at the S phase. In vivo, overexpression of CCND1 promoted lung cancer growth and metastasis. The nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) promoted p65 protein expression and CCND1 transcription. Meanwhile, PI3K/AKT pathway activity was significantly reduced when NF-κB nuclear translocation was decreased. PI3K/AKT pathway activity was significantly elevated upon CCND1 overexpression. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway activity or suppression of NF-κB translocation in cells with high CCND1 expression was found to significantly reduce the activity of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data revealed that NF-κB/CCND1/PI3K/AKT axis could act as a prospective diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic option for lung cancer.",Cyclin D1 mediated by the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B exerts an oncogenic role in lung cancer
"Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a team-based institutional infrastructure for navigating management of a novel disease, to determine a safe and effective approach for performing tracheostomies in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure, and to review outcomes of patients and healthcare personnel following implementation of this approach. Methods: An interdisciplinary Task Force was constructed to develop innovative strategies for management of a novel disease. A single-institution prospective non-randomized cohort study was then conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy using an induced bedside apneic technique at a tertiary care academic institution between April 27th, 2020, and June 30th, 2020. Results: 28 patients underwent tracheostomy with induced apnea. The median lowest procedural oxygen saturation was 95%. The median number of ventilated days following tracheostomy was 11. There were 3 mortalities (11%) due to sepsis and multiorgan failure; of 25 surviving patients, 100% were successfully discharged from the hospital and 76% are decannulated, with a median time of 26 days from tracheostomy to decannulation (range 12 - 57). There was no symptomatic disease transmission to healthcare personnel on the COVID-19 Tracheostomy Team. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease may benefit from tracheostomy. This can be completed effectively and safely, without viral transmission to healthcare personnel. Performing tracheostomies earlier in the course of disease may expedite patient recovery and improve ICU resource utilization. Creation of a collaborative Task Force is an effective strategic approach for management of novel disease.",Controlled Apneic Tracheostomy in Patients with COVID-19
"Peripheral nerve injury and the associated muscle atrophy has an estimated annual healthcare burden of $150 billion dollars in the United States. When considering the total annual health-related spending of $3.5 trillion, these pathologies alone occupy about 4.3%. The prevalence of these ailments is rooted, at least in part, in the lack of specific preventative therapies that can be administered to muscle while it remains in the denervated state. To address this, skeletal muscle-derived ECM (skECM) was injected directly in denervated muscle with postoperative analysis performed at 20 weeks, including gait analysis, force production, cytokine quantification, and histological analysis. skECM was shown to be superior against non-injected muscle controls showing no difference in contraction force to uninjured muscle at 20 weeks. Cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, and IFNγ appeared to mediate regeneration with statistical regression implicating these cytokines as strong predictors of muscle contraction, showing significant linear correlation.",Intramuscular injection of skeletal muscle derived extracellular matrix mitigates denervation atrophy after sciatic nerve transection
"Social networks have become a major platform for people to disseminate information, which can include negative rumors. In recent years, rumors on social networks has caused grave problems and considerable damages. We attempted to create a method to verify information from numerous social media messages. We propose a general architecture that integrates machine learning and open data with a Chatbot and is based cloud computing (MLODCCC), which can assist users in evaluating information authenticity on social platforms. The proposed MLODCCC architecture consists of six integrated modules: cloud computing, machine learning, data preparation, open data, chatbot, and intelligent social application modules. Food safety has garnered worldwide attention. Consequently, we used the proposed MLODCCC architecture to develop a Food Safety Information Platform (FSIP) that provides a friendly hyperlink and chatbot interface on Facebook to identify credible food safety information. The performance and accuracy of three binary classification algorithms, namely the decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine algorithms, operating in different cloud computing environments were compared. The binary classification accuracy was 0.769, which indicates that the proposed approach accurately classifies using the developed FSIP.",Integrating machine learning and open data into social Chatbot for filtering information rumor

"Background: Information regarding the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with liver injury is very limited, especially in severe and critical patients. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and clinical course of liver function in patients admitted with severe and/or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as explore the risk factors that affect liver function in the enrolled COVID-19 patients. Methods: : Information on clinical characteristics of 63 severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 were collected and analyzed. Results: : The incidence of abnormal aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin in the critical group was significantly higher than in the severe group (respectively 81.48%, 81.49%, 62.67%, and 45.71%, 63.88%, 22.86%, p＜0.05). The time for liver function parameters to reach their extremes was approximately 2-3 weeks after admission. The independent factors associated with liver injury were patients with invasive ventilators, decreased percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 (p＜0.05). Conclusions: : Abnormal liver tests are commonly observed in severe and critical patients with COVID-19. The patients with severe illness should be closely observed to monitor liver function parameters, particularly when they present with independent risk factors of liver injury.",Clinical Course and Risk Factors for Liver Injury of Severe and Critical Patients With COVID-19
"The levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription of FOXP3, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-6 and COX-2 from both COVID-19 infected and control subjects were evaluated using SYBR(TM) green real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Severe/critical cases showed significantly lower lymphocyte counts and higher neutrophil counts than the mild or moderate cases. There were significantly lower levels of mRNA expressions of IFN-γ, TNFα and FOXP3 in COVID-19 patients than in the control group. On the other hand, IL-6 and COX-2 expressions were significantly higher in patients suffering from severe disease. FOXP3 expressions were correlated with the severities of hypoxia and were excellent in predicting the disease severity. This was followed by the IL-6, COX-2 and TNFα expressions. FOXP3 expression was the only biomarker to show a significant correlation with patient mortality. It was concluded that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the downregulation of FOXP3 and upregulations of IL-6 and COX-2.",Upregulation of FOXP3 is associated with severity of hypoxia and poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients
"COVID-19 had a huge mortality impact in the US in 2020 and accounted for the majority of the 1.5-year reduction in 2020 life expectancy at birth. There were also substantial racial/ethnic disparities in the mortality impact of COVID-19 in 2020, with the Black and Latino populations experiencing reductions in life expectancy at birth over twice the reduction experienced by the White population. Despite continued vulnerability of the Black and Latino populations, the hope was that widespread distribution of effective vaccines would mitigate the overall impact and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in 2021. In this study, we use cause-deleted life table methods to estimate the impact of COVID-19 mortality on 2021 US period life expectancy. Our partial-year estimates, based on provisional COVID-19 deaths for January-early October 2021 suggest that racial/ethnic disparities have persisted and that life expectancy at birth in 2021 has already declined by 1.2 years from pre-pandemic levels. Our projected full-year estimates, based on projections of COVID-19 deaths through the end of 2021 from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, suggest a 1.8-year reduction in US life expectancy at birth from pre-pandemic levels, a steeper decline than the estimates produced for 2020. The reductions in life expectancy at birth estimated for the Black and Latino populations are 1.6-2.4 times the impact for the White population.",Reductions in US life expectancy from COVID-19 by Race and Ethnicity: Is 2021 a repetition of 2020?
"Background and Purpose- Collateral circulation status at baseline is associated with functional outcome after ischemic stroke and effect of endovascular treatment. We aimed to identify clinical and imaging determinants that are associated with collateral grade on baseline computed tomography angiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Methods- Patients included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands; n=500) and MR CLEAN Registry (n=1488) were studied. Collateral status on baseline computed tomography angiography was scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to test the association of selected determinants with collateral status. Results- In total, 1988 patients were analyzed. Distribution of the collateral status was as follows: absent (7%, n=123), poor (32%, n=596), moderate (39%, n=735), and good (23%, n=422). Associations for a poor collateral status in a multivariable model existed for age (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 per 10 years [95% CI, 0.886-0.98]), male (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.76]), blood glucose level (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]), and occlusion of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus (adjusted common odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI, 0.41-0.61]). In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between cardiovascular risk factors and collateral status. Conclusions- Older age, male sex, high glucose levels, and intracranial internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus occlusions are associated with poor computed tomography angiography collateral grades in patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for endovascular treatment.",Clinical and Imaging Determinants of Collateral Status in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke in MR CLEAN Trial and Registry.
"Masks are used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to limit transmission and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research about the impact of mask-wearing in the COVID-19 pandemic has raised formidable interest across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mask-wearing in spreading processes over complex networks. This is done by studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network model, where nodes can be one of two types (mask-wearing, and not-mask-wearing). We provide analytical results that accurately predict the expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities, inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al.",Analysis of the Impact of Mask-wearing in Viral Spread: Implications for COVID-19
"The emerging novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 presents with high infectivity, morbidity and mortality. It presenting a need for immediate understanding of its pathogenicity. Inflammation and coagulation systems are over-activated in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 damages endothelial cell and pneumocyte, resulting in hemostatic disorder and ARDS. An influential biomarkers of poor outcome in COVID-19 are high circulating cytokines and D-dimer level. This latter is due to hyper-fibrinolysis and hyper-coagulation. Plasmin is a key player in fibrinolysis and is involved in the cleavage of many viruses envelop proteins, including SARS-CoV. This function is similar to that of TMPRSS2, which underpins the entry of viruses into the host cell. In addition, plasmin is involved in the pathophysiology of ARDS in SARS and promotes secretion of cytokine, such as IL-6 and TNF, from activated macrophages. Here, we suggest an out-of-the-box treatment for alleviating fibrinolysis and the ARDS of COVID-19 patients. This proposed treatment is concomitant administration of an anti-fibrinolytic drug and the anticoagulant.",COVID-19-Associated Hyper-Fibrinolysis: Mechanism and Implementations
"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been challenging human health worldwide. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been promptly applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 owing to its high amplification efficacy and less requirement of the thermal cycler. However, the vast majority of these LAMP-based assays depend on the non-specific detection of LAMP products, which can not discern the undesirable amplificons, likely to yield unreliable results. Herein, a sequence-specific LAMP assay was reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. This assay, introducing a proofreading enzyme and the fluorogenic probe to reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-Proofman-LAMP), can specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a detection limit of 100 copies. In addition to the real-time analysis, the assay is capable of endpoint visualization under a transilluminator within 50 min, providing a convenient reporting manner under the setting of point-of-care testing (POCT). In combination with different fluorophores, the one-pot multiplex assay was successfully achieved to detect multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and inner control simultaneously. In summary, the development of RT-Proofman-LAMP offers a versatile and highly-specific method for fast field screening and laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2, making it a promising platform in COVID-19 diagnosis.",Sequence-specific and multiplex detection of COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage coupled with isothermal amplification
"BACKGROUND Differentiating combined pulmonary fibrosis with emphysema (CPFE) from pure emphysema can be challenging on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). This has antifibrotic therapy implications. METHODS Twenty patients with suspected CPFE underwent late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) and HRCT. Data from twelve healthy control subjects from a previous study who underwent thoracic LGE-MRI were included for comparison. Quantitative LGE signal intensity (SI) was retrospectively compared in regions of fibrosis and emphysema in CPFE patients to similar lung regions in controls. Qualitative comparisons for the presence/extent of reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis between LGE-MRI and HRCT were assessed by two readers in consensus. RESULTS There were significant quantitative differences in fibrosis SI compared to emphysema SI in CPFE patients (25.8, IQR 18.4-31.0 versus 5.3, IQR 5.0-8.1, p < 0.001). Significant differences were found between LGE-MRI and HRCT in the extent of reticulation (12.5, IQR 5.0-20.0 versus 25.0, IQR 15.0-26.3, p = 0.038) and honeycombing (5.0, IQR 0.0-10.0 versus 20.0, IQR 10.6-20.0, p = 0.001) but not traction bronchiectasis (10.0, IQR 5-15 versus 15.0, IQR 5-15, p = 0.878). Receiver operator curve analysis of fibrosis SI compared to similarly located regions in control subjects showed an area under the curve of 0.82 (p = 0.002). A SI cutoff of 19 yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 86% in differentiating fibrosis from similarly located regions in control subjects. CONCLUSION LGE-MRI can differentiate CPFE from pure emphysema and may be a useful adjunct test to HRCT in patients with suspected CPFE.",Differentiating combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema from pure emphysema: utility of late gadolinium-enhanced MRI.
"Compensatory health beliefs (CHBs) are a means to cope with motivational conflicts between intended health goals and the temptation for an unhealthy behavior. As CHBs can fluctuate on a daily basis, this study examined how daily CHBs are associated with daily intention to quit smoking and daily number of cigarettes smoked before and after a quit date at the between- and within-person level. The study comprised a prospective longitudinal design and investigated 83 women and 83 men for 32 consecutive days during an ongoing joint self-set quit attempt. Daily CHBs varied from day to day and between individuals. At the between-person level, higher women's mean CHBs were associated with lower intention (b = -0.23, p = 0.04) and at the 10% level with more cigarettes smoked after the quit date (rate ratio (RR) = 1.92, p = 0.07). At the within-person level, women's higher than usual CHBs were unrelated to intention to quit, but were related to less smoking before (RR = 0.96, p = 0.03) and at the 10% level after the quit date (RR = 0.91, p = 0.09). A marginally positive association between daily CHBs and smoking at the within-person level emerged for men. The negative effect of daily CHBs at the between-person level on smoking seems to unfold after the quit attempt and for women only.",Do Daily Compensatory Health Beliefs Predict Intention to Quit and Smoking Behavior?

"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare organisations have had to make adaptations to reduce the impact of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This has necessitated urgent reconfiguration within inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) services to ensure safety of patients and staff and seamless continuity of care provision. AIM: To describe the adaptations made by a large inflammatory bowel disease service, caring for over 3,500 IBD patients, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A diary record of responses to the pandemic were logged, and meeting minutes were reviewed. Data were recorded from IBD advice lines, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting minutes, infusion unit attendances, and electronic referral systems for the 8-week period from 9 March 2020 until 2 May 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: The IBD service at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (IBD Hull) instituted rapid structural and functional changes to the service. Outpatient services were suspended and substituted by virtual consultations, and inpatient services were reduced and moved to ambulatory care where possible. The delivery of biologic and immunomodulatory therapies was significantly modified to ensure patient and staff safety. There was a substantial increase in IBD advice line calls. CONCLUSION: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic required a prompt response, regular reassessment and planning, and continues to do so. We share our experience in of the successful adaptations made to our IBD service.","React, reset and restore: Adaptation of a large inflammatory bowel disease service during COVID-19 pandemic"
"Host-pathogen conflicts leave genetic signatures of variation in homologous host genes. Using these “molecular scars” as a guide, we discovered a vertebrate-specific MItochondrial STress Response circuit (MISTR). MISTR proteins are associated with electron transport chain factors and activated by stress signals such as interferon-gamma and hypoxia. Upon stress, ultraconserved miRNAs downregulate MISTR1 followed by replacement with paralogs MISTR AntiViral (MISTRAV) or MISTR Hypoxia (MISTRH), depending on the insult. While cells lacking MISTR1 are more sensitive to apoptotic triggers, cells lacking MISTRAV or expressing the poxvirus-encoded vMISTRAV exhibit resistance to the same insults. Rapid evolution signatures across primate genomes for MISTR1 and MISTRAV indicate ancient and ongoing conflicts with pathogens. MISTR proteins are also found in plants, yeasts, and an algal virus indicating ancient origins and suggesting diverse means of altering mitochondrial function under stress. The discovery of MISTR circuitry highlights the use of evolution-guided studies to reveal fundamental biological processes.",MISTR: A conserved MItochondrial STress Response network revealed by signatures of evolutionary conflict
"BACKGROUND: Higher COVID-19 incidence and morbidity have been documented for US Black and Hispanic populations but not as clearly for other racial and ethnic groups. Efforts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities can be confounded by the relationship between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. OBJECTIVE: Examine race/ethnicity and social vulnerability effects on COVID-19 outcomes in the San Francisco Bay Area, an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse region, using geocoded patient records from 2020 in the University of California, San Francisco Health system. KEY RESULTS: Higher social vulnerability, but not race/ethnicity, was associated with less frequent testing yet a higher likelihood of testing positive. Asian hospitalization rates (11.5%) were double that of White patients (5.4%) and exceeded the rates for Black (9.3%) and Hispanic patients (6.9%). A modest relationship between higher hospitalization rates and increasing social vulnerability was evident only for White patients. Hispanic patients had the highest years of expected life lost due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcomes were not consistently explained by greater social vulnerability. Asian individuals showed disproportionately high rates of hospitalization regardless of social vulnerability status. Study of the San Francisco Bay Area population not only provides valuable insights into the differential contributions of race/ethnicity and social determinants of health to COVID-19 outcomes but also emphasizes that all racial groups have experienced the toll of the pandemic, albeit in different ways and to varying degrees.","Differential Effects of Race/Ethnicity and Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 Positivity, Hospitalization, and Death in the San Francisco Bay Area"
"The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has an imbalance between demand and supply in Indonesia's manufacturing industry. The products needed to handle the spread of the virus are in high order, and there is even a product shortage. Products that are not required to prevent a pandemic have stagnated so that the manufacturing industry suddenly reduces capacity. Manufacturing companies need to coordinate quickly to be able to adjust the disruption. Manufacturing companies already have an integrated information technology system that has been the primary process in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP). Manufacturing companies make ERP their primary system, so they need to be updated and adjusted as needed. This study obtains a questionnaire from Indonesia's manufacturing industry using the google form link and distributed through social media WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. Data processing was carried out by using the partial least square of 285 manufacturing company respondents. The results showed that ERP sustainability was able to influence supply chain integration (internal and external). External integration has an impact on information quality, while internal integration does not affect. Supply chain integration and information quality affect increasing firm performance. Research makes a practical contribution to the industry in optimizing ERP systems in Pandemic conditions and a theoretical contribution to ERP sustainability as a mainstay in supply chain integration. © 2021, Growing Science.

"The genetic variations among individuals are one of the notable factors determining disease severity and drug response. Nowadays, COVID-19 pandemic has been adversely affecting many aspects of human life. We used the Tehran Cardio-Metabolic Genetic Study (TCGS) data that is an ongoing genetic study including the whole-genome sequencing of 1200 individuals and chip genotyping of more than 15,000 participants. Here, the effect of ACE2 variations by focusing on the receptor-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 protease were investigated through simulations study. After analyzing TCGS data, 570 genetic variations on the ACE2 gene, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) were detected. Interestingly, two observed missense variants, K26R and S331F, which only the first one was previously reported, can reduce the receptor affinity for the viral Spike protein. Moreover, our bioinformatics simulation of 3D structures and docking of proteins explains important details of ACE2-Spike and ACE2-TMPRSS2 interactions, especially the critical role of Arg652 of ACE2 for protease function of TMPRSS2 was uncovered. As our results show that the genetic variation of ACE2 can at least influence the affinity of this receptor to its partners, we need to consider the genetic variations on ACE2 as well as other genes in the pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 for designing efficient drugs and vaccines.",SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility influenced by ACE2 genetic polymorphisms: insights from Tehran Cardio-Metabolic Genetic Study

"Scholars have widely recognised the importance of academic relationships between students at the university. While much of the past research has focused on studying their influence on different aspects such as the students’ academic performance or their emotional stability, less is known about their dynamics and the factors that influence the formation and dissolution of linkages between university students in academic networks. In this paper, we try to shed light on this issue by exploring through stochastic actor-oriented models and student-level data the influence that a set of proximity factors may have on formation of these relationships over the entire period in which students are enrolled at the university. Our findings confirm that the establishment of academic relationships is derived, in part, from a wide range of proximity dimensions of a social, personal, geographical, cultural and academic nature. Furthermore, and unlike previous studies, this research also empirically confirms that the specific stage in which the student is at the university determines the influence of these proximity factors on the dynamics of academic relationships. In this regard, beyond cultural and geographic proximities that only influence the first years at the university, students shape their relationships as they progress in their studies from similarities in more strategic aspects such as academic and personal closeness. These results may have significant implications for both academic research and university policies.",Beyond cultural and geographical proximity: delving into the factors that influence the dynamics of academic relationships between students in higher education
"Study designSaliva has been proposed as valid alternative for nasopharyngeal swab for RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity is generally equivalent, and it comes with much less discomfort for the patient. While there is an overall good performance in the literature for adults, there is much less information on the use of saliva in children or in the general practitioners setting. MethodsWe tested a novel commercially available saliva collection kit with a virus inactivating and RNA stabilizing buffer (InActiv Blue(R)) in matched saliva and swab samples from 245 individuals, including 216 children, collected by general practitioners. ResultsBlind RT-qPCR testing of the saliva samples confirmed all 23 positives identified by swab testing (100% concordance), irrespective of age, presence of symptoms, or high-risk status. One childs saliva sample was found low positive while negative on the nasopharyngeal swab, resulting in an overall relative sensitivity of RT-qPCR saliva testing of 104.3%.

"The rise of global supply chains as well as attention to the Triple Bottom Line provides organizations with new conditions and strategy paradoxes to be dealt with when it comes to sustainability in supply chain management. This study of a large multinational organization with a strong Triple Bottom Line focus provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of control and governance mechanisms in supply chain context. Through the Levers of Control framework, the application of these mechanisms both internally and across organizational boundaries is shown. The interplay between levers helps in dealing with the in itself paradoxical nature of Triple Bottom Line goalsetting. The results show that the ""softer"" elements of the Triple Bottom Line, i.e., People and Planet, are approached with the lever associated with the beliefs system, which in turn enforces the boundary and interactive control systems. Ultimately, applying the Levers of Control in supply chain context might contribute to pursuing a holistic approach of sustainable supply chain management.",Levers of control for supply chain sustainability: Control and governance mechanisms in a cross-boundary setting
"The first confirmed case of novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States was reported on January 20, 2020. As of November 24, 2020, close to 12.2 million cases of COVID-19 was confirmed in the US, with over 255,958 deaths. The rapid transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its unusual and divergent presentation has strengthened the status of COVID-19 as a major public health threat. In this review, we aim to 1- discuss the epidemiological data from various COVID-19 patient cohorts around the world and the USA as well the associated risk factors; 2- summarize the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the underlying molecular mechanisms for the respiratory and cardiovascular manifestations; 3- highlight the potential treatments and vaccines as well as current clinical trials for COVID-19.",Pathophysiology and pharmacological management of pulmonary and cardiovascular features of COVID-19
"Owing to their unique functions in regulating glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism, PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) have drawn special attention for developing drugs to treat type-2 diabetes. By combining the lipid benefit of PPAR-alpha agonists (such as fibrates) with the glycemic advantages of the PPAR-gamma agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), the dual PPAR agonists approach can both improve the metabolic effects and minimize the side effects caused by either agent alone, and hence has become a promising strategy for designing effective drugs against type-2 diabetes. In this study, by means of the powerful “core hopping” and “glide docking” techniques, a novel class of PPAR dual agonists was discovered based on the compound GW409544, a well-known dual agonist for both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma modified from the farglitazar structure. It was observed by molecular dynamics simulations that these novel agonists not only possessed the same function as GW409544 did in activating PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma, but also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors. It was further validated by the outcomes of their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) predictions that the new agonists hold high potential to become drug candidates. Or at the very least, the findings reported here may stimulate new strategy or provide useful insights for discovering more effective dual agonists for treating type-2 diabetes. Since the “core hopping” technique allows for rapidly screening novel cores to help overcome unwanted properties by generating new lead compounds with improved core properties, it has not escaped our notice that the current strategy along with the corresponding computational procedures can also be utilized to find novel and more effective drugs for treating other illnesses.",Design Novel Dual Agonists for Treating Type-2 Diabetes by Targeting Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors with Core Hopping Approach
"A wearable C-shaped antenna based on a fabric material operating at 2.4 GHz frequency is proposed for use in flexible/wearable IoT medical systems. The wearable IoT device plays a key role in medical applications, and the antenna is a key part of it. Loading the presented antenna on the body models showed a frequency detuned with the gain and efficiency reduced from 1. 28 to −9 dB and 90% to 10%. In addition, the SAR did not meet the safety health requirement defined by the FCC or ICNIRP standards. Therefore, an “Artificial Magnetic Conductor” structure (AMC) is added to the C-shaped antenna to overcome these problems. The AMC acts as shielding material between the human skin and the presented antenna because of its 0° reflection phase, which mimics the action of the Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC). The overall size of the proposed design was 54 × 54 × 3.9 mm(3). Numerical and experimental findings indicated that integrating the AMC structures with a C-shaped antenna was robust for body deformation and load. The C-shaped antenna worked equally well with the AMC, whether positioned in free space or on the chest or the arm of the human body. The integrated antenna with AMC structures has excellent performances. The gain and efficiency without loading on the chest were 6.49 dB and 84%, respectively. While for loaded on the chest were 6.21 dB and 81%, respectively. It also decreased the back radiation and raised the Front to Back Ration (FBR) by 13.8 dB. SAR levels have been reduced by more than 90% between the FCC and ICNIRP standards compared to the C-shaped antenna alone, which does not comply with the standards. As a result, the C-shaped integration with AMC structures is highly suitable for assembly in any wearable system.

"We have recorded our experience of a “virtual” university biophysics laboratory using the Zoom meeting system, from April to June 2020, during the “stay home” period of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Japan. Because the specialty of our laboratory is experimental biophysics, careful planning was necessary for the continuation of research. We set several special research topics for teleworking, although some compromise was inevitable. Frequent meetings, seminars, and lectures using the Zoom meeting system were important to maintain laboratory activity. Meetings were carried out three times per day. Two types of seminars were held, as well as the “meeting-style” laboratory. Lectures by outsiders were also performed. As a result of these approaches, many students succeeded in presenting their telework research in autumn domestic conferences for biophysics and physics education in 2020. Furthermore, some students submitted papers to academic research journals by the end of the teleworking period.

"INTRODUCTION Between 2000 and 2020 Open Society Foundations was one of very few funders that supported global palliative care development and advocacy. OBJECTIVE To describe progress made in three priority areas-the integration of palliative care into public health systems, access to controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care-during those 20 years. METHODS Activities and developments between 2000 and 2020 on global integration of palliative care into health systems, access to and availability of controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care are described and analyzed. RESULTS Major progress has been made in each area. Whereas in 2000, integration of palliative care into public healthcare systems was on the agenda in just a few pioneering countries, by 2020 a global consensus had emerged that palliative care should be integral to all health systems including in universal health coverage and countries were increasingly taking steps to integrate it into national health systems. While limited availability of these medicines was barely recognized as a public health or drug control issue in 2000, it had become an important priority in global drug policy debates by 2020 and numerous countries had taken steps to improve access to these medicines. Pediatric palliative care, available mostly in a small number of wealthy countries in the 1990s, has seen rapid growth, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and now has a solid foothold in all world regions. DISCUSSION Despite this progress, significant challenges remain as funding for palliative care advocacy is limited, the overdose crisis in the US has recently had a chilling effect on efforts to improve availability of opioid analgesics, and economic crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic create uncertainty over the future of universal health coverage. KEYMESSAGES This article describes progress made in the last twenty years in three areas that were global funding priorities for the Open Society Foundations. It describes developments between 2000 and 2020 on global integration of palliative care into health systems, access to and availability of controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care.","Advancing Global Palliative Care over Two Decades: Health System Integration, Access to Essential Medicines, and Pediatrics."
"OBJECTIVE: Our main objective is to estimate the trend of deaths by COVID-19 on a global scale, considering the six continents. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective observational study conducted using the secondary data provided by the Our World in Data project on a public domain. SETTING: This study was conducted based on worldwide deaths by COVID-19 recorded for the Our World in Data project from 29 February 2020 to 17 February 2021. METHODS: Estimating the trend in COVID-19 deaths is not a trivial task due to the problems associated with the COVID-19 data, such as the spatial and temporal heterogeneity, observed seasonality and the delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, indicating a relevant measurement error problem and changing the series’ dependency structure. To bypass the aforementioned problems, we propose a method to estimate the components of trend, seasonality and cycle in COVID-19 data, controlling for the presence of measurement error and considering the spatial heterogeneity. We used the proposed model to estimate the trend component of deaths by COVID-19 on a global scale. RESULTS: The model was able to capture the patterns in the occurrence of deaths related to COVID-19, overcoming the problems observed in COVID-19 data. We found compelling evidence that spatiotemporal models are more accurate than univariate models to estimate the patterns of the occurrence of deaths. Based on the measures of dispersion of the models’ prediction in relation to observed deaths, it is possible to note that the models with spatial component are significantly superior to the univariate model. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the spatial dynamics have an important role in the COVID-19 epidemic process since the results provided evidence that spatiotemporal models are more accurate to estimate the general patterns of the occurrence of deaths related to COVID-19.",Estimating spatiotemporal patterns of deaths by COVID-19 outbreak on a global scale
"The experience gained over the last hundred years clearly indicates that two groups of viruses represent the main risk for the development of highly transmissible epidemics and pandemics in the human species: influenza viruses and coronaviruses (CoV). Although the search for viruses with pandemic potential in the environment may have an important predictive and monitoring role, it is still based on empirical methodologies, mostly translated from the clinic and not fully validated for environmental matrices.As far as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, currently underway, is concerned, environmental monitoring activities aiming at checking the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be extremely useful to predict and control the diffusion of the disease. For this reason, the present study aims to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion by means of a wastewater-based environmental monitoring developed in Piedmont, N-W Italy, during the pandemic second and third waves. Sampling strategies, sampling points, sample pre-treatments and analytical methods have been developed and validated to give representative and reliable results. The outcomes highlighted by the present paper demonstrate a strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentration in untreated wastewater and epidemic evolution in the considered areas as well as a predictive potential that could provide decision-makers with indications for establishing effective policies to mitigate the effects of the ongoing pandemic and to prepare response plans for future pandemics that could certainly arise in the decades to come.Moreover, the study highlights the potential of wastewater treatment plants to degrade the genetic material referable to SARS-CoV-2 as well.In conclusion, the preliminary data reported in the present paper, although they need to be complemented by further studies considering other geographical regions as well, are very promising.","Wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 Environmental Monitoring for Piedmont, Italy"
"Martial incidents during wars (World War I and II), but also shipping fatalities through centuries along the densely populated commercial routes of the Mediterranean Sea have resulted in significant submerged remnants, falling into the Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH) corps. A large part of this heritage is located in the neighborhood of insular territories. Preservation and sustainable exploitation of this UCH in the Mediterranean presents an important opportunity for both keeping alive the European identity for future generations, and tracking alternative, heritage-led future development trails for remote peripheral and lagging-behind island communities. The paper explores the context of UCH in the Mediterranean and elaborates on the value attached to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for reaping this opportunity by means of surveying, geolocating, preserving, sustainably exploiting and marketing this heritage. Based on this exploration, but also on the authors’ experience from a specific (U)CH-related cultural planning endeavor, conducted in Leros Island Greece, ICT and non-ICT related barriers for planning heritage-led future trails of insular regions are delineated.",Leveraging Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH) Potential for Smart and Sustainable Development in Mediterranean Islands
"Background: Acceptance of others' death is inherently difficult;therefore, throughout history, humans have avoided facing the reality of death. Mourning is a difficult experience in itself, and with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), it may become more complicated. Aim: This study aimed to explain the experience of bereaved families of patients with COVID-19. Method: This qualitative descriptive study used the conventional content analysis method. In total, 20 participants were purposefully selected and included in the study. The data were obtained through in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants' contact numbers were extracted from the archives of deceased COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 wards of educational hospitals of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences from August 22, 2020, to May 21, 2021, Tehran, Iran. The interviews continued until the data saturation. The interview lasted between 35 and 40 minutes. MAXQDA software (version 10) was used to analyze information. Results: The final theme of adaptation to the new world includes psychological symptoms (disbelief mourning and disease, and social stigma), role conflict (threatening context of multiple roles, bottleneck of mental and work hazards, and uncertain future), and miracle of belief and faith (inner peace with praying and distraction of thoughts). Implications for Practice: Given that one of the main concerns of the world following the COVID-19 pandemic is incomplete mourning and the resulting psychological disorders in the family, it is important to find a solution to support bereaved families to adapt to the new world without the deceased. © 2021 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

"The possible negative impact of severe adult respiratory distress caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) on antimicrobial stewardship and infection control has been postulated, but few real-life data are available. The aim of this study was to report our experience with colonization/infection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) and Candida auris among critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). All COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs at San Martino Policlinico Hospital–IRCCS in Genoa, Italy, were screened from 28 February to 31 May 2020. One-hundred and eighteen patients admitted to COVID-19 ICUs were included in the study. Among them, 12 (10.2%) became colonized/infected with CRPA, 6 (5.1%) with C. auris and 2 (1.6%) with CR-Kp. All patients with CRPA received prior treatment with meropenem, and in 11 (91.7%) infection was not preceded by colonization. Four patients (66.7%) developed C. auris candidemia. A significant spread of resistant pathogens was observed among critically ill COVID-19 patients.

"Infectious diseases cause tremendous costs of both human and economy annually. Previously, we have studied the bacterial, fungal, and allergen aerosol inactivation by direct microwave irradiation. Here, we further investigated its effects on airborne viruses. MS2 coliphage used as a human model virus was aerosolized and exposed to the direct microwave irradiation for ~2 min at three different power levels (700, 385, and 119 W). In addition to the survival rate, the viral genes before and after the microwave treatments were also examined using PCR and gel electrophoresis. Direct exposure of airborne MS2 viruses to the microwave irradiation at 700 W for less than 2 min was shown to result in more than 90 % inactivation efficiency, about 65 % at medium power level (385 W), and 50 % at the lowest level (119 W). The aerosol inactivation rate followed a linear relationship with the microwave exposure time (R (2) = 0.9889). Scanning electron images revealed visible damages to the viral surface after the exposure. Damages were also observed to the viral RNA genes coding for coat proteins, among which the A protein gene was completely destroyed. This study demonstrated that even without the filtration the direct microwave irradiation could also achieve rapid inactivation of viral aerosols. The information obtained can provide useful guidance on the development of microwave-based viral threat mitigation solutions in a closed or semi-closed space.",In situ airborne virus inactivation by microwave irradiation
"It is no exaggeration to say that American health policy is frequently subordinated to budgetary policies and procedures.

Yet fiscal politics determined the ACA's design and guided its implementation, as well as sometimes assisting and sometimes constraining efforts to repeal or replace it. In particular, the ACA's vulnerability to litigation has been the price its drafters paid in exchange for fiscal-political acceptability.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. SETTING: International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. RESULTS: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.",Incubation period of COVID-19: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research
"INTRODUCTION: To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, social-distancing policies such as school closure, stay-at-home orders, and indoor dining closure have been utilized worldwide. These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and result in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies. METHODS: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions. RESULTS: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSION: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.",Social-distancing fatigue: Evidence from real-time crowd-sourced traffic data
"Background: New data collection in established longitudinal population studies provides an opportunity for studying the risk factors and sequelae of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), plus the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on wellbeing. The Extended Cohort for E-health, Environment and DNA (EXCEED) cohort is a population-based cohort (N>11,000), recruited from 2013 in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland. EXCEED includes consent for electronic healthcare record (EHR) linkage, spirometry, genomic data, and questionnaire data. Methods: Between May 2020 and July 2021, a new questionnaire was deployed in EXCEED, which captured COVID-19 symptoms, general physical and mental health, plus socioeconomic and environmental factors during the pandemic. An online system was developed to invite new participants to join EXCEED, with informed consent being provided online. New and existing participants then completed the COVID-19 questionnaire online. A subset of the new questionnaire respondents were invited to participate in COVID-19 serology substudies, using home antibody testing kits. Results: In total, 3,693 participants provided COVID-19 infection status (median age 62.9 (IQR 54.7-69.2), 58.9% female). Trends of monthly incidence proportions of COVID-19 in EXCEED (self-report or symptom-predicted) approximated local and national figures. Regression analysis of 2,768 participants with linked EHR data showed no obvious monotonic relationship between number of chronic diseases (of 16 pre-specified diseases) and COVID-19 infection. There were 2,144 participants with valid results from a kit allowing differentiation between antibodies due to vaccination or infection. Of these, 8.5% had results consistent with previous COVID-19 infection, and 85.9% had evidence of COVID-19 vaccination, but without evidence of infection. Conclusions: Enriching EXCEED with a new COVID-19 questionnaire and serology data may improve understanding of the risk factors, clinical sequelae and broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Controlled access to these data for bona fide researchers is via application to the EXCEED study.","Extended Cohort for E-health, Environment and DNA (EXCEED) COVID-19 focus (preprint)"
"Poor health worker motivation, and the resultant shortages and geographic imbalances of providers, impedes the provision of quality care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review summarizes the evidence on interventions used to motivate health workers in LMICs. A standardized keyword search strategy was employed across five databases from September 2007 -September 2017. Studies had to meet the following criteria: original study; doctors and/or nurses as target population for intervention(s); work motivation as study outcome; study design with clearly defined comparison group; categorized as either a supervision, compensation, systems support, or lifelong learning intervention; and conducted in a LMIC setting. Two independent reviewers screened 3845 titles and abstracts and, subsequently, reviewed 269 full articles. Seven studies were retained from China (n = 1), Ghana (n = 2), Iran (n = 1), Mozambique (n = 1), and Zambia (n = 2). Study data and risk of bias were extracted using a standardized form. Though work motivation was the primary study outcome, four studies did not provide an outcome definition and five studies did not describe use of a theoretical framework in the ascertainment. Four studies used a randomized trial-group design, one used a non-randomized trial-group design, one used a cross-sectional design, and one used a pretest-posttest design. All three studies that found a significant positive effect on motivational outcomes had a supervision component. Of the three studies that found no effects on motivation, two were primarily compensation interventions and the third was a systems support intervention. One study found a significant negative effect of a compensation intervention on health worker motivation. In conducting this systematic review, we found there is limited evidence on successful interventions to motivate health workers in LMICs. True effects on select categories of health workers may have been obscured given that studies included health workers with a wide range of social and professional characteristics. Robust studies that use validated and culturally appropriate tools to assess worker motivation are greatly needed in the Sustainable Development Goals era.",Approaches to motivate physicians and nurses in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic literature review.
"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease entity that appeared in late 2019. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of loss of smell and/or taste among patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and identify demographic and clinical differences between patients with and without anosmia/dysgeusia. Methods: The study was performed in a referral center for COVID-19 in Istanbul, Turkey between the months of April and July 2020. The responses from a set of questions in regard to loss of sense of smell and/or taste were collected. None of these patients were exposed to any further examination or testing related to their senses of smell and/or taste. The data in regard to the patients being tested as well as their demographic information and co-morbidities associated with their condition were collected. Results: Twenty patients (10 male, 10 females, mean age 43.3 years) out of 86 patients (49 male, 37 female, median age 49.5 years), who tested positive for COVID-19, declared a loss of smell and/or taste. Nineteen patients (19/20, 95%) had a full recovery, and one (1/20, 5%) had partial recovery at the end of two weeks. Conclusion: Our results indicate that 23.3% of patients who tested positive with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19 had loss of sense of smell to a certain extent.","The prevalence of anosmia among patients with COVID-19 in Istanbul, Turkey: A cross-sectional study"

"Simple Summary: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy with a high incidence rate in females The COVID-19 epidemic posed an increased risk of treatment delay causing increased DTC morbidity and mortality rate of DTC Several imaging techniques, including ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computer tomography (CT), have been applied in the early screening and diagnosis of DTC However, these traditional methods have limited sensitivity and specificity due to dependence on the experience and skill of the radiologists Radiomics is an emerging technique that allows the quantitative extraction of high-throughput features from single or multiple medical images, which cannot be observed directly with the naked eye, and then applies to machine learning approaches to construct classification or prediction models This method makes it possible to evaluate tumor status and to differentiate malignant from benign tumors or nodules in a more objective manner To date, the classification and prediction value of radiomics in DTC patients have been inconsistent Herein, we summarize the available literature on the classification and prediction performance of radiomics-based DTC in various imaging techniques More specifically, we reviewed the recent literature to discuss the capacity of radiomics to predict lymph node (LN) metastasis, distant metastasis, tumor extrathyroidal extension, disease-free survival, and B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation and differentiate malignant from benign nodules This review discusses the application and limitations of the radiomics process, and explores its ability to improve clinical decision-making with the hope of emphasizing its utility for DTC patients [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Cancers is the property of MDPI Publishing and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Radiomics in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Nodules: Explorations, Application, and Limitations"
"The health situation of indigenous peoples has long been ignored. The health threat affecting them, linked to environmental degradation in general and climate change in particular, has been the subject of recent studies to assess it and consider the actions to be taken. The health crisis of COVID-19 has reinforced both the persistent health fragility of indigenous populations, but also the potential therapeutic potential of using traditional knowledge to address it. Thus, the evolution of States' recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples has raised awareness of the persistent inequalities in health, but it has also revealed that traditional knowledge is an essential lever for enhancing the rights of the peoples concerned as a means of improving their living conditions. Therefore, the integration of traditional therapeutic knowledge into the national health order, as has been done in Australia, not only brings recognition of traditional knowledge, but also improves the protection of the health of indigenous peoples.",Chapitre 3.

"Resumo: A COVID-19 tem representado um desafio global aos sistemas de saúde, expandindo em velocidade crescente de óbitos, de pacientes críticos com pneumonia e necessidade de suporte respiratório. Métodos alternativos para controlar a propagação da doença, como o isolamento social, medidas extremas de quarentena e o rastreio dos contactantes dos casos têm sido utilizados no mundo. Contudo, essas medidas podem não ser totalmente eficazes para combater a escalada da COVID-19 em compasso às preparações nacionais necessárias às novas demandas de cuidado. Ampla gama de tecnologias digitais pode ser usada para aprimorar essas estratégias de saúde pública, e a pandemia gerou um frenesi relacionado à telessaúde. No Brasil, esse campo tem crescido acentuadamente nos últimos anos. Todavia, a despeito da intensa proliferação de normativas, ainda inexistia, até a epidemia, um marco regulatório plenamente consolidado no país. O surgimento da COVID-19 marca um momento profícuo de expansão das aplicações e usos da telessaúde, como forma de melhorar a resposta do sistema de saúde à crise em curso.

"Over an 8 year period, 170 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 134 healthy controls were assessed at monthly intervals in order to ascertain environmental factors which might be important in producing exacerbation or progression of the illness, and to compare the frequency of common viral infections in the two groups. During cumulative periods designated ""at risk"" (2 weeks before the onset of infection until 5 weeks afterwards) annual exacerbation rates were almost 3-fold greater than those during periods not at risk. Approximately 9% of infections were temporally related to exacerbations, whereas 27% of exacerbations were related to infections. Frequency of common infections was approximately 20-50% less in MS patients than controls; it was progressively less in those with greater disability. Even in minimally disabled patients with similar potential for infectious contacts, the infection rate was significantly less than in controls, suggesting that MS patients could have superior immune defences against common viruses.",CLINICAL VIRAL INFECTIONS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: More than 292 million people are living with hepatitis B worldwide and are at risk of death from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set global targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. However, current levels of global investment in viral hepatitis elimination programmes are insufficient to achieve these goals. METHODS: To catalyse political commitment and to encourage domestic- and international-financing, we used published modelling data and key stakeholder interviews to develop an investment framework to demonstrate the return on investment for viral hepatitis elimination. RESULTS: The framework utilizes a public health approach to identify evidence-based national activities that reduce viral hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality, as well as international activities and critical enablers that allow countries to achieve maximum impact on health outcomes from investment to achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets. CONCLUSION: Focusing on hepatitis B, this health policy paper employs the investment framework to estimate the substantial economic benefits of investing in the elimination of hepatitis B and demonstrates how such investments could be cost-saving by 2030.",A global investment framework for the elimination of hepatitis B
"The present study aims to examine for the first time the emotional impact of the quarantine on children and adolescents from Italy and Spain, two of the most affected countries by COVID-19. 1,143 parents of Italian and Spanish children aged 3 to 18 years completed a survey providing information about how the quarantine affects their children and themselves, compared to before the home confinement. 85.7% of the parents perceived changes in their children´s emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine. The most frequent symptoms were difficulty concentrating (76.6%), boredom (52%), irritability (39%), restlessness (38.8%), nervousness (38%), feelings of loneliness (31.3%), uneasiness (30.4%), and worries (30.1%), and Spanish parents reported more symptoms than Italians. As expected, children of both countries used monitors more frequently, spent less time doing physical activity, and slept more hours during the quarantine. Furthermore, when family coexistence during quarantine became more difficult, the situation was more serious, and the level of stress was higher, parents tended to report more emotional problems in their children.The quarantine impacts considerably on Italian and Spanish youth, reinforcing the need to detect children with emotional and behavioral problems as early as possible to improve their psychological well-being.",Immediate psychological effects of the COVID-19 quarantine in youth from Italy and Spain
"BACKGROUND: Effective conservation management of highly mobile species depends upon detailed knowledge of movements of individuals across their range; yet, data are rarely available at appropriate spatiotemporal scales. Flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.) are large bats that forage by night on floral resources and rest by day in arboreal roosts that may contain colonies of many thousands of individuals. They are the largest mammals capable of powered flight, and are highly mobile, which makes them key seed and pollen dispersers in forest ecosystems. However, their mobility also facilitates transmission of zoonotic diseases and brings them in conflict with humans, and so they require a precarious balancing of conservation and management concerns throughout their Old World range. Here, we analyze the Australia-wide movements of 201 satellite-tracked individuals, providing unprecedented detail on the inter-roost movements of three flying-fox species: Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus, and P. scapulatus across jurisdictions over up to 5 years. RESULTS: Individuals were estimated to travel long distances annually among a network of 755 roosts (P. alecto, 1427-1887 km; P. poliocephalus, 2268-2564 km; and P. scapulatus, 3782-6073 km), but with little uniformity among their directions of travel. This indicates that flying-fox populations are composed of extremely mobile individuals that move nomadically and at species-specific rates. Individuals of all three species exhibited very low fidelity to roosts locally, resulting in very high estimated daily colony turnover rates (P. alecto, 11.9 ± 1.3%; P. poliocephalus, 17.5 ± 1.3%; and P. scapulatus, 36.4 ± 6.5%). This indicates that flying-fox roosts form nodes in a vast continental network of highly dynamic ""staging posts"" through which extremely mobile individuals travel far and wide across their species ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The extreme inter-roost mobility reported here demonstrates the extent of the ecological linkages that nomadic flying-foxes provide across Australia's contemporary fragmented landscape, with profound implications for the ecosystem services and zoonotic dynamics of flying-fox populations. In addition, the extreme mobility means that impacts from local management actions can readily reverberate across jurisdictions throughout the species ranges; therefore, local management actions need to be assessed with reference to actions elsewhere and hence require national coordination. These findings underscore the need for sound understanding of animal movement dynamics to support evidence-based, transboundary conservation and management policy, tailored to the unique movement ecologies of species.",Extreme mobility of the world's largest flying mammals creates key challenges for management and conservation
"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Prostate cancer is the leading cause of death in many countries. It is important to diagnose the disease in the early stages. Current methods detect the disease with low specificity. Examining the expression of genes responsible for disease and their epigenetic regulators are good tools in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 40 Iranian patients with cancer, 40 Iranian patients with prostate hyperplasia, and 40 control samples were examined. After blood sampling from each individual, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, GSTP1, HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expressions were measured in three understudy groups using specific primers and Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS: A reverse correlation was identified between loss of GSTP1 expression and overexpression of HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (P value < 0.0001) with a beneficial pattern of cancer development with high efficiency. The significant decrease of GSTP1 expression in patients in comparison to the healthy controls and the elevated expression levels of the studied epigenetic regulators in PCA and BPH samples indicate the impact of the regulators on GSTP1 expression activity. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the measurement of combined GSTP1 and its epigenetic regulators' expression could be used as suitable genetic markers for the detection and separation of healthy individuals from prostatic patient groups in the Iranian population. However, a similar study in a larger population of case and control could help us to distinguish between normal, benign, and malignant conditions.",Investigation of GSTP1 and epigenetic regulators expression pattern in a population of Iranian patient with prostate cancer
"OBJECTIVE: Although community practices towards disposal of expired and unused medications vary globally, the phenomenon is neglected specifically in developing countries. We, therefore, aimed to assess the disposal practices of unused and expired pharmaceuticals among the general public in Quetta city, Pakistan. METHODS: A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 830 respondents in Quetta city, Pakistan. A pre-validated, structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were coded and analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were sued and p<0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: Almost 87% of the respondents had unused medicines at their homes and reusing the medications was the purpose of medicine storage (50%). Medicines were mostly kept in refrigerators (36.0%) followed by bedrooms (28.8%). Fifty percent of the respondents never checked the expiry date before using the medications. The procedure to dispose of nearly expired or expired medicines was unknown to 88% of the respondents and for those reasons, medicines were disposed either in household trash or flushed in the toilet or sink. Interestingly, medicines were kept at home even after being expired by 27% of the respondents. Income was associated with reason of storing medicines (p = 0.004; φc = 0.402) while educational status had significant associations with storage of medications (p = 0.002; φc = 0.399), reading about storage instructions (p = 0.008; φc = 0.452) and checking expiry date before purchasing and using the medicines (p = 0.007; φc = 0.114 and p = 0.001; φc = 0.100) respectively. CONCLUSION: Improper storage and disposal of unused and expired medications is a common practice among study respondents and raised serious concerns. Findings of the current study call upon immediate development and implementation of the strategies to promote awareness and strengthen the pharmaceutical waste management program at the societal level.","Disposal practices of unused and expired pharmaceuticals among the general public in Quetta city, Pakistan"

"The American Society for Virology, the very first such Society to be formed anywhere, was founded at a meeting of some 40 virologists at Chicago O'Hare International airport on June 9, 1981. They met after a decade and a half of intense discussion that originated at the 9th International Congress of Microbiology in Moscow in 1966 when a small group of virologists requested the International Association of Microbiological Societies to form a Virology Section within IAMS, and this request was rejected. Virologists therefore held their own First International Congress of Virology in Helsinki in 1968 which was very successful and generated intense informal discussion among leading virologists in this country as to the desirability of founding an American society for virologists. Proposals were circulated and discussed which resulted in the informal Chicago meeting that created the mechanism for founding the ASV and organizing its 1st Annual Meeting at Cornell in Ithaca in August 1982.",How the American Society for Virology was founded.
"BACKGROUND In 2019, there were 70.8 million forcibly displaced people worldwide. Among the top causes of morbidity and mortality were measles, diarrhea, respiratory illness, and malaria. Availability of accurate diagnostics that are of low complexity, affordable, and produce timely results on site without the need for expensive laboratory equipment, extensive training, or distant transport of samples, are essential tools in the response to humanitarian emergencies (HE). Early detection of infectious diseases with epidemic potential and coordinated outbreak response, can result in significant decrease in morbidity and mortality. CONTENT This review explores the utility of point of care and rapid diagnostic tests (POCT/RDTs) in HE and presents a review and analysis of the low complexity, availability, and ease of use of these diagnostic modalities that make them helpful tools in these settings, despite the generally lower test performance metrics associated with them over conventional laboratory-based assays. We review the literature to understand how POCT/RDTs have been used in HE response to produce lifesaving information without the need for a robust system for transporting test samples to more sophisticated laboratories, as this is often prohibitive in areas affected by conflict or natural disasters. SUMMARY We propose that POCT/RDTs be considered essential healthcare tools provided to countries following a HE and suggest that UN agencies and vulnerable countries include effective RDTs in their essential diagnostics as part of their national preparedness and response plans.",Utility of Point of Care and Rapid Diagnostics in Humanitarian Emergencies.
"Background: Developing a safe and effective vaccine will be the principal way of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, current COVID-19 vaccination trials are not adequately representing a diverse participant population in terms of age, ethnicity and comorbidities. Achieving the representative recruitment targets that are adequately powered to the study remains one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial management. To ensure accuracy and generalizability of the safety and efficacy conclusions generated by clinical trials, it is crucial to recruit patient cohorts as representative as possible of the future target population. Missing these targets can lead to reduced validity of the study results, and can often slow down drug development leading to costly delays. This study explores the key factors related to perceptions and participation in vaccination trials. Methods: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK. Statistical analysis was done in six phases. Multi-nominal logistic models examined demographic and geographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. Results: The survey had 4884 participants of which 9·44% were BAME (Black Asian Minority Ethnic). Overall 2020 (41.4%) respondents were interested in participating in vaccine trials;27.6% of the respondents were not interested and 31.1.% were unsure. The most interested groups were male (OR=1.290), graduates (OR=1.277), the 40-49 and 50-59 age group (OR=1.880 and OR=1.460 respectively) and those with no health issues (OR=1.064). The least interested groups were BAME (OR=0.427), those from villages and small towns (OR=0.66 and 0.54 respectively), and those aged 70 and above (OR=1.11). Conclusions: : In order to have a vaccination that is generalizable to the entire population, greater work needs to be done in engaging a diverse cohort of participants. Public health campaigns need to be targeted in improving trial recruitment rates for the elderly, BAME community and the less educated rural population.",The UPTAKE study: Implications for the future of COVID-19 vaccination trial recruitment in UK and beyond

An interest in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the pinnacle of ECLS techniques, has recently increased, as for the last decade, we have observed improvements in the survival of patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) while on ECMO. Although there is a paucity of conclusive data from clinical research regarding extracorporeal oxygenation in COVID-19 patients, the pathophysiology of the disease makes veno-venous ECMO a promising option.",Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in COVID-19—Where Are We Now?
"PURPOSE Phase I trials are a crucial step in the evaluation of new cancer therapies. Historically, low rates of response (5%) and comparably high rates of death from toxicities (0.5%) have contributed to debates on the ethics and orientation of these trials. With the introduction of novel targeted therapies, a contemporary estimate is needed. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports of phase I oncology trials of single-agent targeted immunomodulators, molecularly targeted therapies, and antiangiogenic agents, published between January 2015 and July 2018. Adult and pediatric trials of solid and hematological malignancies were eligible. Treatment-related adverse events (grades 3, 4, and 5) and response rates (objective, complete, and partial) were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-eight trial reports, covering 6,707 patients, were included. The rate of treatment-related deaths was 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.1), while 13.2% of patients (9.5 to 17.3) experienced a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity. The combined objective response rate was 6.4% (4.6 to 8.5). Among trials using tumor biomarkers as eligibility criteria, the objective response rate was higher (12.0% [7.3 to 17.6] compared to 4.9% [2.5 to 5.7], P value < .01). The same was true of trials focusing on a single tumor type (13.4% [8.2 to 19.4]) compared to multiple tumor types (3.8% [2.5 to 5.3], P value < .01). CONCLUSION Reduced grade 5 risk and improved benefit appears to exist in modern phase I oncology trials, particularly in trials that target single tumor types and integrate biomarkers as eligibility criteria. These findings provide information to support informed consent discussions, highlight the need for improved reporting of phase I oncology trials, and provide direction for optimizing their design.",Revisiting Risk and Benefit in Early Oncology Trials in the Era of Precision Medicine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Phase I Trials of Targeted Single-Agent Anticancer Therapies.
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian food supply chain responded to the needs of consumers by giving continuity to the supply of food products even if the Italian food system in the first phase of lockdown had to deal with the anxiety of consumers who rushed to the food stores to “clear the shelves”. The aim of this research is to provide a qualitative interpretation of Italian families’ food consumption experiences during the lockdown due to Covid-19, which lasted from 9 March 2020 to 4 May 2020. This research has examined twenty Italian families and reveals that anxiety about the exhaustion of food stocks was detected in the first weeks of the lockdown, where there were consumers queuing at supermarkets and emptying the shelves (especially of products with high shelf life such as pasta, flour, tomato sauce). In the following weeks, the awareness that in Italy the food supply chain had been able to manage the logistics well, allowing a continuous return of food supply, led to a reprise of the normal situation. However, the results of the research show that Covid-19 in rural areas has led to a “return” to the consumption of local or near local agri-food products based on the greater time available deriving from taxes by the legislator. Furthermore, the research highlights a return to self-consumption through family-run gardens. Ultimately this article highlights some resilience strategies used by families during the lockdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.",Consumers’ eating habits during the Covid-19 pandemic: Evidence of an experimental analysis in Italy
"Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused an unexpected rebound globally. The World Health Organization has listed three variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) as variants of concern. To understand the epidemiology and thereby plan appropriate safety measures, differential identification of the variants is indeed critical. Objectives: Although whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for variant identification, it is time-consuming and relatively expensive. Therefore, a rapid, easy, and cost-effective platform targeting multiple regions of the genome is required. Here, we assessed the usefulness of the Novaplex(TM) SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay kit in identifying mutations in the variants. Study design: We retrospectively examined 30 stored nasal swabs from COVID-19-positive patients tested between November 2020 and March 2021. RNA extracted from these swabs was subjected to the commercial kit and real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed. To determine the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the collected samples and deduce the consensus sequences among the identified variants, genome sequencing libraries were prepared and mapped to the reference genome. Results: Four of the tested samples were determined as variants. Of them, two harbored both H69/V70 deletion and N501Y substitution, whereas two harbored E484K substitution alone. Conclusions: The variant with E484K substitution alone (“R.1”) has been now categorized as a variant of interest in Japan. Additionally, the kit-based assay was found to be feasible, convenient, and user-friendly in identifying the abovementioned mutations with a turnaround time of only 2 hours.",Rapid and simultaneous identification of three mutations by the Novaplex(TM) SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay kit
"OBJECTIVE To describe pediatric residency program's virtual presence and opportunities for the 2021 application cycle. METHODS 202 pediatric residency programs from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) were reviewed for departmental and residency Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. These accounts, residency websites, and the Visiting Student Application Service (VSAS) were reviewed for open house opportunities and virtual sub-internships. All data was collected from October 12- 15, 2020. RESULTS 261 social media accounts were identified. 123 (61%) programs had at least one account, with 32 (16%) programs having presence on all 3 platforms. 68 (34%) programs established new accounts after March 1, 2020. Instagram appeared most utilized with 106 (52%) programs having accounts. A total of 115 virtual open house opportunities were offered with most offers on Instagram by 61 (30%) programs. Only 2 virtual sub-internships were listed on program websites, 2 on Twitter, 1 on Instagram, and 1 on Facebook. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 increased the number of social media accounts used by residency programs. Approximately one-third of all accounts were created after March 1, 2020. However, only 16% of residency programs have a presence on all three platforms, allowing for more online growth.","""Social Media Changes in Pediatric Residency Programs During COVID-19 Pandemic""."
"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. S protein is the key viral protein for associating with ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. There are many kinds of post-translational modifications in S protein. The mechanism of palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S remains to be elucidated. In our current study, we characterized the palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S. Both the C15 and cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 S were palmitoylated. Fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 and zinc finger DHHC domain-containing palmitoyltransferase (ZDHHC) inhibitor 2-BP reduced the palmitoylation of S. Interestingly, palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S was not required for plasma membrane targeting of S, but was critical for S mediated syncytia formation and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle entry. Overexpression ZDHHC2, ZDHHC3, ZDHHC4, ZDHHC5, ZDHHC8, ZDHHC9, ZDHHC11, ZDHHC14, ZDHHC16, ZDHHC19 and ZDHHC20 promoted the palmitoylation of S. Furthermore, those ZDHHCs were identified to associate with SARS-CoV-2 S.

"The purpose of this paper is to foreground the gendered crime consequences of the global pandemic and to raise questions emanating from them for the future(s) of criminology The paper reviews some of the criminological response to the pandemic offered during 2020 The global pandemic was constituted by some as providing the opportunity for a natural experiment in which criminological theories and concepts could be tested in real time and by others as an opportunity to further raise the profile of crimes more hidden from view, particularly domestic abuse For the former, domestic abuse is constituted as an exception to what might be learned from this experimental moment For the latter, gendered violence(s) are central to making sense of this moment as ongoing, mundane and ordinary features of (women?s) everyday lives This paper makes the case that the evidence relating to the gendered consequences of Covid-19, renders it no longer possible for the discipline to regard feminist informed work (largely found within the latter view above) as the stranger, outside of, or an exception to, the discipline?s central concerns It is suggested that the future(s) of criminology lie in rendering that stranger?s voice, focusing as it does on the continuities of men?s gendered violence(s) in all spheres of life, as the discipline?s central problematic",Criminological futures and gendered violence(s): Lessons from the global pandemic for criminology
"This study explored patterns of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm in the UK during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the COVID-19 Social Study (n=44 775), a non-probability sample weighted to population proportions. The reported frequency of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm was higher among women, Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, unemployment, disability, chronic physical illnesses, mental disorders and COVID-19 diagnosis. Psychiatric medications were the most common type of support being used, but fewer than half of those affected were accessing formal or informal support.","Abuse, self-harm and suicidal ideation in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic"
"Translational readthrough—suppression of termination at a stop codon—is exploited in the replication cycles of several viruses and represents a potential target for antiviral intervention. In the gammaretroviruses, typified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gag and pol are in the same reading frame, separated by a UAG stop codon, and termination codon readthrough is required for expression of the viral Gag-Pol fusion protein. Here, we investigated the effect on MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency. We began by manipulating the readthrough signal in the context of an infectious viral clone to generate a series of MuLV variants in which readthrough was stimulated or reduced. In carefully controlled infectivity assays, it was found that reducing the MuLV readthrough efficiency only 4-fold led to a marked defect and that a 10-fold reduction essentially abolished replication. However, up to an ∼8.5-fold stimulation of readthrough (up to 60% readthrough) was well tolerated by the virus. These high levels of readthrough were achieved using a two-plasmid system, with Gag and Gag-Pol expressed from separate infectious clones. We also modulated readthrough by silencing expression of eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) or by introducing aminoglycosides into the cells. The data obtained indicate that gammaretroviruses tolerate a substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis but are very sensitive to a reduction in levels of this polyprotein. Thus, as is also the case for ribosomal frameshifting, antiviral therapies targeting readthrough with inhibitory agents are likely to be the most beneficial. IMPORTANCE Many pathogenic RNA viruses and retroviruses use ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough to regulate expression of their replicase enzymes. These translational “recoding” processes are potential targets for antiviral intervention, but we have only a limited understanding of the consequences to virus replication of modulating the efficiency of recoding, particularly for those viruses employing readthrough. In this paper, we describe the first systematic analysis of the effect of increasing or decreasing readthrough efficiency on virus replication using the gammaretrovirus MuLV as a model system. We find unexpectedly that MuLV replication is only slightly inhibited by substantial increases in readthrough frequency, but as with other viruses that use recoding strategies, replication is quite sensitive to even modest reductions. These studies provide insights into both the readthrough process and MuLV replication and have implications for the selection of antivirals against gammaretroviruses.",Modulation of Stop Codon Read-Through Efficiency and Its Effect on the Replication of Murine Leukemia Virus
"(1) Background: Until now, several reports about pregnant women with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been published. However, there are no comprehensive systematic reviews collecting all case series studies on data regarding adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially association with treatment modalities. (2) Objective: We aimed to synthesize the most up-to-date and relevant available evidence on the outcomes of pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed infection with COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, Google scholar, and Embase were explored for studies and papers regarding pregnant women with COVID-19, including obstetrical, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes and complications published from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. Systematic review and search of the published literature was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). (4) Results: In total, 11 case series studies comprising 104 pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in our review. Fever (58.6%) and cough (30.7%) were the most common symptoms. Other symptoms included dyspnea (14.4%), chest discomfort (3.9%), sputum production (1.0%), sore throat (2.9%), and nasal obstruction (1.0%). Fifty-two patients (50.0%) eventually demonstrated abnormal chest CT, and of those with ground glass opacity (GGO), 23 (22.1%) were bilateral and 10 (9.6%) were unilateral. The most common treatment for COVID-19 was administration of antibiotics (25.9%) followed by antivirals (17.3%). Cesarean section was the mode of delivery for half of the women (50.0%), although no information was available for 28.8% of the cases. Regarding obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, fetal distress (13.5%), pre-labor rupture of membranes (9.6%), prematurity (8.7%), fetal death (4.8%), and abortion (2.9%) were reported. There are no positive results of neonatal infection by RT-PCR. (5) Conclusions: Although we have found that pregnancy with COVID-19 has significantly higher maternal mortality ratio compared to that of pregnancy without the disease, the evidence is too weak to state that COVID-19 results in poorer maternal outcome due to multiple factors. The number of COVID-19 pregnancy outcomes was not large enough to draw a conclusion and long-term outcomes are yet to be determined as the pandemic is still unfolding. Active and intensive follow-up is needed in order to provide robust data for future studies.",COVID-19 and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome: A Systematic Review of 104 Cases

"A COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus, and effective vaccines are going to be available in the near future. It is urgent to estimate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and their value to individuals, in order to develop an effective public vaccination strategy. Based on a survey of 1,188 randomly selected respondents in China, we analyzed Chinese consumers’ willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and their willingness to pay for it. We find that 79.41% of the respondents are willing to get vaccinated in China, and the average amount that they’re willing to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine shot is 130.45 yuan. However, though the elderly are at higher risk of infection and the disease could be fatal for them, they are less willing to get the vaccine and not willing to pay as much for the shot. Subsidies and health communication concerning COVID-19 vaccines should be provided in order to expand vaccination coverage.",Chinese consumers’ willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay for it
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric ocular neoplasm. Multimodality treatment approaches are commonplace, and selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery has emerged as a safe and effective treatment in selected patients. Minimizing radiation dose in this highly radiosensitive patient cohort is critical. We explore which procedural factors affect the radiation dose in a single-center cohort of children managed in the UK National Retinoblastoma Service. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 177 selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery procedures in 48 patients with retinoblastoma (2013-2017). Medical records, angiographic imaging, and radiation dosimetry data (including total fluoroscopic screening time, skin dose, and dose-area product) were reviewed. RESULTS The mean fluoroscopic time was 13.5 ± 13 minutes, the mean dose-area product was 11.7 ± 9.7 Gy.cm2, and the mean total skin dose was 260.9 ± 211.6 mGy. One hundred sixty-three of 177 procedures (92.1%) were technically successful. In 14 (7.9%), the initial attempt was unsuccessful (successful in 13/14 re-attempts). Screening time and radiation dose were associated with drug-delivery microcatheter location and patient age; screening time was associated with treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS In selective ophthalmic artery chemosurgery, a microcatheter tip position in the proximal or ostial ophthalmic artery and patient age 2 years or younger were associated with reduced fluoroscopic screening time and radiation dose; treatment beyond the first cycle was associated with reduced fluoroscopic screening time.",Determinants of Radiation Dose in Selective Ophthalmic Artery Chemosurgery for Retinoblastoma.

"Transplantation of differentiated neurons derived from either human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is an emerging therapeutic strategy for various neurodegenerative diseases. One important aspect of transplantation is the accessibility to track and control the activity of the stem cells-derived neurons post-transplantation. Recently, the characteristics of organic nanoparticles (NPs) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have emerged as efficient cell labeling reagents, where positive outcomes were observed in long-term cancer cell tracing in vivo. In the current study, we designed, synthesized, and analyzed the biocompatibility of AIE-NPs in cultured neurons such as in mouse neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and hESC-derived neurons. Our data demonstrated that AIE-NPs show high degree of penetration into cells and presented intracellular long-term retention in vitro without altering the neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and viability. Furthermore, we have tracked AIE-NPs labeled neuronal grafts in mouse brain striatum in various time points post-transplantation. We demonstrated prolonged cellular retention of AIE-NPs labeled neuronal grafts 1 month post-transplantation in mouse brain striatum. Lastly, we have shown activation of brain microglia in response to AIE-NPs labeled grafts. Together, these findings highlight the potential application of AIE-NPs in neuronal transplantation.",Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) nanoparticles labeled human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived neurons for transplantation.
"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infected over 3300 healthcare workers in early 2020 in China. Little information is known about nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family members. METHODS: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological characteristics from 25 healthcare workers with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5â days, the mean±sd clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.2±3.2â days, and the median virus shedding time was 18.5â days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they have symptoms, in both hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas. Besides this, healthcare workers should be alert during the epidemic and self-quarantine if self-suspected of infection.","Nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China"
"PURPOSE To describe a case of sudden visual loss from acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) as the presenting manifestation of active Covid-19 infection. CASE REPORT During the quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 70-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of a paracentral scotoma of the left eye (OS) associated with diaphoresis. Four days later, the patient developed fever (38° C) followed by cough. Oral and nasal swab PCR testing was positive for COVID-19. Visual acuity in the day of presentation was 20/20 in OD and 20/100 in OS. Multimodal retinal imaging was unremarkable in OD but cross-sectional OCT displayed focal hyperreflectivity at the level of the outer nuclear layer associated with disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ). The corresponding en face OCT revealed an inferonasal hyperreflective parafoveal lesion. At 1 month of follow-up, tracked OCT of the macula showed resolution of the hyperreflective signal, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and near-complete recovery of EZ integrity. CONCLUSION Patients with Covid-19 may rarely present with signs and symptoms of ocular disease. This case report describes a case of sudden visual loss caused by AMN as the presenting manifestation of active Covid-19 infection.",Acute macular neuroretinopathy as the presenting manifestation of COVID-19 infection.
"l-Ribose, a starting material for the synthesis of l-nucleoside, has attracted lots of attention since l-nucleoside is responsible for the antiviral activities of the racemic mixtures of nucleoside enantiomers. In this study, the l-ribulose-producing Candida tropicalis strain was engineered for the conversion of l-arabinose to l-ribose. For the construction of a uracil auxotroph, the URA3 gene was excised by homologous recombination. The expression cassette of codon-optimized l-ribose isomerase gene from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus DL-28 under the control of the GAPDH promoter was integrated to the uracil auxotroph. The resulting strain, K1 CoSTP2 LsaAraA AcLRI, was cultivated with the glucose/l-arabinose mixture. At 45.5 h of fermentation, 6.0 g/L of l-ribose and 3.2 g/L of l-ribulose were produced from 30 g/L of l-arabinose. The proportion between l-ribose and l-ribulose was approximately 2:1 and the conversion yield of l-arabinose to l-ribose was about 20% (w/w). The l-ribose-producing yeast strain was successfully constructed for the first time and could convert l-arabinose to l-ribose in one-pot fermentation using the mixture of glucose and l-arabinose.

"Brain ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) is one of the most severe clinical manifestations of ischemic stroke, placing a significant burden on both individuals and society. The only FDA-approved clinical treatment for ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which rapidly restores cerebral blood flow but can have severe side effects. The complex pathological process of brain I/R has been well-established in the past few years, including energy metabolism disorders, cellular acidosis, doubling of the synthesis or release of excitotoxic amino acids, intracellular calcium homeostasis, free radical production, and activation of apoptotic genes. Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that NO may be strongly related to brain I/R and involved in complex pathological processes. This review focuses on the role of endogenous NO in pathological processes in brain I/R, including neuronal cell death and blood brain barrier disruption, to explore how NO impacts specific signaling cascades and contributes to brain I/R injury. Moreover, NO can rapidly react with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite, which may also mediate brain I/R injury, which is discussed here. Finally, we reveal several therapeutic approaches strongly associated with NO and discuss their potential as a clinical treatment for ischemic stroke.",Roles of Nitric Oxide in Brain Ischemia and Reperfusion
"BackgroundSeverity of radiographic abnormalities on chest X-ray (CXR) in patients with COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with worse outcomes, but studies are limited by different scoring systems, sample size, patient age and study duration. Data regarding the longitudinal evolution of radiographic abnormalities and its association with outcomes is scarce. We sought to evaluate these questions using a well-validated scoring system (the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema [RALE] score) using data over 6 months from a large, multi-hospital healthcare system. MethodsWe collected clinical and demographic data and quantified radiographic edema on CXRs obtained in the emergency department (ED) as well as on days 1-2 and 3-5 (in those admitted) in patients with a nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR visiting the ED for COVID-19-related complaints between March and September 2020. We examined the association of baseline and longitudinal evolution of radiographic edema with severity of hypoxemia and clinical outcomes. Results870 patients were included (median age 53.6, 50.8% female). Inter-rate agreement for RALE scores was excellent (ICC = 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 - 0.87, p < 0.0001). RALE scores correlated with hypoxemia as quantified by SpO2-FiO2 ratio (r = -0.42, p < 0.001). Admitted patients had higher RALE scores than those discharged (6 [2, 11] vs 0 [0, 3], p < 0.001). An increase of RALE score of 4 or more was associated with worse 30-day survival (p < 0.01). Larger increases in the RALE score were associated with worse survival. ConclusionsThe RALE score is reproducible and easily implementable in adult patients presenting to the ED with COVID-19. Its association with physiologic parameters and outcomes at baseline and longitudinally makes it a readily available tool for prognostication and early ICU triage, particularly in patients with worsening radiographic edema.",Chest X-ray Severity and its Association with Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Presenting to the Emergency Department

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines were launched after granting them ‘emergency use authorization’ approval. Beyond the clinical trial, there was very limited data on the side effects following vaccination This is a longitudinal study among health care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital. Information was also collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire which included their demographic details, first dose and second dose. Post-vaccination follow-up was done at the centre which was then followed up by telephonic monitoring after 48 hours. In the present study 1,034 (65.6%) health care workers (HCWs) did not report any serious reactions/symptoms. Pain and tenderness were the most commonly reported side-effects in more than half. The severity of the symptoms following the second dose of vaccine was compared with the first dose and it was found that the majority 653 (41.4%) had reported no symptoms/reactions following both doses of vaccine.

"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids use in severe COVID-19 improves survival; however, the optimal dose is not established. We aim to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 receiving high-dose corticosteroids (HDC) versus low-dose corticosteroids (LDC). METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study conducted at a large, quaternary care center in Michigan. A corticosteroid dose change was implemented in the standardized institutional treatment protocol on 17 November 2020. All patients admitted with severe COVID-19 that received corticosteroids were included. Consecutive patients in the HDC group (1 September to 15 November 2020) were compared to the LDC group (30 November 2020 to 20 January 2021). HDC was defined as methylprednisolone 80 mg daily in two divided doses and LDC was defined as methylprednisolone 32-40 mg daily in two divided doses. The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included progression to mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge on supplemental oxygen, and corticosteroid-associated adverse events. RESULTS: Four-hundred and seventy patients were included; 218 (46%) and 252 (54%) in the HDC and LDC groups, respectively. No difference was observed in 28-day mortality (14.5% vs 13.5%, p=0.712). This finding remained intact when controlling for additional variables (OR 0.947, [CI 0.515-1.742], p=0.861). Median hospital LOS was 6 and 5 days in the HDC and LDC groups, respectively (p<0.001). No differences were noted in any of the other secondary outcomes.

"Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a powerful innovative gene amplification technique emerging as a simple rapid diagnostic tool for early detection and identification of microbial diseases. The whole procedure is very simple and rapid wherein the amplification can be completed in less than 1 h under isothermal conditions employing a set of six specially designed primers spanning eight distinct sequences of a target gene, by incubating all the reagents in a single tube. Gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real‐time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. Gene copy number can also be quantified with the help of a standard curve generated from different concentrations of gene copy number plotted against time of positivity with the help of a real‐time turbidimeter. Alternatively, gene amplification can be visualised by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a colour change when SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye, is employed. LAMP does not require a thermal cycler and can be performed simply with a heating block and/or water bath. Considering the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation and easy detection, LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel.

"INTRODUCTION: Revisional bariatric surgery is being increasingly performed and is associated with higher operative risks. Optimal techniques to minimize complications remain controversial. Here, we report a retrospective review of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant User Files (PUF) database, comparing outcomes between revision RBS and LBS. METHODS: The 2015 and 2016 MBSAQIP PUF database was retrospectively reviewed. Revision cases were identified using the Revision/Conversion Flag. Selected cases were further stratified by surgical approach. Subgroup analysis of sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass cases was performed. Case–controlled matching (1:1) was performed of the RBS and LBS cohorts, including gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts separately. Cases and controls were match by demographics, ASA classification, and preoperative comorbidities. RESULTS: 26,404 revision cases were identified (93.3% LBS, 6.7% RBS). 85.6% were female and 67% white. Mean age and BMI were 48 years and 40.9 kg/m(2). 1144 matched RBS and LBS cases were identified. RBS was associated with longer operative duration (p < 0.0001), LOS (p = 0.0002) and a higher rate of ICU admissions (1.3% vs 0.5%, p = 0.05). Aggregate bleeding and leak rates were higher in the RBS cohort. In both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts, the robotic-assisted surgery remain associated with longer operative duration (p < 0.0001). In gastric bypass, rates of aggregate leak and bleeding were higher with robotic surgery, while transfusion was higher with laparoscopy. For sleeve gastrectomy cases, reoperation, readmission, intervention, sepsis, organ space SSI, and transfusion were higher with robotic surgery. CONCLUSION: In this matched cohort analysis of revision bariatric surgery, both approaches were overall safe. RBS was associated with longer operative duration and higher rates of some complications. Complications were higher in the robotic sleeve cohort. Robotic is likely less cost-effective with no clear patient safety benefit, particularly for sleeve gastrectomy cases.","Outcomes in conventional laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted revisional bariatric surgery: a retrospective, case–controlled study of the MBSAQIP database"
"AIM: To compare intraluminal stenting and external ligation of Ahmed glaucoma valves (AGV) for refractory glaucoma management and postoperative hypotony prevention. METHODS: This randomized prospective blind study included 30 eyes of 25 patients (age range: 44-56y) with refractory glaucoma. This study was conducted from September 2018 to January 2020. The study included two groups, AGV with intraluminal stenting group (n=15 eyes) and AGV with external ligation group (n=15 eyes). Follow-up period was one year postoperatively. The primary outcome was intraocular pressure (IOP) and its association with the number of postoperative glaucoma medications. IOP≤21 mm Hg without medications indicated complete success while IOP≤21 mm Hg with medications indicated qualified success; and IOP<6 mm Hg was defined as hypotony. RESULTS: After a year of follow-up, IOP was significantly reduced in the intraluminal stenting group than in the external ligation group (11.67±0.89 vs 14.2±4.0 mm Hg, respectively, P=0.024). Postoperative hypotony was more common in the external ligation group (2 cases, 13.33%) than in the intraluminal stenting group (1 case, 6.67%). CONCLUSION: Application of intraluminal stenting or external ligation during AGV surgery usually prevents postoperative hypotony (transient and persistent) that occurs in conventional AGV surgery.",Intraluminal stenting versus external ligation of Ahmed glaucoma valve in prevention of postoperative hypotony

Using an established computer-based platform, family nurse practitioner, adult gerontology clinical nurse specialist, and adult gerontology acute care nurse practitioner students participated in simulation experiences with complex patients and interprofessional health care teams. This experience was purposefully designed to align with the International Nursing Association of Clinical Simulation Learning Standards of Best Practice. After each simulation, students completed a worksheet and participated in an intraprofessional debriefing session. A survey was administered to solicit student feedback about the experience.",Virtual Simulation for Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Students: Adapting to Shortage of Clinicals
"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the viability and effectiveness of nonprofit organizations compelling them to make tough choices. Evidence suggests that different wordings or message settings may affect people’s decisions when presenting equivalent outcome information with positive or negative framing. Nevertheless, there have been few attempts to assess how procedural fairness and framing effects shape nonprofit managers’ reactions to job layoffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a survey experiment, we explore whether framing effects—by affecting perceived outcome favorability—and procedural fairness interact to influence nonprofit managers’ trust and support for their organizations. The findings of this 2 × 2 between-participants experimental design indicated that only when procedural fairness was relatively low did nonprofit managers react more favorably in the positive frame (keep) than in the negative frame (layoff) condition. This study adds to our understanding of how the pandemic impacts nonprofit managers, including their commitment to continue working in the sector, and has practical implications for nonprofit organizations that manage resilience in a crisis.","Framing Effects, Procedural Fairness, and the Nonprofit Managers’ Reactions to Job Layoffs in Response to the Economic Shock of the COVID-19 Crisis"

"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a disease with a mortality of 9.56%. Although SARS is etiologically linked to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and functional cell receptor has been identified, the pathogenesis of the virus infection is largely unclear. METHODS The clinical specimens were processed and analyzed using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in-house. Further investigations of target antigen included reviews of phage display technique, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, protein expression and purification, Western blotting validation, serological and immunohistochemical staining in postmortem tissue. RESULTS A type of medium or low titer anti-lung tissue antibodies were found in the sera of SARS patients at the early stage of the disease. Human long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) gene endonuclease (EN) domain protein was one of the target autoantigens and it was aberrantly expressed in the lung tissue of SARS patients. Anti-EN antibody was positive in the sera of 40.9% of SARS patients. CONCLUSIONS Human LINE1 endonuclease domain was identified as a putative target of SARS-associated autoantibodies, which were presented in the serum of SARS patients and may be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS.",Human LINE1 endonuclease domain as a putative target of SARS-associated autoantibodies involved in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
"Loneliness is a growing public health problem that threatens physical and mental health to a large extent. Compelling evidence has shown that premature parental death is strongly associated with many mental health disorders in adulthood, but whether it increases the risk of loneliness remains unclear. In this large community-based study, we included 32,682 adult participants (20–93 years old) from Southwest China and used the three-item short version of University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale to identify participants with loneliness. A total of 1,975 participants reported loneliness, which resulted in a loneliness prevalence of 6.0% in Southwest China. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between early parental death and loneliness after adjusting for age, gender, education level, marital status, smoking and drinking status, living status, and chronic diseases. We found that early parental death was significantly associated with loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–1.42]. A Sensitivity analysis excluding those with mental health disorders (796 participants) yielded similar results (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06–1.49). We also found that being younger, single, divorced, or widowed, and more educated; living alone; and having chronic disorders were associated with loneliness. We conclude that childhood parental death is associated with loneliness in adulthood, suggesting the need for early intervention in affected children to prevent long-term adverse neuropsychiatric effects.",Association Between Early Parental Death and Loneliness in Adulthood: A Community-Based Study in Southwest China

"Parasitic diseases are still a huge problem for mankind. They are becoming the main cause of chronic diseases in the world. Migration of the population, pollution of the natural environment, and climate changes cause the rapid spread of diseases. Additionally, a growing resistance of parasites to drugs is observed. Many research groups are looking for effective antiparasitic drugs with low side effects. In this work, we present the current trends in the search for antiparasitic drugs. We report known drugs used in other disease entities with proven antiparasitic activity and research on new chemical structures that may be potential drugs in parasitic diseases. The described investigations of antiparasitic compounds can be helpful for further drug development.",The Current Directions of Searching for Antiparasitic Drugs

"The purpose of this paper is to examine biopharma innovation ecosystems (IEs) through the lenses of a stakeholder model. In doing so, this work aims to answer the following research question: which stakeholders are required in an IE within biopharma industry and what are their main roles in the IE value creation. The research strategy was designed according to the grounded theory methodology. By applying this methodology, data were collected through verbatim interviews with several stakeholders. Both data collection and data analysis phases were carried out concurrently up to saturation where all data were identified and their consistency across the many forms was reached. The thesis of the paper intends to prove that biopharma IEs consist of a multilevel and longitudinal set of key stakeholders. Furthermore, by investigating the Lombardy case study, it explains the role of each stakeholder with regards to the comparative advantages required in the engagement with the IE. In addition, arising from a holistic view of the biopharma IEs, this research traces the biopharma IE dynamics through the analysis of the IE’s driving forces. This paper represents one of the first heuristic attempts to analyze in-depth biopharma IE from a holistic perspective. The paper findings can be considered to be an impactful extension to biopharma IEs world-wide. This broader scope is well supported by expert interviews as a central part of the methodology and by the investigated scientific literature.",Biopharmaceutical innovation ecosystems: a stakeholder model and the case of Lombardy
"Background The objective of this study was to investigate a case of a permanently (suprapubic) catheterized woman with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The patient had suffered from recurrent catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) since 2009, despite several prevention approaches and attempts. In 2013, the patient's catheter was substituted for the BIP Foley Catheter, coated with a noble metal alloy (NMA) of gold, silver, and palladium. Method This is a retrospective-prospective clinical case study covering 4 years history for the control catheters and up to 2.5 years for the anti-infective BIP Foley Catheter. CAUTI incidences, symptoms, antibiotics, catheter performance, and comfort were evaluated. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines were measured pre- and post-substitution to BIP Foley Catheter in urine of the case and of four other permanently catheterized patients. In addition, the levels of noble metals were assessed in urine of the case subject during use of the BIP Foley Catheter. Results While using control catheters, the patient experienced symptomatic CAUTIs requiring antibiotics almost every month for 4 years. After 1 month with the BIP Foley Catheter, the symptoms disappeared, and the patient remained free of symptomatic CAUTIs and antibiotic treatment for the following 2.5 years, despite bacteriuria. The patient was satisfied with the comfort during insertion, use, and removal of the BIP Foley Catheter. Urinary levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) decreased towards normal levels post catheter type substitution. Traces of noble metals detected in a few urine samples were ⩽4% of the permitted daily exposure. The levels of the noble metals gold, silver, and palladium remaining on the BIP Foley Catheter after use were the same as for unused catheters. Conclusion Long-term use of a NMA-coated catheter was associated with cessation of frequent CAUTIs. The catheter was experienced as comfortable and inflammatory markers were reduced with time. The coating was stable, with no significant metal release into urine and is therefore safe for patient use.",Long-term use of noble metal alloy coated urinary catheters reduces recurrent CAUTI and decreases proinflammatory markers.
"AIMS: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses significant challenges to many groups within societies, and especially for people with chronic health conditions. It is, however, unknown whether and how the pandemic has thus far affected the physical and mental health of patient populations. Therefore, we investigated how the pandemic affected the lives of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD), compared pre- and peri-pandemic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and a patient-reported experience measure (PREM), and investigated whether having had COVID-19 impacted pre-/peri-pandemic differences of the PROMs and PREM. METHODS AND RESULTS: As part of the ongoing APPROACH-IS II project, we longitudinally surveyed 716 adults with CHD from Belgium, Norway, and South Korea. Pre-pandemic measures were administered from August 2019 to February 2020 and the peri-pandemic surveys were completed September 2020–April 2021. The majority of patients indicated that their social lives (80%), mental health (58%), and professional lives/education (51%) were negatively impacted by the pandemic. Patients felt worried (65%), were afraid (55%), reported the pandemic felt ‘close’ to them (53%), and were stressed (52%). However, differences between pre- and peri-pandemic scores on the PROMs and PREM were negligibly small (Cohen’s d < 0.20). Across measures, 5.8–15.8% of patients demonstrated changes (improved or worsened scores) that exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. There were no difference-in-differences for PROMs and PREM between patients who did vs. did not have COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been disruptive in many ways, pre- to peri-pandemic changes in PROMs and PREM of adults with CHD were negligibly small.","The COVID-19 pandemic as experienced by adults with congenital heart disease from Belgium, Norway, and South Korea: impact on life domains, patient-reported outcomes, and experiences with care"
