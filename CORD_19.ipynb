The results of the study show that the tourism sector has been greatly affected by the pandemic, both directly, with a drastic reduction in the number of visitors directly departing from the pandemic, but above all by reducing the number of flights by decision, both from issuing countries and later from Mozambique. However, by reducing, to a minimum the possibilities of international and national movement, the tourist enterprises (accommodation and restaurants) see their main source of income not appear.

Both during and after SAME splenic lymphocytes from these animals could be restimulated in vitro to proliferate in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP). MBP-specific class II MHC-restricted T cell lines were isolated from this cell population. They were shown to exhibit no cross-reactivity with measles virus and to induce experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in naive syngeneic recipients following adoptive transfer. The clinical and histopathological signs of this T cell-mediated disease were identical to that seen in classical T cell-mediated EAE. A humoral immune response to MBP was only detected in a limited number of those rats with SAME.

Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have proven to be highly effective against severe COVID-19 disease, the decrease in vaccine efficacy against emerged Beta and Delta variants emphasizes the need for constant monitoring of new virus lineages and studies on the persistence of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. To analyze the dynamics of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses, we followed 52 health care workers in Finland for 6 months after receiving two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine with a 3-week interval. We demonstrate that, although anti-S1 antibody levels decrease 2.3-fold compared to peak antibody levels, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist for months after BNT162b2 vaccination. Variants D614G, Alpha, and Eta are neutralized by sera of 100% of vaccinees, whereas neutralization of Delta is 3.8-fold reduced and neutralization of Beta is 5.8-fold reduced compared to D614G. Despite this reduction, 85% of sera collected 6 months postvaccination neutralizes Delta variant. IMPORTANCE A decrease in vaccine efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants has increased the importance of assessing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. Our data show that after 6 months post two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, antibody levels decrease yet remain detectable and capable of neutralizing emerging variants. By monitoring the vaccine-induced antibody responses, vaccination strategies and administration of booster doses can be optimized.\\ntitle: Vaccine-Induced Antibody Responses against SARS-CoV-2 Variants-Of-Concern Six Months after the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: OBJECTIVES To summarize adaptations due to COVID-19 for VA Problem Solving Training (PST) for clinicians serving medically complex patients and to compare patient mental health outcomes in the year before (2019) and during COVID-19 (2020). METHODS Clinicians attended a multi-day workshop and up to 6 months of small-group consultation for two training cases. In 2019 and 2020, 122 Veteran patients completed baseline and posttreatment measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item), and negative problem-solving beliefs (Negative Problem Orientation Questionnaire). Qualitative data were collected on clinician's pandemic-related treatment implementation challenges. RESULTS Program adaptations during COVID-19 addressed challenges due to delivering treatment by telephone, video, or in person; Veteran patient recruitment barriers; and privacy issues for telephone and video. Veterans in both pre-pandemic and COVID-19 cohorts had significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and negative problem-solving beliefs, with no significant differences in the amount of improvement between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Flexibilities afforded to clinicians delivering the PST training program during the pandemic addressed key obstacles and barriers to recruitment, and implementation did not diminish the effectiveness of the intervention.

By the end of the fourth wave in October 2021, Malaysia has among the highest death toll in Asia, cumulative incidence of confirmed cases has reached 7.0% (>30% in Klang Valley). However it remains uncertain what is the true proportion of the population infected. We conducted a sero-survey on 1078 workers from 17 worksites in Klang Valley and Perak between July and September 2021. We tested them for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using Ecotest, a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The ability of antibody testing to detect prior infection depends on the assay and sero-reversion. We therefore adjusted the prevalence estimates to correct for potential misclassification bias due to the use of LFIA and sero-reversion using test sensitivity and specificity results estimated from an independent validation study. The mean age of the workers was 32 years, 89% were male and migrant workers comprised 81% of all subjects, 59% the subjects were from Klang valley. 33% of workers had prior RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 infections. We estimated 82.2 percent of workers had been infected by Covid-19 by July-September 2021. Prevalence was 99.9% among migrant workers and 12.1% among local workers. Klang Valley, the most industrialized region in Malaysia where most migrant workers are found, had 100% prevalence, giving an infection-to-case ratio (ICF) of [~]3.

For breastfeeding to succeed, women must have access to appropriate support and guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restriction measures and lockdown to reduce community spread of the disease have negatively impacted breastfeeding support from health services and thus, in mothers' breastfeeding experiences. Objective: The present study aims at evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breastfeeding consultations in LactApp (a mobile application [app] for m-Health focused on breastfeeding support, www.lactapp.com) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted an observational, descriptive, and retrospective study with LactApp data recorded between July 2018 and March 2021, including 9,151,456 queries classified in 48 topics among 137,327 active users. We used the Interrupted time series model to evaluate the increase of the number of queries consulted and active users due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wilcoxon test was used to study the increase of certain topics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: LactApp active users increased by 12,092 users (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 outbreak and confinement and queries consulted in LactApp also significantly increased by 10,899 queries per month after the pandemic outbreak. The breastfeeding topics that significantly increased are those related to growth spurts, breastfeeding stages, breastfeeding technique, breast pain and mastitis, problems with infants not gaining weight correctly, hypogalactia, increased milk demand, and relactation. These findings are important to understand the potential of online tools when face-to-face professional support is unavailable. Conclusions: Critical issues in breastfeeding establishment were highly consulted and significantly increased in the app during the pandemic. We believe that LactApp was a useful tool for breastfeeding support when women could not obtain appropriate support elsewhere. LactApp might be considered a powerful tool to identify critical issues of breastfeeding and trends in an automatized manner.\\ntitle: Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Breastfeeding Consultations on LactApp, an m-Health Solution for Breastfeeding Support\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 7}), Document(page_content='abstract: Two new luminophore polymorphs of 4-bromo-7-(4-nonylphenyl) benzo[c] [1,2,5] thiadiazole (1α and 1β) exhibiting different color emission which switch into each other in response to shear force and solvent vapors are presented and their X-ray structure determined. Supramolecular Organic Framework Topology (SOFT) studies, on the two polymor-phic structures led us to conclude that the mechanochromic phase transformation can be explained on the base of modifications in their respective topological nets: mab and pcu for 1α and 1β respectively as a result of the breaking and restoration of a number of weak supramolecular interactions.

SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Eight adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS participated in telephone or video call interviews between June and July 2020. RESULTS: Participants were aware that having MS made them more vulnerable to contracting COVID‐19. In some cases, usual care was postponed or not sought. Some circumstances warranted the risk of a face‐to‐face consultation. Benefits of telehealth consultations included improved access, convenience and being contact‐free. In comparison with video consultations, those via telephone were considered less personal and limited capacity to read body language, and for physical examination.

Pathogens exploit CD209L family proteins to promote infection and evade the immune recognition system. CD209L and CD209 are widely expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target organs and can contribute to infection and pathogenesis. CD209L family receptors are highly susceptible to alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism, which may influence virus tropism and transmission in vivo. The carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) and the neck/repeat region represent the key features of CD209L family proteins that are also central to facilitating cellular ligand interactions and pathogen recognition. While, the neck/repeat region is involved in oligomeric dimerization, the CRD recognizes the mannose containing structures present on specific glycoproteins such as those found on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Age, gender, marital status, educational qualifications, health care worker status and state of residence were the demographic details (six items) collected. The seven-item FCV-19S was used to assess fear regarding COVID-19 on a five-point Likert scale. The mean score for the responses was calculated and compared based on demographic variables. A comparison of low and high levels of fear and a multiple logistic regression analysis of levels of fear with demographic variables were conducted. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study population comprised 45.6% (683) males and 54.4% (816) females, with approximately 68% belonging to the age group of 20-40 years.

Previous research during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 established an increase of patient aggression in psychiatric facilities. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Despite expected worsening of mental health, our hospital observed reductions in aggressive behaviour among inpatients and subsequent use of coercive interventions by staff in the months following Covid-19 pandemic restrictions being implemented. The downward trend in incidents observed during the pandemic has suggested that aggression in mental health hospitals may be more situation-specific and less so a factor of mental illness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: We believe that the reduction in aggressive behaviour observed during the pandemic is related to changes in our organization that occurred in response to concerns about patient well-being; our co-design approach shifted trust, choice and power. Therefore, practices that support these constructs are needed to maintain the outcomes we experienced. Rather than return to normal in the wake of the pandemic, we are strongly encouraged to sustain the changes we made and continue to find better ways to support and work with the individuals who rely on or use our services. ABSTRACT: The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the operation of health care such that many services were put on hold as patients were triaged differently, people delayed seeking care, and transition to virtual care was enacted, including in psychiatric facilities. Most of the media dialogue has been negative; however, there have been some silver linings observed. Coinciding with the pandemic has been a reduction in aggressive incidents at our psychiatric hospital, along with the decreased need to use restraints and seclusion to manage behaviour. In this paper, we are taking stock of the changes that have occurred in response to the pandemic in an attempt to share our learnings and offer suggestions so that health care does not necessarily return to \"normal\".\\ntitle: Silver linings: Observed reductions in aggression and use of restraints and seclusion in psychiatric inpatient care during COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 17}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Pursed-lips breathing (PLB) is a technique to attenuate small airway collapse by regulating the expiratory flow. During mandatory ventilation, flow-controlled expiration (FLEX), which mimics the expiratory flow course of PLB utilizing a digital system for measurement and control, was shown to exert lung protective effects. However, PLB requires a patient’s participation and coordinated muscular effort and FLEX requires a complex technical setup. Here, we present an adjustable flow regulator to mimic PLB and FLEX, respectively, without the need of a patient’s participation, or a complex technical device. METHODS: Our study consisted of two parts: First, in a lung model which was ventilated with standard settings (tidal volume 500 ml, respiratory rate 12 min(−1), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH(2)O), the possible reduction of the maximal expiratory flow by utilizing the flow regulator was assessed. Second, with spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers, the short-term effects of medium and strong expiratory flow reduction on airway pressure, the change of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and breathing discomfort was investigated. RESULTS: In the lung model experiments, expiratory flow could be reduced from − 899 ± 9 ml·s(−1) down to − 328 ± 25 ml·s(−1). Thereby, inspiratory variables and PEEP were unaffected. In the volunteers, the maximal expiratory flow of − 574 ± 131 ml·s(−1) under baseline conditions was reduced to − 395 ± 71 ml·s(−1) for medium flow regulation and to − 266 ± 58 ml·s(−1) for strong flow regulation, respectively (p < 0.001). Accordingly, mean airway pressure increased from 0.6 ± 0.1 cmH(2)O to 2.9 ± 0.4 cmH(2)O with medium flow regulation and to 5.4 ± 2.4 cmH(2)O with strong flow regulation, respectively (p < 0.001). The EELV increased from baseline by 31 ± 458 ml for medium flow regulation and 320 ± 681 ml for strong flow regulation (p = 0.033). The participants rated breathing with the flow regulator as moderately uncomfortable, but none rated breathing with the flow regulator as intolerable. CONCLUSIONS: The flow regulator represents an adjustable device for application of a self-regulated expiratory resistive load, representing an alternative for PLB and FLEX. Future applications in spontaneously breathing patients and patients with mandatory ventilation alike may reveal potential benefits.

Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Uganda's communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants' characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer. Factors associated with experiencing violence or discrimination were: being male (AOR = 1.60 CI:1.10-2.33), having attended work physically for more than 3 days in the past week (AOR = 1.52 CI:1.03-2.23), and inability to access social or essential health services since the epidemic started (AOR = 3.10 CI:2.14-4.50). CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Ugandan residents experienced violence and/or discrimination during the COVID-19 lockdown, mostly perpetrated by law enforcement officers. We recommend mitigation of the collateral impact of lockdowns with interventions that focus on improving policing quality, ensuring continuity of essential services, and strengthening support systems for vulnerable groups including males.\\ntitle: Violence and discrimination among Ugandan residents during the COVID-19 lockdown\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 24}), Document(page_content='abstract: This study aimed to evaluate changes in dietary and lifestyle habits during the period of confinement due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ibero-American countries. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted with 6,325 participants of both genders (68% women), over 18 years of age and from five countries: Brazil (N = 2,171), Argentina (N = 1,111), Peru (N = 1,174), Mexico (N = 686), and Spain (N = 1,183). Data were collected during the year 2020, between April 01 and June 30 in Spain and between July 13 and September 26, in the other countries studied using a self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of sociodemographic, employment, physical activity, health status, and dietary habits changes. Most participants (61.6%), mainly those from Spain, remained constant, without improving or worsening their pattern of food consumption. Among those who changed, a pattern of better eating choices prevailed (22.7%) in comparison with those who changed toward less healthy choices (15.7%). Argentina and Brazil showed the highest proportion of changes toward a healthier pattern of food consumption. Peruvians and Mexicans were less likely to make healthy changes in food consumption (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.4–0.6 and OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.4–0.8, respectively), when compared to Argentinians. Most respondents did not change their pattern of meal consumption, but those who did reduced their consumption of main meals and increased intake of small meals and snacks. Although most participants affirmed to be doing physical activity at home, about one-half reported perception of weight gain. Individuals with alterations in sleep pattern (either by increasing or decreasing sleep time) were more likely to change their diets to a healthier pattern. In contrast, individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who reported feeling anxious were more likely to perform changes to a less healthy eating pattern (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.2–2.3 and OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.1–1.4, respectively). In conclusion, although most participants remained constant in their eating habits, lifestyle changes and anxiety feelings were reported. Among those who changed patterns of food consumption, healthier choices prevailed, with differences between countries. However, there were alterations in the distribution of meals, with higher consumption of snacks and small meals. These results can be used to guide policies to prevent deleterious consequences that may affect the incidence of chronic diseases.\\ntitle: Diet and Lifestyle Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ibero-American Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Spain', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 25}), Document(page_content='abstract: I use the North American Breeding Bird Survey (Sauer et al. 2017) to construct 462 population trajectories with about 50 yearly abundance estimates each.

The traditional paradigm—that the population dynamic growth rate is a function of the environment, with maximal per-capita growth at low population densities, and sub-optimal reproduction from famine at carrying capacities with strong competition for limited resources—is not supported. Selection regulation generates a new paradigm where the world is green and individuals are selected to survive and reproduce at optimal levels at population dynamic equilibria with sufficient resources.

We focused on small circulating RNAs from plasma of subjects with prodromal (pre-HD) and overt disease by a two-stage approach: an unbiased investigation by an array method and a validation study to quantify a significant small nucleolar RNA. Methods Through Affymetrix Gene-Chip-miRNA-Array we performed an exploratory study on 9 HD patients, 8 healthy subjects (HS) and 5 psychiatric patients (PP; who share drugs with HD patients, to control for iatrogenic effects). Through real time PCR we validated the results in an independent population of 24 HD patients, 15 pre-HD, 24 PP, 28 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients (added to control the disease-specificity of our finding) and 23 HS. A bioinformatic analysis was also performed to interpret our finding. Results The microarray results showed a significant signal for U13 small nucleolar RNA (SNORD13) that was increased in plasma of HD patients compared to controls (fold change, 1.54, p =0.003 HD vs. HS, and fold change 1.44 p = 0.0026 HD vs. PP). In the validation population the significant increase in HD patients was evident compared to both pre-HD and the three control groups (p<0.00001). The plasma levels of SNORD13 correlated with the status of mutant huntingtin carrier and the disease duration (respectively R=0.69; p<0.000001; R=0.49; p=0.015). Through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we showed high accuracy of plasmatic SNORD13 in discriminating HD patients from pre-HD and control groups (AUC=0.963), outperforming values reported in another study for intrathecal or plasmatic mutant huntingtin and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of overt HD. The bioinformatic analysis on SNORD13 interactome and pathway analysis showed enrichments for factors involved in nuclear functions beyond the ribosome biogenesis. Discussion We report the unprecedented finding of a potential role of small nucleolar RNAs in HD. Circulating SNORD13 seems a good biomarker for clinical purposes. It seems to be specific for HD and to peripherally report a plausible ‘tipping point’ in the pathogenic cascade at neuronal level, possibly paving the way for new therapeutic targets.\\ntitle: Circulating U13 small nucleolar RNA as a candidate biomarker for Huntington’s disease', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 27}), Document(page_content='abstract: Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectromicroscopy was used to study individual living cells of three closely-related species of the green algal genus Chlamydomonas.

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has been investigated as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy, a known effective treatment for suicidality, in the management of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, with promising findings. Yet, there are very limited data on the association of MST with suicidality directly. It is important to explore the potential of MST as a viable treatment alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for suicidality. Objective To determine the association of MST with suicidality in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants This nonrandomized controlled trial took place at a single tertiary care psychiatric facility in Canada. It followed an open-label study design with consecutive treatment cohorts. Consecutive groupings of 67 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and with baseline suicidality present were treated for up to 24 treatments. The study was run from February 2012 through June 2019. Patients were followed up for 6 months at the end of the treatment period. This post hoc secondary analysis of the trial was performed from January to November 2019. Interventions MST was delivered at 100% stimulator output over the prefrontal cortex with low (25 Hz), moderate (50 or 60 Hz), or high (100 Hz) frequency, for a maximum of 24 sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures Remission from suicidality was measured as an end point score of 0 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. A linear mixed model was used to assess the trajectory of Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores. Results A total of 67 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.3 [13.6] years; 40 women [60.0%]) received a mean (SD) of 19.5 (5.1) MST treatments. The overall number of patients achieving remission was 32 (47.8%). Sixteen patients (55.2%) receiving low-frequency MST achieved remission, as well as 12 patients (54.5%) in the moderate-frequency group, and 4 patients (25.0%) in the high-frequency group. The linear mixed model revealed an association of time with Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores (F8,293.95 = 5.73; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that MST may be an effective treatment for suicidality, and sensitivity analysis shows this may be particularly so at low and moderate frequencies. Future studies should directly compare MST with electroconvulsive therapy for treating suicidality and should evaluate MST as a treatment for suicidality across mental disorders.

Yet, much of research and counseling on career-development holds unrealistic assumptions of a makeable career. Little is understood about the role of shocks on the career path and how the interplay of individual reactions to shocks shapes careers. The purpose of this study is to provide understanding of responses to different attributes of career shocks and career shocks as antecedents to career and job change. A qualitative approach was chosen and data were obtained from 25 semi-structured interviews with a sample of mid-career individuals who had experienced shocks in their work lives. The analysis was 2-fold and aimed at unearthing of individual responses to shocks and the question of the role of shocks on changes in the career path. Firstly, the analysis of career shocks revealed a pattern of distinct agentic responses in relation to shocks of different attributes. Secondly, from the analysis of shock attributes and corresponding responses over time career changer profiles emerged which differ in regard to career change behavior and magnitude of changes in the career (e.g., major career changes into another field). A process model which depicts how post-shock careers are shaped distinctively in relation to different shock attributes and corresponding responses is presented. This study underlines the importance of understanding the unplannable in career development and shows a variety of options for individuals to develop their careers despite shocks. Limitation stems from the investigation of a sample limited to mid-career individuals. The findings provide a new conceptual lens to theorize and conduct research on career shocks and career changes and facilitate the development of coping strategies for career shocks. The originality lies in the investigation of the momentum of career shocks on career paths with detail to different attributes of career shocks and how they impact the career path.\\ntitle: From Shock to Shift–A Qualitative Analysis of Accounts in Mid-Career About Changes in the Career Path', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 31}), Document(page_content='abstract: Chemically synthesized short interfering RNA (siRNA) has ushered a new era in the application of RNA interference (RNAi) against viral genes. We have paid particular attention to respiratory viruses that wreak heavy morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinically significant ones include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) (two Paramyxoviruses), and influenza virus (an Orthomyxovirus). As the infection by these viruses is clinically restricted to the respiratory tissues, mainly the lungs, the logical route for the application of the siRNA was also the same, i.e., via the nasal route. Following the initial success of single intranasal siRNA against RSV, we now offer two new strategies: (1) second-generation siRNAs, used against the paramyxoviral RNA polymerase large subunit (L), (2) siRNA cocktail with a novel transfection reagent, used against influenza virus. Based on these results, we propose the following consensus for designing intranasal antiviral siRNAs: (a) modified 19–27 nt-long double-stranded siRNAs are functional in the lung, (b) excessive 2′-OMe and 2′-F modifications in either or both strands of these siRNAs reduce efficacy, (c) limited modifications in the sense strand are beneficial, although their precise efficacy may be position-dependent, (d) cocktail of multiple siRNAs can be highly effective against multiple viral strains and subtypes.\\ntitle: Therapy of Respiratory Viral Infections with Intranasal siRNAs', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 32}), Document(page_content='abstract: Epidemiological models usually contain a set of parameters that must be adjusted based on available observations. Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators of model parameters for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from them will vary widely, depending on the particular values employed within the range that gives a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given an epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemic curves, whose information is encapsulated in posterior predictive distributions. From these, one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this approach to the evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological curve has flattened.\\ntitle: Using posterior predictive distributions to analyse epidemic models: COVID-19 in Mexico City.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 33}), Document(page_content='abstract: To accelerate the handling of the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has issued a vaccination discourse for the people of Indonesia;as of January 20, 2021, there are more than 939.000 incidents and more than 26.000 incidents resulting in mortality.

In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly recommended for patients who require chronic anticoagulation to continue therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. To avoid regular and frequent blood tests and unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during contacts with medical personnel, direct oral anticoagulants should be strongly preferred whenever possible. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine pharmacological antithrombotic prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of VTE or in whom the diagnosis is confirmed, parenteral therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in the absence of contraindications.

To allow the public to be aware of the exposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based probability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for estimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds. The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU unit were recruited into the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one-time oral dose of 120,000 IU (two tablets of 60,000 IU each) of vitamin D (n = 20) or 8 mg of saccharide (two tablets of 4 g each) as placebo (n = 15). The main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2). RESULTS: The results indicated an improvement in the level of consciousness after 7 days in the vitamin D-treated group compared with placebo. An elevation in GCS score by 3.86 units in the vitamin D-treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin D-treated group compared with the control group (4.7 days vs. 8.2 days, p value 0.0001).

However, the relative contributions of type I IFN (IFN-I) to direct, cell-type-specific virus control or CD8 T-cell-mediated effectors in the CNS are unclear. IFN-I receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice infected with a sublethal and demyelinating neurotropic virus variant and those infected with a nonpathogenic neurotropic virus variant both succumbed to infection within 9 days. Compared to wild-type (wt) mice, replication was prominently increased in all glial cell types and spread to neurons, demonstrating expanded cell tropism. Furthermore, increased pathogenesis was associated with significantly enhanced accumulation of neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, and IFN-gamma within the CNS. The absence of IFN-I signaling did not impair induction or recruitment of virus-specific CD8 T cells, the primary adaptive mediators of virus clearance in wt mice. Despite similar IFN-gamma-mediated major histocompatibility complex class II upregulation on microglia in infected IFNAR(-/-) mice, class I expression was reduced compared to that on microglia in wt mice, suggesting a synergistic role of IFN-I and IFN-gamma in optimizing class I antigen presentation. These data demonstrate a critical direct antiviral role of IFN-I in controlling virus dissemination within the CNS, even in the presence of potent cellular immune responses. By limiting early viral replication and tropism, IFN-I controls the balance of viral replication and immune control in favor of CD8 T-cell-mediated protective functions.\\ntitle: Type I interferons are essential in controlling neurotropic coronavirus infection irrespective of functional CD8 T cells.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 42}), Document(page_content='abstract: As it spread globally, the new SARS-CoV-2 virus was first confirmed in Romania in February 2020, and since then over 40000 cases were diagnosed with COVID-19 Considering climate charges that showed a continuously increasing temperature and also the fact that nowadays air conditioning devices are used on daily bases not only in personal homes but also in healthcare facilities we raised the question if cooling air devices could contribute to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus For that, we searched data in the speciality literature regarding the potential of transmission of the virus through air conditioning Incorrect ventilation in indoor spaces can be associated with an increased transmission rate of respiratory infections as studies suggested Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as one of the infection disease control measure However, if those are not correctly used, they can contribute to the transmission of an airborne diseases as suggested by data from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship There are no clear data that can confirm if there is a link between aerosols produced by HVAC system and transmission of SARS CoV-2 virus and further extensive studies should be performed to either confirm or infirm this hypothesis\\ntitle: Covid-19 and Air Conditioning - Is There an Environmental Link?', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 43}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Identifying hotspots in a pandemic is essential for early containment.

The objective of this study is to determine whether proximity to an international airport predicted higher infection rates during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (US). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined the incidence of Covid-19 in areas near US international airports in the first weeks after detection of Covid-19 in all 50 states, using publicly available county-level incidence of Covid-19 data. They performed a multiple regression to determine the relative effects of population density and air traffic in the Counties Containing Airports (CCA) and the number of Covid-19 cases, and determined the odds of Covid-19 in CCA compared to the rest of the state. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that air traffic was significantly correlated with Covid-19 cases during the initial phase of pandemic while population density was not significantly correlated. Three weeks into the pandemic, the pooled odds of Covid-19 cases in CCA was 2.66 (95% CI [2.64, 2.68], p < 0.0001).

BACKGROUND: In Italy, the first confirmed case of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was registered on 21 February 2020. As of 20 April, about 250 000 cases were registered, 1143 of which were in the province of Pescara. METHODS: We compared transfusion services provided by the blood centre of Pescara between 1 March and 20 April 2019 and between 1 March and 20 April 2020. We assessed the number and type of blood components donated, those transfused in the various hospital departments and those transfused to Covid‐19 patients. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, we documented a decrease of 32% in the number of donations. The number of transfusions increased by 139% in the infectious diseases department (IDD), dedicated to Covid‐19 patients, and by 76% in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas it markedly decreased in the other departments. Of 299 patients with Covid‐19, 60 were transfused (20.1%). Transfused patients in the ICU were significantly younger than those in IDD and had a lower number of lymphocytes, lower post‐transfusion increment of haemoglobin levels and higher D‐dimer and C reactive protein values. Mortality rate was 60.7% among transfused patients in the ICU and 39.0% among those in the IDD (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The Covid‐19 epidemic had a profound impact on transfusion activities. The important blood demand for Covid‐19 patients was satisfied because of the reduction in activities in other hospital wards. Covid‐19‐positive transfused patients showed a very poor prognosis.\\ntitle: Impact of Covid‐19 epidemic on the activities of a blood centre, transfusion support for infected patients and clinical outcomes', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 45}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Background: Oscillometry is a tool to measure respiratory impedance that requires minimal patients' effort. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the correlation of respiratory impedance at rest with exertional ventilatory parameters, including exercise tolerance, has scarcely been reported. In addition, the utility of oscillometric parameters might differ between the inspiratory and expiratory phases due to airflow obstruction during expiration, but the hypothesis had not been validated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oscillometric parameters are associated with exertional ventilatory parameters in patients with COPD. Methods: Fifty-five subjects with COPD who attended clinics at the National Hospital Organization Osaka Toneyama Medical Center performed spirometry, oscillometry, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) within 2 weeks. The correlations between parameters of spirometry, oscillometry, and CPET were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, univariate, and multivariate analyses. Results: Respiratory reactance had better correlations with the CPET parameters than respiratory resistance. Moreover, inspiratory reactance at rest correlated with the CPET parameters stronger than expiratory reactance. In particular, inspiratory resonant frequency (Fres-ins) correlated with peak oxygen uptake (rS=-0.549, p<0.01) and dead space to tidal volume ratio at peak exercise (rS=0.677, p<0.01) and the best predicted expiratory tidal volume (VT ex) at peak exercise of all the oscillometric parameters (rS=-0.679, p<0.01). However, the correlation between Fres-ins and V T ex at peak exercise became weak in subjects with severe and very severe COPD during exercise. Conclusion: Measurement of respiratory reactance is useful for the effortless evaluation of not only exertional ventilatory parameters but exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. The correlation of respiratory impedance with exertional ventilatory parameters can become weak in patients with advanced COPD; thus, the measurement of oscillometry might not be appropriate for evaluating exertional ventilatory parameters of patients with advanced COPD.\\ntitle: Evaluation of Exertional Ventilatory Parameters Using Oscillometry in COPD\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 46}), Document(page_content='abstract: Cycloastragenol (CAG) is the active form of astragaloside IV isolated from Astragalus Radix, which displays multiple pharmacological effects. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether CAG protected against ischemic brain injury and, if so, whether the beneficial effects were associated with the regulation of SIRT1 in the ischemic brain. Mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. CAG (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion, 12 h later and then twice daily for up to three days. CAG dose-dependently reduced brain infarct volume, significantly ameliorated functional deficits, and prevented neuronal cell loss in MCAO mice. Meanwhile, CAG significantly reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, prevented tight junction degradation and subsequently ameliorated blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, CAG significantly upregulated SIRT1 expression in the ischemic brain but did not directly activate its enzymatic activity. Concomitant with SIRT1 upregulation, CAG reduced p53 acetylation and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in the ischemic brain. CAG also inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. As a result, CAG suppressed the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, and inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ischemic brain. Our findings suggest that CAG is neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury in mice and that its beneficial effect may involve SIRT1 upregulation and the inhibition of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain.\\ntitle: Cycloastragenol upregulates SIRT1 expression, attenuates apoptosis and suppresses neuroinflammation after brain ischemia', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 47}), Document(page_content='abstract: Introduction Le SRAS-CoV-2 est devenu le problème de santé public dans le monde entier depuis plus d’un an, provoquant des atteintes parfois mortelles.

Méthodes Il s’agissait d’une étude prospective qui s’est déroulée au mois de juin 2021 à Sfax. Le recueil des données s’est fait en parcourant des lieux publics (cafés, salons de thé, grandes surfaces…) et en invitant les participants à répondre à un questionnaire auto-administré à propos de la vaccination. Résultats Il s’agissait de 100 participants, dont la majorité étaient des hommes (56 %). La tranche d’âge entre 20 et 50 présentait 67 % des cas. Un niveau d’étude supérieur était noté dans 76 % des cas. Une activité professionnelle était notée dans 60 % des cas. Tous les candidats étaient aux courants du démarrage de la compagne de vaccination en Tunisie, dont 19, 57 % étaient inscrit dans la plate-forme evax. Des connaissances à propos des types de vaccins étaient présentes dans 90 % des cas. Au moins une dose de vaccin anti-COVID-19 était reçue par n =27 personnes, dont 88 % vaccinées par un vaccin à ARN. L’effet secondaire le plus fréquent était l’asthénie. L’absence totale d’une motivation à la vaccination était notée dans 45 % des cas, dont l’âge moyen était de 44 ans. La réticence a concerné tous les types de vaccins dans 90 % des cas. Le motif le plus fréquent du refus de la vaccination était la peur des effets secondaires. Pour les sujets motivés à se faire vacciner, le mobile était la présence de tares dans 22 % des cas et la volonté de protéger son entourage dans 27 % des cas. Par ailleurs, des comorbidités étaient présentes dans 33 % des cas. La vaccination était imposée par l’entourage chez n =6 personnes.

Small molecule inhibitors can also be used to alter expression and activity without affecting the stoichiometry of interacting partners. These tenets have been especially evident in the field of translation. Small molecule inhibitors were instrumental in enabling investigators to capture short-lived complexes and characterize specific steps of protein synthesis. In addition, several drugs that are the mainstay of modern antimicrobial drug therapy are potent inhibitors of prokaryotic translation. Currently, there is much interest in targeting eukaryotic translation as decades of research have revealed that deregulated protein synthesis in cancer cells represents a targetable vulnerability. In addition to being potential therapeutics, small molecules that manipulate translation have also been shown to influence cognitive processes such as memory.

Our aim was to analyze the influence of national lockdown during the first wave and the regional restrictions during the second wave on the rate of visits to the ED and urgent hand surgeries in Finland. METHODS: Material for this retrospective study was gathered from three Finnish hospitals All ED visits and urgent or emergency surgeries from January 2017 to December 2020 were included. Incidences per 100 000 persons with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and compared by incidence rate ratios (IRR). RESULTS: The incidence of hand injury was lower after the beginning of the lockdown in March 2020 (IRR 0.70 CI 0.63–0.78). After lockdown ended in May, the monthly incidences of ED visits returned to the reference level. During the lockdown, the incidence of fractures and dislocations was 42% lower in March (IRR 0.58 CI 0.50–0.68) and 33% lower in April 2020 (IRR 0.67 CI 0.57–0.80). The incidence of fracture repair surgeries was 43% lower in March 2020 (IRR 0.57 CI 0.35–0.93) and 41% lower in July 2020 (IRR 0.59 CI 0.36–0.98). Incidence of replantation was 49% higher in March 2020 (IRR 1.49 CI 0.53–4.20) and 200% higher in July 2020 (IRR 3.00 CI 0.68–13.2) but these increases had high uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of ED visits due to hand injuries decreased while the rate of emergency hand operations remained unchanged during the national COVID-19 lockdown in spring.

It serves as an introductory contribution to the Special Issue of this journal on ‘happy and healthy cities’, with particular emphasis on the implications of COVID-19 in pluriform cities. There is no doubt that contemporary cities are growing, and have become more dynamic and crowded. The more people, the bigger the challenges are to manage urban growth and to cope with—and control—density frictions, such as pandemics (e.g., COVID-19). Cities have the task to satisfy the essential needs of many heterogeneous people and to develop appropriate people-based strategies in order to make or keep people happy and healthy. The current COVID-19 disaster is a real urban challenge. The deployment of smart cities’ strategies and the use of digital technology tools in order to capture and provide intelligent internal and external online information and communication opportunities may help cities—in active partnership with their residents (‘smart citizens’ voice’)—to manage shocks and disruptions in the urban system. Clearly, cities are dynamic and adaptive organisms with a high resilience capacity. A key question addressed in this paper is whether urban inhabitants may be inclined to move out of the city due to human health threats, or whether intelligent digital technology tools will be able to overcome the current challenges to the ‘urban way of life’. The paper argues that modern information and communication technology offers a range of opportunities for a healthy city life, so that the COVID-19 pandemic will most likely not lead to a massive demographic outflow from urban agglomerations to less densely populated areas in particular rural areas. Instead, what is called the ‘corona crisis’ may cause just a ripple in the permanent dynamic evolution of cities.\\ntitle: A Post-Corona Perspective for Smart Cities: ‘Should I Stay or Should I Go?’', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 54}), Document(page_content='abstract: In this study, an analysis of the Chilean public health response to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is presented. The analysis is based on the daily transmission rate (DTR). The Chilean response has been based on dynamic quarantines, which are established, lifted or prolonged based on the percentage of infected individuals in the fundamental administrative sections, called communes. This analysis is performed at a national level, at the level of the Metropolitan Region (MR) and at the commune level in the MR according to whether the commune did or did not enter quarantine between late March and mid-May of 2020. The analysis shows a certain degree of efficacy in controlling the pandemic using the dynamic quarantine strategy. However, it also shows that apparent control has only been partially achieved to date. With this policy, the control of the DTR partially falls to 4%, where it settles, and the MR is the primary vector of infection at the country level. For this reason, we can conclude that the MR has not managed to control the disease, with variable results within its own territory.\\ntitle: Dynamic quarantine: a comparative analysis of the Chilean public health response to COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 55}), Document(page_content='abstract: Significant proportion of patients with dermatological disorders are on immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy predisposing them to risk of acquisition of COVID-19 infection.

Presented herein is the initial comparison of LESS donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN) and standard laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN). OBJECTIVE To determine whether LESS-DN provides any measurable benefit over LLDN during the perioperative period and subsequent convalescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between November 2007 and November 2008, 18 consecutive patients underwent LESS-DN (17 left DN, 1 right DN). A contemporary matched-pair cohort of 17 patients undergoing standard LLDN was selected for retrospective comparison. INTERVENTIONS LESS-DN was performed through an intraumbilical novel multichannel port. The kidney was extracted through a slightly extended umbilical incision. MEASUREMENTS All data were prospectively accrued in an institutional review board-approved database. Convalescence data included visual analog pain scores and questionnaires containing patient-reported time to recovery end points. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS One right-sided donor was converted to standard laparoscopy and excluded from analysis. Baseline demographics, operating time, blood loss, and hospital stay were comparable between groups. Compared to LLDN, patients undergoing LESS-DN had similar in-hospital analgesic requirements and mean visual analog scores at discharge. After discharge, patient-reported convalescence was faster in the LESS-DN group, including days on oral pain medication (20 vs 6; p=0.01), days off work (46 vs 18; p=0.0009), and days to 100% physical recovery (83 vs 29; p=0.03). Mean warm ischemia time was longer in the LESS-DN group (3 vs 6.1 min; p<0.0001); however, allograft function was immediate and comparable between groups. One allograft in the LESS-DN group thrombosed postoperatively. Regardless of laparoscopic approach, patients' global satisfaction with kidney donation and willingness to recommend their procedure to others were favorable and equivalent between groups. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective matched-pair comparison between LESS-DN and LLDN suggests that the single-port approach may be associated with quicker convalescence. In this initial series, LESS-DN had longer ischemia time, yet early allograft outcomes were comparable.\\ntitle: Laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) versus standard laparoscopic left donor nephrectomy: matched-pair comparison.\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 57}), Document(page_content='abstract: A new coronavirus has been found to cause the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of Covid-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R_0). This also enables us to estimate the daily transmission rate ({beta}) that determines the effect of social distancing. We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on Covid-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 1.78. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from April 13 till 7 May 2020. The R_0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37, 2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below one. Also, the estimated fractional reported symptomatic cases are between 10 to 50%.

Lung protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and low pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating patients with ARDS. Low-dose steroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may play a limited supportive role for early ARDS/acute lung injury, but it is contra-indicated in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure and haemodynamic instability. NPPV and oxygen therapy should be applied in healthcare facilities with good ventilation and respiratory protection as substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5 m and 0.4 m radius of patients receiving NPPV and oxygen via a simple mask, respectively. Intravenous gammaglobulin should be used with caution for treatment of reactive haemo-phagocytosis due to its thrombogenic effects, whereas the role of etoposide needs evaluation with animal models. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma may be useful as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of other drugs with immuno-modulating properties such as statins. Healthcare workers currently must apply strict standards, contact and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected cases, and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Non-pharmacological measures such as early case isolation, household quarantine, school/workplace closure, good community hygiene and restrictions on travel are useful measures in controlling a pandemic.\\ntitle: Influenza A/H5N1 infection: other treatment options and issues.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 64}), Document(page_content='abstract: We study entrainment in dry thermals in neutrally and unstably stratified ambients, and moist thermals in dry-neutrally stratified ambients using direct numerical simulations (DNS). We find, in agreement with results of Lecoanet and Jeevanjee \\\\tb{[J. Atmos. Sci. 76(12), 3785-3801, (2019)]} that turbulence plays a minor role in entrainment in dry thermals in a neutral ambient for Reynolds numbers $Re \\\\lesssim 10^4$. We then show that the net entrainment rate increases when the buoyancy of the thermals increases, either by condensation heating or because of an unstably stratified ambient. This is in contrast with the findings of Morrison et al. [J. Atmos. Sci. 78(3), 797-816, (2021)]. We also show that the role of turbulence is greater in these cases than in dry thermals and, significantly, that the combined action of condensation heating and turbulence creates intense small scale vorticity, destroying the {coherent} vortex ring that is seen in dry and moist laminar thermals. These findings suggest that fully resolved simulations at Reynolds numbers significantly larger than the mixing transition Reynolds number $Re=10^4$ are necessary to understand the role of turbulence in the entrainment in growing cumulus clouds, which consist of a series of thermals rising and decaying in succession.\\ntitle: Entrainment in dry and moist thermals', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 65}), Document(page_content='abstract: Aim and objective: Although two-wave pattern of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was observed in many countries, there is limited information on the impact of both the waves on clinical presentations of ectopic pregnancy (EP) with COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to understand the impact of the first wave and second wave of COVID-19 pandemic on women with EPs in India. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study at BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. We analyzed the impact of the first wave and second wave on women with EPs and the challenges encountered for management during the pandemic in our hospital. Results: A total of 1,660 pregnant and postpartum women with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were admitted at NH during the first wave and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cases of EP were asymptomatic for COVID-19. During the prepandemic period of 4 years, there were 220 (15.2 per 1,000 births) women with EPs, which was higher compared to seven EPs (6.3 per 1,000 births) during the COVID-19 pandemic. EP rate per 1,000 births during the second wave was found to be 9.6, which is comparatively higher than the first wave (3.8) (p = 0.24). Conclusion: Increased frequency of EPs during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic could be due to the new variant of concern B.1.617. 2 (Delta). For ruptured EP, we recommend surgical management with laparotomy as a treatment option as it is useful in reducing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to healthcare workers. Clinical significance: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to last longer and hence healthcare providers should ensure that pregnant women have access to medical assistance whenever needed. © The Author(s). 2021.\\ntitle: Impact of Both the Waves of COVID-19 Pandemic on Ectopic Pregnancy in India', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 66}), Document(page_content='abstract: The aim of current study is to develop new nanostructured lipid carrier systems (NLCSs) containing imatinib mesylate (IMT) and evaluate their targeting efficiency on NIH-3T3 as fibroblast cells and CRL-1739 as gastric adenocarcinoma cells with radiolabeled formulations. Three formulations (F1-IMT, F2-IMT and F3-IMT) were prepared and radiolabeled with 1 mCi/0.1 mL of [99mTc]Tc. The effect of reducing and antioxidant agents on radiolabeling process was evaluated and radiochemical purity of formulations was performed by radio thin-layer radiochromatography (RTLC). The results demonstrated that the radiochemical purity was found to be above 90% for [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc-F2-IMT, while radiochemical purity of [99mTc]Tc-F3-IMT was found to be 85.61 ± 2.24%. Also, [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc-F2-IMT have better stability in cell medium and saline than [99mTc]Tc-F3-IMT. Targeting efficiency of [99mTc]Tc-F1-IMT and [99mTc]Tc-F2-IMT comparatively evaluated by cell binding studies with [99mTc]NaTcO4 on NIH-3T3 and CRL-1739 cells. The cell binding capacity and targeting/non-targeting cell uptake ratio of these two formulations was found to be higher than [99mTc]NaTcO4 in CRL-1739.

Methods 43 COVID-19 inpatients and 326 screening subjects underwent naso-pharyngeal (NP)-swab and saliva collection (Salivette). Inpatients also underwent repeated blood collections to evaluate inflammation and organs involvement. In all patients and subjects, SARS-CoV-2 (gene E) rRT-PCR was undertaken in saliva and NP-swabs. Salivary IgA and serum IgA, IgG, IgM were measured on inpatients’ samples. Results NP-swabs and saliva were both SARS-CoV-2 positive in 7 (16%) or both negative in 35 (82%) out of 43 patients successfully included in the study. NP-swabs and saliva results did not perfectly match in one patient (saliva positive, NP-swab negative). Positive molecular results were significantly associated with disease duration (p=0.0049). 326/326 screening subjects were SARS-CoV-2 negative on both NP-swabs and saliva. Among the 27 saliva samples tested for IgA, 18 were IgA positive. Salivary IgA positivity was associated with pneumonia (p=0.002) and CRP values (p=0.0183), not with other clinical and molecular data, or with serum immunoglubulins. Conclusions A standardized saliva collection can be adopted to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in alternative to NP-swabs.

Epigenetic modification has been found to play an important role in cell differentiation and regulation, among which histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in suppressing genes by removing histone acetyl groups. The use of HDAC inhibitor to control this is increasing and has been widely studied by many researchers. This study aimed to induce differentiation by causing epigenetic changes in odontoblast-related genes and the MAPK signaling pathway in human dental pulp stem cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed increased expression of DMP-1, ALP, DSPP, and RUNX2 compared to the control. However, activation of the MAPK signaling system was similar to but slightly different from the expression of odontoblast-related proteins. After 3 days, as shown by MTT and LDH assays, proliferation decreased overall, but cytotoxicity decreased at only a specific concentration. We confirmed that there was no change in mRNA expression of caspase 3 or 9 using real-time PCR. In addition, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that differentiation occurred due to the decrease in the expression of the CD73 and CD146. Although overall proliferation was reduced due to the G2/M inhibition of the cell cycle, the expression of BCL-2 protected the cells from cell death. Overall, cell proliferation decreased in response to MS-275, but it did not induce cytotoxicity in 5 nM and 10 nM concentration and induces differentiation into odontoblast-like cells.\\ntitle: The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (MS-275) Promotes Differentiation of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells into Odontoblast-Like Cells Independent of the MAPK Signaling System', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 71}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN) is responsible for significant percentage of transplanted kidneys prematurely terminating their function. Its occurrence is closely related to the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS In a group of 161 newly transplanted patients we prospectively evaluated 457 protocol renal biopsies performed within the first year after transplantation. Using the calcineurin inhibitors nephrotoxicity score, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was monitored as a manifestation of excessive immunosuppression. Findings were correlated with clinical evidence of active BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) replication and PyVAN. RESULTS Compared to the normal histology, nephrotoxicity was associated with more frequent BKPyV viraemia and viruria (P = 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) and more common occurrence of PyVAN. The persistence of toxicity in the subsequent biopsy proved to be a negative risk factor of viraemia and viruria (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively), independently of the initial BKPyV status. Toxicity could also be used as a predictor of viraemia and viruria (P = 0.04 and P < 0.01, respectively) even in the absence of viral replication at the time of initial biopsy. CONCLUSIONS Early histological manifestation of calcineurin inhibitors nephrotoxicity was associated with significant BKPyV reactivation in the risky first posttransplant year.

However, due to the limitation of their on-board power and flight time, it is challenging to obtain an optimal resource allocation scheme for the UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we design a new UAV-assisted IoT systems relying on the shortest flight path of the UAVs while maximising the amount of data collected from IoT devices. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based technique is conceived for finding the optimal trajectory and throughput in a specific coverage area. After training, the UAV has the ability to autonomously collect all the data from user nodes at a significant total sum-rate improvement while minimising the associated resources used. Numerical results are provided to highlight how our techniques strike a balance between the throughput attained, trajectory, and the time spent. More explicitly, we characterise the attainable performance in terms of the UAV trajectory, the expected reward and the total sum-rate.\\ntitle: 3D UAV Trajectory and Data Collection Optimisation via Deep Reinforcement Learning', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 73}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to describe the experience of, and factors associated with, disordered eating in a population‐based sample of emerging adults during the COVID‐19 outbreak. METHOD: Participants in the EAT 2010–2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C‐EAT (COVID‐19 EAT) survey in April–May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7 ± 2.0 years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID‐19 pandemic were examined as cross‐sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open‐ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. RESULTS: Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic‐related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re‐emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.\\ntitle: Disordered eating in a population‐based sample of young adults during the COVID‐19 outbreak', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 74}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: Residual paralysis following anaesthesia is common and can lead to postoperative morbidity. While sugammadex has been shown to be effective in minimising residual paralysis, uncertainty exists as to whether its use reduces any associated morbidity. We designed this trial to determine if the use of sugammadex for the reversal of intraoperative aminosteroid neuromuscular blockade results in improvements in postoperative pulmonary complications, complications in the recovery unit, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and patient satisfaction, when compared to reversal with neostigmine. Methods: A prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial in adult patients admitted for surgical operations at two Australian hospitals between December 2018 and March 2019 was performed comparing the reversal of neuromuscular paralysis using sugammadex 2mg/kg versus neostigmine 50mcg/kg. Statistical analysis of continuous data was performed using two tailed t-tests, with categorical and ordinal data was assessed by Chi-squared analysis. Results: The trial was terminated due to a combination of resource constraints and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Of 51 patients screened, 33 were eligible for participation and 30 subsequently recruited and randomised. All patients received the intended treatment allocated. Data for the primary outcome was obtained in all patients. There was no difference in the rates of postoperative pulmonary complications between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups (0% (0/19) vs 9% (1/11) RR 5.0 (95%CI 0.22-113) p=0.37. There was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes between the groups. Conclusions: The P-PERSoN trial showed no difference in post operative pulmonary complications between sugammadex and neostigmine based reversal of aminosteroid neuromuscular block, but was underpowered to show any difference due to early trial termination. The randomisation and data collection was feasible. We support the need for an adequately resourced and funded randomised controlled trial to address this important clinical question.

In fact, HA matrices are increasingly considered as a barometer of inflammation. A number of proteins specifically recognize the HA structure and these interactions modify cell behavior and control the stability of the ECM. Moreover, inflamed airways are remarkably rich with HA and are associated with various inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis, influenza, sepsis, and more recently coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, and infected individuals have a wide range of disease manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe illness. Critically ill COVID-19 patient cases are frequently complicated by development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which typically leads to poor outcomes with high mortality rate. In general, ARDS is characterized by poor oxygenation accompanied with severe lung inflammation, damage, and vascular leakage and has been suggested to be linked to an accumulation of HA within the airways. Here, we provide a succinct overview of known inflammatory mechanisms regulated by HA in general, and those both observed and postulated in critically ill patients with COVID-19.\\ntitle: The role of hyaluronan synthesis and degradation in the critical respiratory illness COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 76}), Document(page_content='abstract: Objetivo: discutir as experiências e contradições no controle da pandemia de Covid-19 sob a perspectiva da epidemiologia e das políticas públicas brasileiras Conteúdo: o debate apresentado divide-se em duas seções: a primeira traça a reflexão dos parâmetros epidemiológicos sobre a curva epidêmica do SARS-CoV-2, bem como as experiências internacionais para o controle deste fenômeno A segunda, ancorada nas políticas públicas brasileiras, apresenta uma análise comparada das experiências nacionais e internacionais, discutindo os potenciais reflexos sobre a pandemia, considerando algumas especificidades sociais Conclusão: frente à impossibilidade de redução de pessoas susceptíveis por meio de estratégias vacinais, a redução da velocidade da curva epidêmica precisa ocorrer por meio de ações de isolamento físico social Ademais, a construção de políticas públicas que visem a proteção ao trabalhador e a ampliação do investimento no setor saúde são medidas urgentes Objective: to discuss experiences and contradictions in the control of the Covid-19 pandemic from the perspective of epidemiology and Brazilian public policies Content: the discussion presented is divided into two sections: the first one present epidemiological parameters on the epidemic curve of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the international experiences for the control of this phenomenon The second, anchored in the Brazilian public policies, presents a comparative analysis of national and international experiences, discussing the potential impacts on the pandemic, considering some specific social issues Conclusion: in the face of impossibility of reducing susceptible people through vaccination strategies, the reduction of the speed of the epidemic curve needs to occur through actions of social distance In addition, the construction of public policies aimed at protecting workers and expanding investment in the health sector are urgent measures Objetivo: discutir las experiencias y contradicciones en el control de la pandemia Covid-19 desde la perspectiva de la epidemiología brasileña y las políticas públicas Contenido: el debate presentado se divide en dos secciones El primero traza la reflexión de los parámetros epidemiológicos en la curva epidémica del SARS-CoV-2, así como las experiencias internacionales para el control de este fenómeno El segunda seccione, anclada en las políticas públicas brasileñas, presenta un análisis comparativo de las experiencias nacionales e internacionales, discutiendo los posibles impactos en la pandemia, considerando algunas especificidades sociales brasileñas Conclusión: dada la imposibilidad de reducir a las personas susceptibles a través de estrategias de vacunación, la reducción de la velocidad de la curva epidémica debe ocurrir a través de acciones de aislamiento social y físico Además, la construcción de políticas públicas destinadas a proteger a los trabajadores y ampliar la inversión en el sector de la salud son medidas urgentes\\ntitle: Epidemiologia, políticas públicas e pandemia de Covid-19: o que esperar no Brasil?', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 77}), Document(page_content='abstract: RNA viruses are the fastest evolving known biological entities. Consequently, the sequence similarity between homologous viral proteins disappears quickly, limiting the usability of traditional sequence-based phylogenetic methods in the reconstruction of relationships and evolutionary history among RNA viruses. Protein structures, however, typically evolve more slowly than sequences, and structural similarity can still be evident, when no sequence similarity can be detected. Here, we used an automated structural comparison method, homologous structure finder, for comprehensive comparisons of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). We identified a common structural core of 231 residues for all the structurally characterized viral RdRps, covering segmented and non-segmented negative-sense, positive-sense, and double-stranded RNA viruses infecting both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. The grouping and branching of the viral RdRps in the structure-based phylogenetic tree follow their functional differentiation. The RdRps using protein primer, RNA primer, or self-priming mechanisms have evolved independently of each other, and the RdRps cluster into two large branches based on the used transcription mechanism. The structure-based distance tree presented here follows the recently established RdRp-based RNA virus classification at genus, subfamily, family, order, class and subphylum ranks.

DATA SOURCES: Eligible studies published until May 28, 2020, were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, medRxiv, and bioRxiv collection databases. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: This systematic review included cohort studies, case series, and case reports of pregnant women who received a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test and had reported data regarding the testing of neonates or fetuses for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immediately after birth and within 48 hours of birth. A total of 30 eligible case reports describing 43 tested neonates and 38 cohort or case series studies describing 936 tested neonates were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The methodological quality of all included studies was evaluated by a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Quantitative synthesis was performed on cohort or case series studies according to the neonatal biological specimen site to reach pooled proportions of vertical transmission. RESULTS: Our quantitative synthesis revealed that of 936 neonates from mothers with coronavirus disease 2019, 27 neonates had a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test using nasopharyngeal swab, indicating a pooled proportion of 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.3) for vertical transmission. Of note, the pooled proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity in neonates by nasopharyngeal swab in studies from China was 2.0% (8/397), which was similar to the pooled proportion of 2.7% (14/517) in studies from outside of China. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA testing in neonatal cord blood was positive in 2.9% of samples (1/34), 7.7% of placenta samples (2/26), 0% of amniotic fluid (0/51), 0% of urine samples (0/17), and 9.7% of fecal or rectal swabs (3/31). Neonatal serology was positive in 3 of 82 samples (3.7%) (based on the presence of immunoglobulin M). CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is possible and seems to occur in a minority of cases of maternal coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the third trimester. The rates of infection are similar to those of other pathogens that cause congenital infections. However, given the paucity of early trimester data, no assessment can yet be made regarding the rates of vertical transmission in early pregnancy and potential risk for consequent fetal morbidity and mortality.\\ntitle: Vertical transmission of coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 79}), Document(page_content='abstract: Abstract The appropriate focus in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been addressing access and delivery of care to the population impacted by the outbreak.

Hospitals have received billions of dollars to support and enable them to handle emergencies and cover the cost of the disruption. However, many Vascular Surgeons are under great financial pressure because of postponement of all non-emergency procedures. The Federal Government has announced a myriad of programs in the form of grants and loans to reimburse physicians for some expenses and loss of revenue.

So it is very essential to step towards the much earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. In general, early stage diagnosis techniques mainly consider Chest X-Rays, Computed Tomography and Ultrasound videos as well as frames. Visually identifying and examining these clinical images in case of any hidden abnormalities seems to be a challenging and also time consuming task, wherein a huge amount of information needs to be processed in a limited time period given. The concept of Transfer Learning on medical imaging is currently emerging and shows a lot of research potential in terms of dealing with scarce medical images.

In response to this pandemic, most psychological responses have been at a higher prevalence such as stress, anxiety, depression, lower mental well-being, poor sleep quality, along with the fear of contracting the COVID-19 disease. Related to these psychological responses, previous studies have suggested an association between COVID-19 fear and stress as well as stress and sleep quality. The present study aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality and investigate the possible mediating effect of perceived stress during this pandemic. The data were collected, utilizing a self-report online questionnaire, from a sample of 521 Bangladeshi adults. Results showed significant gender differences in COVID-19 fear, stress, and sleep quality and also a significant association between these variables. Mediation results revealed that stress fully mediated the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality for males and partially mediated it for females. These results suggest that women are in a more vulnerable position in this pandemic.

METHODS: Upper respiratory samples of HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A case-control study was conducted to explore the possible risk factors that lead to SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. RESULTS: Of 703 HCWs screened between March 20 and May 20, 2020, 50 (7.1%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 among physicians, nurses, cleaning personnel, and the other occupations were 6.3%, 8.0%, 9.1%, and 2.6%, respectively. The infection rate was 8.3% among HCWs who worked in COVID-19 units and 3.4% among those who did not work in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) units (RRâ\\x80¯=â\\x80¯2.449, confidence interval = 1.062-5.649, P= .027). The presence of a SARS-CoV-2 positive person in the household (P = .016), inappropriate use of personnel protective equipment while caring for patients with COVID-19 infection (P = .003), staying in the same personnel break room as an HCW without a medical mask for more than 15 minutes (P = .000), consuming food within 1 m of an HCW (P = .003), and failure to keep a safe social distance from an HCW (P = .003) were statistically significant risk factors for infection. CONCLUSION: HCWs have a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to COVID-19 patients. Transmission may also occur in nonmedical areas of the hospital while speaking or eating.

The survey included the GAD-7 anxiety scale, PHQ-9 scale of depression severity and the UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale (3rd revision), as well as questions about the pandemic’s impact on physical and mental wellbeing in the month of April and long-term physical and mental health. Although loneliness did not differ among groups, students reported the highest levels of moderate/severe depression (46.6%), followed by faculty (21.1%) and staff (6.9%). Students also reported the highest levels of moderate/severe anxiety (48.6%) compared with faculty (29.4%) and staff (12.1%). Students were more likely to say the pandemic moderately or very much impacted their overall physical and mental wellbeing in April. However, faculty were more likely to report that their long-term physical and mental health would be somewhat/greatly affected, followed by students, and then staff.

But the bioactive compounds and potential mechanisms of TJQW for COVID-19 prevention and treatment are unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of TJQW in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on an integrated network pharmacology approach. METHODS: TCMSP were used to search and screen the active ingredients in TJQW. The Swiss TargetPrediction was used to predict the potential targets of active ingredients. Genes co-expressed with ACE2 were considered potential therapeutic targets on COVID-19. Venn diagram was created to show correlative targets of TJQW against COVID-19. Cytoscape was used to construct a “drug-active ingredient-potential target” network, STRING were used to construct protein-protein interaction network, and cytoHubba performed network topology analysis. Enrichment of biological functions and signaling pathways of core targets was performed by using the clusterProfiler package in R software and ClueGO with CluePedia plugins in Cytoscape. RESULTS: A total of 156 active ingredients were obtained through oral bioavailability and drug-likeness screenings. Two hundred twenty-seven potential targets of TJQW were related to COVID-19. The top ten core targets are EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, ESR1, FPR2, F2, BCL2L1, BDKRB2, MPO, and ACE. Based on that, we obtained 19 key active ingredients: umbelliprenin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, praeruptorin E, stigmasterol, and oroxylin A. And the enrichment analysis obtained multiple related gene ontology functions and signaling pathways. Lastly, we constructed a key network of “drug-component-target-biological process-signaling pathway”. Our findings suggested that TJQW treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including regulation of inflammatory response, viral process, neutrophil mediated immunity, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying TJQW treatment for COVID-19. These results should benefit efforts for people around the world to gain more knowledge about Chinese medicine TJQW in the treatment of this vicious epidemic COVID-19, and help to address this pressing problem currently facing the world.\\ntitle: Therapeutic mechanism of Toujie Quwen granules in COVID-19 based on network pharmacology', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 89}), Document(page_content='abstract: N/A.\\ntitle: Hematological Aspects of COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 90}), Document(page_content='abstract: Despite the availability of effective vaccines, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that co-circulation with other pathogens and resulting multi-epidemics -- such as twindemics of COVID-19 and influenza -- will become increasingly frequent. To better forecast and control the risk of such multi-epidemics, it is essential to elucidate the potential interactions of SARS-CoV- 2 with other pathogens; these interactions, however, remain poorly defined. Here, we aimed to review the current body of evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. To study pathogen interactions in a systematic way, we first developed a general framework to capture their major components - namely, sign, strength, symmetry, duration, and mechanism. We then reviewed the experimental evidence from animal models about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. The studies identified demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus co-infection increased disease severity compared with mono-infection. By contrast, the effect of previous or co-infection on viral load of either virus was inconsistent across studies. Next, we reviewed the epidemiological evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions in human populations. Although numerous studies were identified, only few were specifically designed to infer interaction and many were prone to bias and confounding. Nevertheless, their results suggested that influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations were associated with reduced risk, and earlier influenza infection with increased risk, of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Finally, we formulated simple transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 co-circulation with a virus or a bacterium, showing how they can naturally incorporate the proposed framework. More generally, we propose that such models, when designed with an integrative and multidisciplinary perspective, will be invaluable tools in studying SARS-CoV-2 interactions with other pathogens.\\ntitle: The interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with co-circulating pathogens: Epidemiological implications and current knowledge gaps', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 91}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19), a current worldwide pandemic is a cuase of concern. Risk-adjusted differences in outcomes of the patients are not well characterized. Susceptibility to infection with respect to blood group, blood pressure, pulse rate, hemoglobin, age and BMI were analyzed. METHODS: Blood donors, of all the ages and gender, who recovered from COVID-19 infection, were selected for the study Samples from Regional laboratory and the Central blood bank of Hafr al Batin, Saudi Arabia were collected. Out of 1508 healthy blood donor 134 had recovered from corona without any preexisting diseases. RESULTS: Major donors were male (85.1%). 28% donors in age range of 26-35 years. O+(32.8%) were the highest donors. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate elevated significantly of age group 46-55 (p<0.05) and 56-65 (p<0.001). Systolic blood pressure in males (134.13 ± 9.57) was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of females (129.35 ± 10.61). Donors with Rh+ significantly higher systolic (p<0.05) and pulse rate (p<0.05) as compared to Rh-. DISCUSSION: O+ donors were highly susceptible. Blood pressure, pulse rate and Hb alter with age. Males exhibit higher variation in systolic blood pressure, with Rh+ factor playing a predominant role. Donors above 45-years of age and a high BMI have significantly elevated blood pressure and pulse. These results are challenging or contradictory from the results of Turkish and Chinese studies where blood group A+ was more predominantly affected by the SARS-CoV-2 with minimum infection rate on females and Rh- donors.

MethodsWe conducted an observational, prospective case series study in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Clinical outcome data (Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality) were collected from all patients until discharge. Viremia was determined longitudinally during hospitalisation, in plasma and serum samples using two commercial and standardised RT-PCR techniques approved for use in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Viral load (copies/mL and log10) was determined with quantitative TaqPathCOVID-19 test. ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viremia was studied in 57 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Persistent viremia (PV) was defined as two or more quantifiable viral loads detected in blood samples (plasma/serum) during hospitalisation. PV was detected in 16 (28%) patients. All of them, except for one who rapidly progressed to death, cleared viremia during hospitalisation. Poor clinical outcome occurred in 62.5% of patients with PV, while none of the negative patients or those with sporadic viremia presented this outcome (p<0.0001). Viral load was significantly higher in patients with PV than in those with Sporadic Viremia (p<0.05). Patients presented PV for a short period of time: median time from admission was 5 days (Range=2-12) and 4.5 days (Range=2-8) for plasma and serum samples, respectively.

Use of location-based social media image data (eg, Instagram images) is one possible approach that could be explored to address this problem. OBJECTIVE: We seek to evaluate whether publicly available near real-time social media images might be used to monitor COVID-19 health policy adherence. METHODS: We collected a sample of 43,487 Instagram images in New York from February 7 to April 11, 2020, from the following location hashtags: #Centralpark (n=20,937), #Brooklyn Bridge (n=14,875), and #Timesquare (n=7675). After manually reviewing images for accuracy, we counted and recorded the frequency of valid daily posts at each of these hashtag locations over time, as well as rated and counted whether the individuals in the pictures at these location hashtags were social distancing (ie, whether the individuals in the images appeared to be distanced from others vs next to or touching each other). We analyzed the number of images posted over time and the correlation between trends among hashtag locations. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant decline in the number of posts over time across all regions, with an approximate decline of 17% across each site (P<.001). We found a positive correlation between hashtags (#Centralpark and #Brooklynbridge: r=0.40; #BrooklynBridge and #Timesquare: r=0.41; and #Timesquare and #Centralpark: r=0.33; P<.001 for all correlations). The logistic regression analysis showed a mild statistically significant increase in the proportion of posts over time with people appearing to be social distancing at Central Park (P=.004) and Brooklyn Bridge (P=.02) but not for Times Square (P=.16).

Since, the infection crossed geographical barriers, the WHO permanently named the causing disease as COVID-2019 by declaring it a pandemic situation. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus causing a wide range of pathological conditions from common cold symptoms to pneumonia and fatal severe respiratory syndrome. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed 96% identity to the bat coronavirus and 79.6% sequence identity to the previous SARS-CoV. The main protease (known as 3C-like proteinase/ Mpro) plays a vital role during the infection with the processing of replicase polyprotein thus offering an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares 97% sequence identity, with 12 variable residues but none of them present in the catalytic and substrate binding site. With the high level of sequence and structural similarity and absence of any drug/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing against Mpro is an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. Here, we report a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with SARS-CoV Mpro using molecular dynamics simulations to assess the impact of 12 divergent residues on the molecular microenvironment of Mpro. A structural comparison and analysis is made on how these variable residues affects the intra-molecular interactions between key residues in the monomer and biologically active dimer form of Mpro. The present MD simulations study concluded the change in microenvironment of active-site residues at the entrance (T25, T26, M49 and Q189), near the catalytic region (F140, H163, H164, M165 and H172) and other residues in substrate binding site (V35T, N65S, K88R and N180K) due to 12 mutation incorporated in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 dimer is more stable and less flexible state compared to monomer which may be due to these variable residues, mainly F140, E166 and H172 which are involved in dimerization. This also warrants a need for inhibitor design considering the more stable dimer form. The mutation accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro indirectly reconfigures the key molecular networks around the active site conferring a potential change in SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a challenge in drug repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19.

The authors newly designed and manufactured a small diameter-deep hole drilling machine by applying technological developments which consist of a direct drive servo spindle motor controlled more precisely, removable steady rests to prevent for a slender fluted hollow shaft of gun drill to be deflected and a highly pressure circulation system of cutting fluid to prevent being clogged with chips. By using the small diameter-deep hole drilling machine and a special gun drill (specially made to order in BOTEK) a drilling of ϕ1.0×400 mm (L/D=400) for Ti6Al4V was carried out. As a result, it was ascertained that the drilled hole has high accuracy in the items of hole diameter, concentricity, roundness and inner surface roughness.\\ntitle: Small Diameter-Deep Hole Drilling for Hard-to-Machine Metals ― Drilling of ϕ1.0×400 mm for Ti6Al4V ―', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 104}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: The authors evaluate the importance of prevention measures and health care from their own experience and briefly analyse the factors that may have contributed to the rapid spread of Covid-19 in Italy, and hope this will feed into appropriate and new and improved health policies.\\ntitle: Are there positive lessons for Italy's NHS resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic?\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 105}), Document(page_content='abstract: Coronavirus (COVID-19), one of the deadliest pandemic diseases of the century, escalated at such a fast rate that around 25 million people around the world got infected.

IS 1 mutants with a 1 by insertion, which encode mutant transposases with an amino acid substitution within the polypeptide segment at residues 84–87, did not efficiently mediate cointegration, except for an IS 1 mutant which encodes a mutant transposase with a Leu-Arg-Lys-Leu segment instead of Leu-LysLys-Leu. An IS 1 mutant with the DNA segment 5′-CTTAAAAACTC-3′ at positions 305–315 carrying the termination codon TAA in the B′-insB reading frame could still mediate cointegration, indicating that codon AAA for Lys corresponding to second, third and fourth positions in the run of adenines is the site of frameshifting.

Sex disparities in genetics, immunological responses, and hormonal mechanisms may underlie the substantially higher fatality rates reported in male COVID-19 patients. To optimise care for COVID-19 patients, prophylactic and therapeutic studies should include sex-specific design and analyses. Therefore, in this scoping review, we investigated whether studies on pharmacological treatment in COVID-19 were performed based on a priori sex-specific design or post-hoc sex-specific analyses. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, UpToDate, clinical trial.org, and MedRxiv for studies on pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 until June 6th, 2020. We included case series, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in humans (≥18 years) investigating antiviral, antimalarial, and immune system modulating drugs. Data were collected on 1) the proportion of included females, 2) whether sex stratification was performed (a priori by design or post-hoc), and 3) whether effect modification by sex was investigated. FINDINGS: 30 studies were eligible for inclusion, investigating remdesivir (n = 2), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 5), favipiravir (n = 1), umifenovir (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n = 8), convalescent plasma (n = 6), interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway inhibitors (n = 5), interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway inhibitors (n = 1) and corticosteroids (n = 3). Only one study stratified its data based on sex in a post-hoc analysis, whereas none did a priori by design. None of the studies investigated effect modification by sex. A quarter of the studies included twice as many males as females. INTERPRETATION: Analyses assessing potential interference of sex with (side-)effects of pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 are rarely reported.

Consequently, this research aims to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic using spatio-temporal analysis methods at the county level in Hubei province. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran's I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population. Therefore, enhancing the ability to diagnose the disease and controlling the movement of the population can be confirmed as effective measures to prevent and control the regional outbreak of the epidemic.\\ntitle: Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic at the County Level in Hubei Province, China\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 113}), Document(page_content='abstract: As the COVID-19 crisis spreads around the globe, the rhetoric about the pandemic evoked by journalists and politicians harks back to that of prior diseases and epidemics.

In addition, it is intended to assess if the food security pillars properly address the sustainability goals and if the evolution of undernutrition is accompanied by sustainable frameworks. In this way, statistical information from the FAOSTAT database was considered for the several dimensions of food security over the period 2000–2020. These data were analysed through factor-cluster approaches and panel data methodologies, namely those related to quantile regressions. As main insights, we may refer that undernutrition is more impacted by the availability of food and nutrients and political stability than by the level of GDP—Gross Domestic Product (except for the extreme cases). This means that the level of development is not the primary explanation for the problems of nutrition. The main focus of the national and international policies must be to improve the agrifood supply chains and to support political stability, in order to mitigate undernutrition worldwide and ensure a global access to sustainable and healthy diets.

However, the state-of-the-art general face recognition models do not generalize well to occluded face images, which are exactly the common cases in real-world scenarios. The potential reasons are the absences of large-scale occluded face data for training and specific designs for tackling corrupted features brought by occlusions. This paper presents a novel face recognition method that is robust to occlusions based on a single end-to-end deep neural network. Our approach, named FROM (Face Recognition with Occlusion Masks), learns to discover the corrupted features from the deep convolutional neural networks, and clean them by the dynamically learned masks. In addition, we construct massive occluded face images to train FROM effectively and efficiently. FROM is simple yet powerful compared to the existing methods that either rely on external detectors to discover the occlusions or employ shallow models which are less discriminative. Experimental results on the LFW, Megaface challenge 1, RMF2, AR dataset and other simulated occluded/masked datasets confirm that FROM dramatically improves the accuracy under occlusions, and generalizes well on general face recognition.\\ntitle: End2End Occluded Face Recognition by Masking Corrupted Features', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 117}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Substantial progress has been made in reducing the burden of malaria in Africa since 2000, but those gains could be jeopardised if the COVID-19 pandemic affects the availability of key malaria control interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate plausible effects on malaria incidence and mortality under different levels of disruption to malaria control. METHODS: Using an established set of spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical models, we generated geospatial estimates across malaria-endemic African countries of the clinical case incidence and mortality of malaria, incorporating an updated database of parasite rate surveys, insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage, and effective treatment rates. We established a baseline estimate for the anticipated malaria burden in Africa in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions, and repeated the analysis for nine hypothetical scenarios in which effective treatment with an antimalarial drug and distribution of ITNs (both through routine channels and mass campaigns) were reduced to varying extents. FINDINGS: We estimated 215·2 (95% uncertainty interval 143·7-311·6) million cases and 386·4 (307·8-497·8) thousand deaths across malaria-endemic African countries in 2020 in our baseline scenario of undisrupted intervention coverage. With greater reductions in access to effective antimalarial drug treatment, our model predicted increasing numbers of cases and deaths: 224·1 (148·7-326·8) million cases and 487·9 (385·3-634·6) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction in antimalarial drug coverage; 233·1 (153·7-342·5) million cases and 597·4 (468·0-784·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 242·3 (158·7-358·8) million cases and 715·2 (556·4-947·9) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. Halting planned 2020 ITN mass distribution campaigns and reducing routine ITN distributions by 25%-75% also increased malaria burden to a total of 230·5 (151·6-343·3) million cases and 411·7 (322·8-545·5) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 232·8 (152·3-345·9) million cases and 415·5 (324·3-549·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 234·0 (152·9-348·4) million cases and 417·6 (325·5-553·1) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. When ITN coverage and antimalarial drug coverage were synchronously reduced, malaria burden increased to 240·5 (156·5-358·2) million cases and 520·9 (404·1-691·9) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 251·0 (162·2-377·0) million cases and 640·2 (492·0-856·7) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 261·6 (167·7-396·8) million cases and 768·6 (586·1-1038·7) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. INTERPRETATION: Under pessimistic scenarios, COVID-19-related disruption to malaria control in Africa could almost double malaria mortality in 2020, and potentially lead to even greater increases in subsequent years. To avoid a reversal of two decades of progress against malaria, averting this public health disaster must remain an integrated priority alongside the response to COVID-19.

How porcine FcRn (pFcRn) expression is regulated by pathogenic infection remains unknown. Our research shows that IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV had up-regulated pFcRn expression. In addition, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV infection. Furthermore, treatment of TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-κB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 resulted in down-regulation of pFcRn expression. Transient transfection of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids with overexpression of NF-κB p65 transcription factor enhanced the activation of the luciferase report plasmids. We identified four NF-κB transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of this gene using luciferase reporter system, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and supershift analysis.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the variables associated with patient acceptation or refusal to participate in clinical research. Specifically, we sought to evaluate if distrust in pharmaceutical companies and associated psychosocial factors could represent a recruitment bias in clinical trials and thus threaten the applicability of their results. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter survey consisted in the administration of a self-questionnaire to patients during a pulmonology consultation. The 1025 questionnaires distributed collected demographics, socio-professional and basic health literacy characteristics. Patients were asked to rank their level of trust for pharmaceutical companies and indicate their willingness to participate in different categories of research (pre or post marketing, sponsored by an academic institution or pharmaceutical company). Logistic regression was used to determine factors contributing to “trust” versus “distrust” group membership and willingness to participate in each category of research. RESULTS: One thousand patients completed the survey, corresponding to a response rate of 97.5%. Data from 838 patients were analyzed in this study. 48.3% of respondents declared that they trusted pharmaceutical companies, while 35.5% declared distrust. Being female (p = 0.042), inactive in the employment market(p = 0.007), and not-knowing the name of one’s disease(p = 0.010) are factors related to declared distrust. Distrust-group membership is associated with unwillingness to participate in certain categories of trials such as pre-marketing and industry-sponsored trials. CONCLUSION: Distrust in pharmaceutical companies is associated with a specific patient profile and with refusal to participate in certain subcategories of trials.

Among these, viruses are especially difficult to tackle due to the sudden transfer from animals to humans, high mutational rates, resistance to current treatments, and the intricacies of their molecular interactions with the host. As an example of these interactions, we describe a cell-based approach to monitor specific proteolytic events executed by either the viral-encoded protease or by host proteins on the virus. We then emphasize the significance of examining proteolysis within the subcellular compartment where cleavage occurs naturally. We show the power of stable expression, highlighting the usefulness of the cell-based multiplexed approach, which we have adapted to two independent assays previously developed to monitor (a) the activity of the HIV-1-encoded protease or (b) the cleavage of the HIV-1-encoded envelope protein by the host. Multiplexing was achieved by mixing cells each carrying a different assay or, alternatively, by engineering cells expressing two assays. Multiplexing relies on the robustness of the individual assays and their clear discrimination, further enhancing screening capabilities in an attempt to block proteolytic events required for viral infectivity and spread.\\ntitle: A Single-Cell Platform for Monitoring Viral Proteolytic Cleavage in Different Cellular Compartments', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 127}), Document(page_content='abstract: The global COVID-19 pandemic disrupted learning environments, adding significantly to an already-challenging time for adolescents.

To accommodate the rising number of critically ill patients, new intensive care units were formed in several hospitals. Here we describe the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in a newly formed COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary cardiac center in Sofia, Bulgaria. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to Sveta Ekaterina University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, between November 4th, 2020 and January 6th, 2021. Data were collected from electronic and written patient records and charts. Results: We identified 38 critical care patients admitted with respiratory failure and treated with mechanical ventilation at our COVID-19 ICU during this period. The median age was 66 (IQR 57-76, range 27-89) and 74% were male. Most patients, 36 (95%), had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Overall, 27 (71%) patients had a concomitant cardiac disease other than hypertension and 24% were recent cardiac surgical patients. Inotropic support was required in 29 (76%) patients, renal replacement therapy in 12 (32%) patients and prone positioning and ECMO were used in 5 (13%) and 2 (5%) patients respectively. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.5 (IQR 5-14) days overall and 9 (IQR 6-13) days for survivors. At 30-days 28 (74%) of patients had died. Overall, 32 (84%) patients died in hospital and only 6 (16%) patients were discharged home. Conclusions: During the first major surge of COVID-19 cases in Bulgaria, despite the wave arriving later than in other countries, the healthcare system was largely unprepared. In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was very high at 85%. There may be several factors contributing to these results, namely the predominance of cardiovascular comorbidities in our patient population, the strained ICU capacity and the lack of medical personnel to provide adequate intensive care to such complex patients.\\ntitle: Presentation, characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Bulgaria', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 129}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality The success of convalescent plasma therapy is based on the transfused plasma had high concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and on the safe preparation of serum to eliminate potential risk factors, such as the transmission of viruses via transfusion Methods: Five patients laboratory confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) classified like of care and seriously non-ventilated patients with moderate hypoxemia were received 300 mL convalescent plasma treatment Each donation was tested for antibody titers IgG class anti-SARS-CoV-2 by UMELISA The transfused plasma units had an average antibody titer of 836 00 ± 617 155 The time interval between the onset of symptoms and transfusion was 9 days (7 20± 3) Before and after each transfusion, clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated Results: At 24-hour after the plasma transfusion, oxygen partial pressure increased from medium value of 70 4 to 101 6 mm Hg, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase enzyme values decreased in 3 of 5 patients;however, the ferritin values increased in all the patients Post-transfusion hospital discharge time was from 48 hours to 12 days and the SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative between 3 and 5 days No adverse transfusion reactions were reported Conclusion: This report emphasis about the efficacy and security of convalescent plasma transfusion to care and seriously non-ventilated patients infected like a preventive therapy for severe respiratory distress for SARS-CoV-2 virus disease © 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas All rights reserved\\ntitle: Convalescent plasma therapy prevents acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with sars-cov-2 virus disease', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 130}), Document(page_content='abstract: The diagnosis and timely treatment of cancer patients should not be compromised during an infectious disease pandemic.

Methods: We invited individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 lasting more than 14 days to participate in an anonymous online questionnaire. Basic demographic data and self-reported symptoms were recorded. Internationally validated instruments including the patient health questionnaire somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom scales (PHQ-SADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and Chadler fatigue scale (CFQ) were used. Results: We analysed responses from 988 participants with self-reported confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive;81%) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested;9%) COVID-19. The majority of respondents were female (88%), white (98%), with a median age of 43.0 (range 15 – 88 years old) and a median BMI of 26.0 (range 16 – 60). At the time of completing this survey, 89% of respondents reported that they have not returned to their pre-COVID-19 level of health. The median number of symptoms reported was 8 (range 0 to 33 symptoms), with a median duration of 12 months (range 1 to 20 months) since time of acute infection. A high proportion of PASC patients reported that they have a moderate or severe limitation in their ability to carry out their usual activities, 38% report their ability to work is severely limited and 33% report a moderate, or higher, level of anxiety or depression. Conclusion: The results of this survey of an Irish cohort with PASC are in line with reports from other settings, and we confirm that patients with PASC reported prolonged, multi-system symptoms which can significantly impact quality of life, affect ability to work and cause significant disability.

In the absence of any successful public or academic campaign for comprehensive or random testing, we have developed a proxy method for synthetic random sampling, based on viral RNA testing of patients who present for elective procedures within a hospital system. We present here an approach under multilevel regression and poststratification to collecting and analyzing data on viral exposure among patients in a hospital system and performing statistical adjustment that has been made publicly available to estimate true viral incidence and trends in the community.

This study aims to clarify the effect of exercise. METHODS Using the data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2016, we identified 1572 elderly people with diabetes for this cross-sectional population-based study. Demographic characteristics, health conditions, comorbidities, HRQoL, and medical resource were compared among four groups (no exercise, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise, and high-intensity exercise). RESULTS The mean age of all participants was between 71.5 and 73.3 years. Male participants with higher education performed more exercise than their counterparts. The moderate- and high-intensity groups reported better general health condition than the no exercise group. Depression and worse health were more common in the no exercise group. Participants in the moderate-intensity exercise group had lower risk for depression than those in the no exercise group (adjusted odds ratio: 0.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.92) after adjusting for demographic characteristics, health conditions, and comorbidities, whereas participants in the low- and high-intensity exercise did not have a lower risk. The no exercise group had the highest proportions of emergency, hospitalization, and total healthcare visits. CONCLUSIONS Exercise is associated with better HRQoL, and lack of exercise is associated with higher medical resource use in elderly people with diabetes.

The COVID-19 pandemic has massively increased the rate of ALI incidence. The pathogenesis of ALI involves tissue damage from invading microbes and, in severe cases, the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). This study aimed to develop a therapy to normalize the excess production of inflammatory cytokines and promote tissue repair in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Based on our previous studies, we tested the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and BTP-2 therapies. IGF-I was selected, because we and others have shown that elevated inflammatory cytokines suppress the expression of growth hormone receptors in the liver, leading to a decrease in the circulating IGF-I. IGF-I is a growth factor that increases vascular protection, enhances tissue repair, and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is also required to produce anti-inflammatory 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. BTP-2, an inhibitor of cytosolic calcium, was used to suppress the LPS-induced increase in cytosolic calcium, which otherwise leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. We showed that LPS increased the expression of the primary inflammatory mediators such as toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4), IL-1ß, interleukin-17 (IL-17), TNF-&#945;, and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), which were normalized by the IGF-I + BTP-2 dual therapy in the lungs, along with improved vascular gene expression markers. The histologic lung injury score was markedly elevated by LPS and reduced to normal by the combination therapy. In conclusion, the LPS-induced increases in inflammatory cytokines, vascular injuries, and lung injuries were all improved by IGF-I + BTP-2 combination therapy.\\ntitle: The Effects of Insulin-Like Growth Factor I and BTP-2 on Acute Lung Injury', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 142}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruption in the health care deliveries and activities worldwide including hospital admission METHOD: We used hospitals discharged coded data from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 to examine the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the pattern of cardiovascular admission among Hamad Medical Corporation hospitals in the State of Qatar RESULTS: In this retrospective observational study, we documented significant changes in the pattern of cardiovascular admissions in our hospitals There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations of various subsets of cardiac disease Admissions for acute myocardial infarction dropped by 31%, acute decompensated dropped by 48%, unstable angina dropped by 79% and arrythmia by 80% Primary percutaneous coronary intervention procedures declined briefly However, the total deaths remained the same despite the increase in mortality rate due to reduced admissions number CONCLUSION: We postulate the fear of contracting the disease and the lock-down mentality during COVID-19 outbreak contribute to reduction of cardiovascular admission to our hospital\\ntitle: The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Cardiovascular Admissions', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 143}), Document(page_content='abstract: Since theoretical models provide data that cannot be otherwise gathered, numerical methods applied to medical devices analysis have emerged as fundamental tool in preclinical development.

METHODS This study is a retrospective review of ED discharge diagnoses obtained from a computerized database, examining the 4-week period starting March 28 for the years 2001-2004. We obtained the discharge diagnosis, age and visit date for each ED patient during the relevant time intervals, then compared visit data from 2003 and 2004 with a baseline derived from the average number of visits during 2001 and 2002. We constructed groupings based on age and respiratory-illness symptoms. RESULTS During the SARS outbreak in 2003, ED visits declined by 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-24%) over the 4-week study period. The greatest reduction was for combined infant and toddler visits (69%; 95% CI, 58%-79%); these did not recover the following year.

Despite benefits including reduced trauma and recovery time, EIGIs have their own challenges. Remote catheter actuation and challenging anatomical morphology may lead to erroneous endovascular device selections, delays or even complications such as vessel injury. EIGI planning using 3D phantoms would allow interventionists to become familiarized with the patient vessel anatomy by first performing the planned treatment on a phantom under standard operating protocols. In this study the optimal workflow to obtain such phantoms from 3D data for interventionist to practice on prior to an actual procedure was investigated. Patient-specific phantoms and phantoms presenting a wide range of challenging geometries were created. Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) data was uploaded into a Vitrea 3D station which allows segmentation and resulting stereo-lithographic files to be exported. The files were uploaded using processing software where preloaded vessel structures were included to create a closed-flow vasculature having structural support. The final file was printed, cleaned, connected to a flow loop and placed in an angiographic room for EIGI practice. Various Circle of Willis and cardiac arterial geometries were used. The phantoms were tested for ischemic stroke treatment, distal catheter navigation, aneurysm stenting and cardiac imaging under angiographic guidance.

However, a meta-analysis on the efficacy of steroids in treating these coronavirus infections is lacking. (2) Purpose: We assessed a methodological criticism on the quality of previous published meta-analyses and the risk of misleading conclusions with important therapeutic consequences. We also examined the evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in SARS, MERS and COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were used to identify studies published until 25 April 2020, that reported associations between steroid use and mortality in treating SARS/MERS/COVID-19. Two investigators screened and extracted data independently. Searches were restricted to studies on humans, and articles that did not report the exact number of patients in each group or data on mortality were excluded. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) under the fixed- and random-effect model. (4) Results: Eight articles (4051 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Among these selected studies, 3416 patients were diagnosed with SARS, 360 patients with MERS, and 275 with COVID-19; 60.3% patients were administered steroids. The meta-analyses including all studies showed no differences overall in terms of mortality (OR 1.152, 95% CI 0.631–2.101 in the random effects model, p = 0.645). However, this conclusion might be biased, because, in some studies, the patients in the steroid group had more severe symptoms than those in the control group. In contrast, when the meta-analysis was performed restricting only to studies that used appropriate adjustment (e.g., time, disease severity), there was a significant difference between the two groups (HR 0.378, 95% CI 0.221–0.646 in the random effects model, p < 0.0001). Although there was no difference in mortality when steroids were used in severe cases, there was a difference among the group with more underlying diseases (OR 3.133, 95% CI 1.670–5.877, p < 0.001).

Occasionally, the traditional methods - such as pelvic gauze packing and the use of metallic thumbtacks - are not effective. When combined with their complications and difficulties, these failures have resulted in numerous creative procedures with which to control this complication. In 1994, the indirect electrocoagulation method, which is performed via a fragment of the rectus abdominis muscle of the abdomen, was introduced to control presacral venous bleeding. METHODS From January 2002 to December 2015, five of 872 patients with rectal cancer and one patient with rectal metastasis of gastric cancer developed presacral venous bleeding, and this technique was used in every case. RESULTS Haemostasis was permanent in all cases. There were no complications such as infection or rebleeding.

Nsp 3 is a multi-functional protein containing a conserved ADP-ribose-1″-phosphatase (ADRP) domain. The crystal structures of the domain from two strains of IBV, M41 (virulent) and Beaudette (avirulent), identified a key difference; M41 contains a conserved triple-glycine motif, whilst Beaudette contains a glycine-to-serine mutation that is predicted to abolish ADRP activity. Although ADRP activity has not been formally demonstrated for IBV nsp 3, Beaudette fails to bind ADP-ribose. The role of ADRP in virulence was investigated by generating rIBVs, based on Beaudette, containing either a restored triple-glycine motif or the complete M41 ADRP domain. Replication in vitro was unaffected by the ADRP modifications and the in vivo phenotype of the rIBVs was found to be apathogenic, indicating that restoration of the triple-glycine motif is not sufficient to restore virulence to the apathogenic Beaudette strain.\\ntitle: The ADRP domain from a virulent strain of infectious bronchitis virus is not sufficient to confer a pathogenic phenotype to the attenuated Beaudette strain', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 157}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background There is growing evidence indicating that children are less affected from COVID-19 Some authors speculate that childhood vaccinations may provide some cross-protection against COVID-19 In this study, our aim was to compare the circulating antibody titers for multiple childhood vaccine antigens, as an indicator of the state of immune memory between patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls, with a specific aim to identify the association between disease severity and antibody titrations which may indicate a protective function related to vaccine or disease induced memory Methods This study is a case-control study including 53 patients with COVID-19 and 40 healthy volunteers COVID-19 severity was divided into three groups: asymptomatic, mild and severe We measured the same set of antibody titers for vaccine antigens, and a set of biochemical and infection markers, in both the case and control groups Results Rubella (p = 0 003), pneumococcus (p = 0 002), and Bordetella pertussis (p &lt; 0 0001) titers were found to be significantly lower in the case group than the control group There was a significant decline in pneumococcus titers with severity of disease (p = 0 021) and a significant association with disease severity for Bordetella pertussis titers (p = 0 014) among COVID patients Levels of AST, procalcitonin, ferritin and D-dimer significantly increased with the disease severity Discussion Our study supports the hypothesis that pre-existing immune memory, as monitored using circulating antibodies, acquired from childhood vaccinations, or past infections confer some protection against COVID-19 Randomized controlled studies are needed to support a definitive conclusion\\ntitle: Is there a link between pre-existing antibodies acquired due to childhood vaccinations or past infections and COVID-19?

When it comes to transitioning from conventional face-to-face examination to fully online assessment, the use of e-learning tools such as Moodle may bring multiple benefits but they could also raise a lot of concerns. One of the main concerns refers to content leakage, which involves the unauthorized distribution of the exam subjects, such as question banks, or sharing the quiz attempts with colleagues. When this happens, it can hinder the integrity of the online exams and their unique content, and of course, it will impact grades. There could be various causes for content leaks, such as lack of supervision or maybe settings incorrectly applied to quizzes. However, these could be some of the contributing factors that are enabling students to cheat. In light of the above, the aim of this paper is straightforward: to identify and outline the most important and feasible key-measures that could be adopted in order to detect and prevent or (at least substantially) decrease cheating during online exams.

Emerging COVID-19 infection, caused by the novel SARS-CoV2, is now a pandemic, bringing a substantial burden to human health. Interferon (IFN), combined with other antivirals and various treatments, has been used to treat and prevent MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 infections. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of IFN-based treatments and combinational therapy with antivirals, corticosteroids, traditional medicine, and other treatments. Major healthcare databases and grey literature were investigated. A three-stage screening was utilized, and included studies were checked against the protocol eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed, followed by narrative data synthesis. Fifty-five distinct studies of SARS-CoV2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were spotted. Our narrative synthesis showed a possible benefit in the use of IFN. A good quality cohort showed lower CRP levels in Arbidol (ARB) + IFN group vs. IFN only group. Another study reported a significantly shorter chest X-ray (CXR) resolution in IFN-Alfacon-1 + corticosteroid group compared with the corticosteroid only group in SARS-CoV patients. In a COVID-19 trial, total adverse drug events (ADEs) were much lower in the Favipiravir (FPV) + IFN-&#945; group compared with the LPV/RTV arm (P = 0.001). Also, nausea in patients receiving FPV + IFN-&#945; regimen was significantly lower (P = 0.03). Quantitative analysis of mortality did not show a conclusive effect for IFN/RBV treatment in six moderately heterogeneous MERS-CoV studies (log OR = -0.05, 95% CI: (-0.71,0.62), I2 = 44.71%). A meta-analysis of three COVID-19 studies did not show a conclusive nor meaningful relation between receiving IFN and COVID-19 severity (log OR = -0.44, 95% CI: (-1.13,0.25), I2 = 31.42%). A lack of high-quality cohorts and controlled trials was observed. Evidence suggests the potential efficacy of several combination IFN therapies such as lower ADEs, quicker resolution of CXR, or a decrease in inflammatory cytokines; Still, these options must possibly be further explored before being recommended in public guidelines. For all major CoVs, our results may indicate a lack of a definitive effect of IFN treatment on mortality.

Purposely curated and aggregated data from individual research groups can fulfil this unmet need, resulting in rich resources for psychiatric research. Methods and analyses: As part of the Cardiff MRC Mental Health Data Pathfinder, we have curated and harmonised phenotypic and genetic information from 15 studies within the MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics to create a new data repository, DRAGON-DATA. To date, DRAGON-DATA includes over 45,000 individuals: adults or children with psychiatric diagnoses, affected probands with family members and individuals who carry a known neurodevelopmental copy number variant (ND-CNV). We have processed the available phenotype information to derive core variables that can be reliably analysed across groups. In addition, all datasets with genotype information have undergone rigorous quality control, imputation, CNV calling and polygenic score generation. Ethics and Dissemination: DRAGON-DATA combines genetic and non-genetic information and is available as a resource for research across traditional psychiatric diagnostic categories. Its structure and governance follow standard UK ethical requirements (at the level of participating studies and the project as a whole) and conforms to principles reflected in the EU data protection scheme (GDPR). Algorithms and pipelines used for data harmonisation are currently publicly available for the scientific community, and an appropriate data sharing protocol will be developed as part of ongoing projects (DATAMIND) in partnership with HDR UK.\\ntitle: DRAGON-Data: A platform and protocol for integrating genomic and phenotypic data across large psychiatric cohorts', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 178}), Document(page_content='abstract: Successful development of a chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 could provide a tool for infection prevention implementable alongside vaccination programmes. Camostat and nafamostat are serine protease inhibitors that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in vitro but have not been characterised for chemoprophylaxis in animal models. Clinically, nafamostat is limited to intravenous delivery and while camostat is orally available, both drugs have extremely short plasma half-lives. This study sought to determine whether intranasal dosing at 5 mg/kg twice daily was able to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected to uninfected Syrian golden hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was above the limits of quantification in both saline- and camostat-treated hamsters 5 days after cohabitation with a SARS-CoV-2 inoculated hamster. However, intranasal nafamostat-treated hamsters remained RNA negative for the full 7 days of cohabitation. Changes in body weight over the course of the experiment were supportive of a lack of clinical symptomology in nafamostat-treated but not saline- or camostat-treated animals. These data are strongly supportive of the utility of intranasally delivered nafamostat for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and further studies are underway to confirm absence of pulmonary infection and pathological changes.\\ntitle: Evaluation of intranasal nafamostat or camostat for SARS-CoV-2 chemoprophylaxis in Syrian golden hamsters', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 179}), Document(page_content='abstract: Covid-19 may have a heterogeneous onset, especially in older age. However, whether and how Covid-19 signs and symptoms may present and aggregate together according to sociodemographic and health factors is unclear, as well as their prognostic value. This work included 981 Covid-19 inpatients who participated in the GeroCovid Observational study. Signs/symptoms at disease onset, sociodemographic, health, cognitive status, and mobility were systematically recorded. Clusters of signs/symptoms were identified through agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The associations of single signs/symptoms and symptom clusters with longer hospitalization (≥16 days) and in-hospital mortality were explored through logistic and Cox regressions. The signs/symptoms most reported in our sample (age 78.3±9.39 years; 49.4% women) were fever (62.5%), cough (45.5%), and dyspnoea (62.7%). Atypical were reported by up to one-third of patients, and delirium by 9.1%. Atypical symptoms were more frequent with advancing age and with lower pre-Covid-19 cognitive and mobility levels. Older men more likely reported respiratory symptoms than women. Dyspnoea (HR=1.47, 95%CI:1.02-2.12), tachypnea (HR=1.53, 95%CI:1.14-2.07), low oxygen saturation (HR=1.95, 95%CI:1.32-2.88) and delirium (HR=1.60, 95%CI:1.13-2.28) were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Four symptom clusters were identified. Compared with the mild respiratory symptoms cluster, the severe clinical impairment cluster was associated with higher mortality (HR=2.57, 95%CI:1.58-4.18). The severe clinical impairment and aspecific symptoms clusters were associated with longer hospitalization (OR=2.38, 95%CI:1.56-3.63, and OR=1.75, 95%CI:1.08-2.83, respectively). Multiple health aspects influence Covid-19 clinical presentation. A symptom clusters approach may help predict adverse health outcomes in older patients.

The research involved 318 young adults (Mean Age: 20.9, SD: 2.47). The research process was conducted through the triangulation of three questionnaires: Piracy Risk Scale, Time Perspective Inventory, and the Values Scale. Based on the data collected, it was noted that piracy is not a rare phenomenon among young people (similar to other e-risks), and it is most common for files related to entertainment to be systematically downloaded. Digital piracy is linked to the level of digital competence, as well as hedonistic and fatalistic attitudes to time and values such as materialism and sense of honour.

The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used in-depth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents. CONCLUSION: CCC staff relied on experience and judgment in coordination with public health information to assist decision-making in the management of enteric illness and outbreaks. Advice and guidance from public health officials to CCC staff needs to be consistent yet flexible so that it may be adapted in a variety of situations and meet regulatory and public health requirements.\\ntitle: Gatekeepers of health: A qualitative assessment of child care centre staff's perspectives, practices and challenges to enteric illness prevention and management in child care centres\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 183}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Background: A 73-years-old-man patient who had a history of Human Immunodefiency Virus (HIV) infection for over 20 years was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

That such supply chains often implicate China, the origin of the pandemic, has also led to claims that trading partners have become too dependent on Chinese supplies. This in turn has led to policy interventions designed to reconfigure supply chains, which if adopted broadly could revise the terms upon which international business operates. A critical evaluation of this policymaker assessment is presented, based on near-time monitoring of medical and food trade disruption induced by government policy, on fine-grained trade data on the pre-pandemic international sourcing patterns of medical goods and medicines by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, on statements from U.S. government health experts before and during the pandemic on the frequency and sources of medicine shortages, and on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s latest evidence on the causes of medicine shortages in 2020.

OBJECTIVES To describe the effect of the national COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa (SA) on the workload and case mix of patients presenting to a district-level emergency centre. METHODS The electronic patient tracking and registration database at Mitchells Plain Hospital, a district-level hospital in Cape Town, was retrospectively analysed. The 5-week lockdown period (27 March - 30 April 2020) was compared with a similar period immediately before the lockdown (21 February - 26 March). A comparison was also made with corresponding time periods during 2018 and 2019. Patient demographics, characteristics, diagnoses and disposition, as well as process times, were compared. RESULTS A total of 26 164 emergency centre visits were analysed (8 297 in 2020, 9 726 in 2019, 8 141 in 2018). There was a reduction of 15% in overall emergency centre visits from 2019 to 2020 (non-trauma 14%, trauma 20%). A 35% decrease was seen between the 2020 lockdown period and the 5-week period before lockdown (non-trauma 33%, trauma 43%), and the reduced number of visits stayed similar throughout the lockdown period. The median age increased by 5 years during the 2020 lockdown period, along with an 8% decrease in patients aged <12 years. High-acuity patients increased by 6% and the emergency centre mortality rate increased by 1%. All process times were shorter during the lockdown period (time to triage -24%, time to consultation -56%, time to disposition decision -29%, time in the emergency centre -20%). CONCLUSIONS The SA national COVID-19 lockdown resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of patients presenting to the emergency centre.

METHODS: In March 2021, an online questionnaire was proposed to adults included in a longitudinal cohort study of previous SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys carried out in the canton of Geneva, which included former participants of a population-based health survey as well as individuals randomly sampled from population registries, and their household members. Questions were asked about COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, reasons for acceptance or refusal and attitudes to vaccination in general. Data on demographic (age, sex, education, income, professional status, living conditions) and health-related characteristics (having a chronic disease, COVID-19 diagnosis, smoking status) were assessed at inclusion in the cohort (December 2020). The overall vaccination acceptance was standardised according to the age, sex, and education distribution in the Geneva population. RESULTS: Overall, 4067 participants (completion rate of 77.4%) responded to the survey between 17 March and 1 April 2021. The mean age of respondents was 53.3 years and 56.0% were women. At the time of the survey, 17.2% of respondents had already been vaccinated with at least one dose or had made an appointment to get vaccinated, and an additional 58.5% intended or rather intended to get vaccinated. The overall acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination standardised to the age, sex and education distribution of the population of Geneva was 71.8%, with a higher acceptance among men than women, older adults compared with younger adults, high-income individuals compared with those with a low income, and participants living in urban and semi-urban areas compared with rural areas. Acceptance was lower among individuals having completed apprenticeships and secondary education than those with tertiary education. The most common reasons reported by participants intending to get vaccinated were the desire to \"get back to normal\", to protect themselves, their community and/or society,and their relatives or friends against the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as the desire to travel. Less than half (45.6%) of participants having children were willing or rather willing to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if it were recommended by public health authorities. CONCLUSION: Although our study found a 71.8% weighted acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, there were noticeable sociodemographic disparities in vaccination acceptance.

Should the lockdown period have been longer (or shorter)? What would have been the benefits of starting to confine the population earlier? To provide some elements of response to these questions, we propose a simple behavior model for the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model has the merit to implement in a pragmatic and insightful way the tradeoff between health and macroeconomic aspects. For a given tradeoff between the assumed cost functions for the economic and health impacts, it is then possible to determine the best lockdown starting date, the best lockdown duration, and the optimal severity levels during and after lockdown. The numerical analysis is based on a standard SEIR model and performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country.

We used the prototype arterivirus, equine arteritis virus (EAV), to gain insight into the structure and function of the replication/transcription complex (RTC) of nidoviruses. RTCs were isolated from EAV-infected cells, and their activity was studied using a newly developed in vitro assay for viral RNA synthesis, which reproduced the synthesis of both viral genome and subgenomic mRNAs. A detailed characterization of this system and its reaction products is described. RTCs isolated from cytoplasmic extracts by differential centrifugation were inactive unless supplemented with a cytosolic host protein factor, which, according to subsequent size fractionation analysis, has a molecular mass in the range of 59-70 kDa. This host factor was found to be present in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Several EAV replicase subunits cosedimented with newly made viral RNA in a heavy membrane fraction that contained all RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. This fraction contained the characteristic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that were previously implicated in EAV RNA synthesis and could be immunolabeled for EAV nonstructural proteins (nsps). Replicase subunits directly involved in viral RNA synthesis (nsp9 and nsp10) or DMV formation (nsp2 and nsp3) exclusively cosedimented with the active RTC.

Some of these new variants have been of health public concern due to their higher infectiousness. We propose a theoretical mathematical model based on differential equations to study the effect of introducing a new, more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population. The mathematical model is formulated in such a way that it takes into account the higher transmission rate of the new SARS-CoV-2 strain and the subpopulation of asymptomatic carriers. We find the basic reproduction number R0 using the method of the next generation matrix. This threshold parameter is crucial since it indicates what parameters play an important role in the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the local stability of the infection-free and endemic equilibrium states, which are potential outcomes of a pandemic. Moreover, by using a suitable Lyapunov functional and the LaSalle invariant principle, it is proved that if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Our study shows that the new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant will prevail and the prevalence of the preexistent variant would decrease and eventually disappear. We perform numerical simulations to support the analytic results and to show some effects of a new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population.\\ntitle: Nonlinear Dynamics of the Introduction of a New SARS-CoV-2 Variant with Different Infectiousness', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 201}), Document(page_content='abstract: A simple and explicit expression of the solution of the SIR epidemiological model of Kermack and McKendrick is constructed in the asymptotic limit of large basic reproduction numbers $ro$.

METHOD: Parents of patients (10-18 yrs) referred to child and adolescent psychiatry participated in an anonymous online survey, approximately six weeks after the first easing of lockdown measures. Parents rated the amount, the content and the psychological impact of their children's media use before, during and after the lockdown. RESULTS: N = 477 parents completed the survey. Patients showed a significant increase in media time during the lockdown (including devices such as mobile, tablet/PC, video game console, TV, and activities such as gaming, social media) and a moderate increase in the negative impact of media use on everyday life. After the lockdown, total media time returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in most patients, but remained slightly higher in males. A worsening of the main psychopathological problem during lockdown was related to elevated media time in children (10-13 yrs), but not in adolescents (14-18 yrs). CONCLUSION: According to parents' retrospective ratings, the increase in screen media time was reversible, and seems to reflect an expected coping strategy during lockdown. However, male patients did not completely return to pre-COVID-19 gaming time, and a small number continued to display excessive gaming.\\ntitle: Media use before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown according to parents in a clinically referred sample in child and adolescent psychiatry: Results of an online survey in Switzerland\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 204}), Document(page_content='abstract: Clinical and anatomical case study of the first death from the novel coronavirus infection in the Novosibirsk Region is presented The matter of etiology, epidemiology COVID-19 are also briefly taken up, data on pathological anatomy in COVID-19 are generalized, with the emphasis on morphological changes in lungs in pneumonia caused by coronavirus infection\\ntitle: Clinical and anatomical case study of the first death from the novel coronavirus infection in the Novosibirsk region', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 205}), Document(page_content='abstract: This dataset provides information related to the outbreak of COVID-19 disease in the United States, including data from each of 3142 US counties from the beginning of the outbreak (January 2020) until September 2020.

In a survey conducted within the first days of implementing social distancing measures in Austria and Germany, we aimed to explore the pathways from threat perception to preferences of defense strategies. We found that anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance were specifically elicited by motivational (vs. epistemic) discrepancies. In a second step, we tested the mediating effect of anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance on preferences regarding personal-social and concrete-abstract defenses. Experiencing anxiety was related to interest in security-related actions, and approach-affect was related to both personal projects and social media use. Participants experiencing reactance were more inclined to pursue personal projects (personal-abstract) and less interested in security-related (personal-concrete) actions. They also showed marginally lower system justification (social-abstract). Additionally, we examined the relationship of loneliness with defense strategies, showing that loneliness was associated with lower system justification and security behaviors. The results suggest that individuals deal with threat in their own ways, mostly depending on affective state and motivational orientation: Anxiety was related to security, approach-state to action (both social and personal), reactance to derogation of the system and disregard for security, while loneliness was associated with inaction.\\ntitle: From anxiety to action—Experience of threat, emotional states, reactance, and action preferences in the early days of COVID-19 self-isolation in Germany and Austria', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 209}), Document(page_content='abstract: Objective: the COVID-19 pandemic has incurred psychological risks for healthcare workers (HCWs).

Previous studies suggested that GPR109A mediates effects of diet-derived phenolic acids such as hippuric acid (HA) and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (3-3-PPA) on promoting bone formation. However, the role of GPR109A in metabolic bone homeostasis and osteoclast differentiation has not been investigated. Using densitometric, bone histologic and molecular signaling analytic methods, we uncovered that bone mass and strength were significantly higher in tibia and spine of standard rodent diet weaned 4-week-old and 6-month-old GPR109A gene deletion (GPR109A-/-) mice, compared to their wild type controls. Osteoclast numbers in bone and in ex vivo bone marrow cell cultures were significantly decreased in GPR109A-/- mice compared to wild type controls. In accordance with these data, CTX-1 in bone marrow plasma and gene expression of bone resorption markers (TNFα, TRAP, Cathepsin K) were significantly decreased in GPR109A-/- mice, while on the other hand, P1NP was increased in serum from both male and female GPR109A-/- mice compared to their respective controls. GPR109A deletion led to suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoclast precursors to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and activity. Indeed, HA and 3-3-PPA substantially inhibited RANKL-induced GPR109A expression and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoclast precursors and osteoclast differentiation. Resultantly, HA significantly inhibited bone resorption and increased bone mass in wild type mice, but had no additional effects on bone in GPR109A-/- mice compared with their respective untreated control mice. These results suggest an important role for GPR109A during osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption mediating effects of HA and 3-3-PPA on inhibiting bone resorption during skeletal development.\\ntitle: GPR109A mediates the effects of hippuric acid on regulating osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in mice.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 211}), Document(page_content='abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important oxidoreductase in the anaerobic metabolic pathway. The role of LDH in arterial stiffness (AS) and 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD10) risk has not been established. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, and observational study evaluated the relationships between the LDH level and AS and CVD10 risk in 12,597 health-examined people (6988 men and 5609 women; mean age, 49.49 years) in China. Brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was used to estimate AS. The Framingham CVD 10-year risk prediction model was used to calculate the CVD10 risk score. RESULTS: In both sexes, an increased LDH level was associated with increased AS and CVD10 (men: β = 0.032, P < 0.001; women: β = 0.025, P < 0.001). Half of the population with a high LDH level (≥172 U/L) showed significantly increased AS and CVD10 risk score. Men and women with baPWV ≥1400 cm/s had a higher LDH level, and the latter was significantly different from that of the group with baPWV <1400 cm/s (men: 176.93±30.99 vs 173.00±33.36, P < 0.001; women: 189.10±34.20 vs 171.39±31.08, P < 0.001).

Low trust in vaccines is attributed to a combination of factors, including lack of understanding, vaccine scares, flawed policies, social media and mistrust of vaccine manufacturers, scientists and decision-makers. The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare societies' vulnerability to new pathogens and the critical role of vaccines (and their acceptability) in containing this and future pandemics. It has also put science at the forefront of the response, with several governments relying on academics to help shape policy and communicate with the public. Against this backdrop, protecting public trust in scientists and scientific output is arguably more important than ever. Yet, conflicts of interest (CoI) in biomedical research remain ubiquitous and harmful, and measures to curb them have had limited success. There is also evidence of bias in industry-sponsored vaccine studies and academics are voicing concerns about the risks of working in a CoI prevalent research area. Here, we set out to challenge established thinking with regard to vaccine confidence, by shifting the gaze from a deficit in public understanding towards probity in research relationships and suggesting an alternative and perhaps complementary strategy for addressing vaccine mistrust.

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50).

METHODS: The Dutch Oncology COVID-19 Consortium (DOCC) registry was launched in March 2020 in 45 hospitals in the Netherlands, primarily to identify risk factors of a severe COVID-19 outcome in patients with cancer. Here, an updated analysis of the registry was performed, and treatment restrictions (e.g., do-not-intubate codes) were studied in relation to COVID-19 outcome in patients with cancer.

Follow-up data of 830 patients could be validated for this analysis. Overall, 230 out of 830 (27.7%) patients died of COVID-19, and 60% of the remaining 600 patients with resolved COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. Patients with haematological malignancies or lung cancer had a higher risk of a fatal outcome than other solid tumours. No correlation between anti-cancer therapies and the risk of a fatal COVID-19 outcome was found.

We provide detailed insights into how loan officers, the key personnel linking the lender to its borrowers, are affected in their performance and adapt their work to the pandemic. We use administrative records of an Indian Microfinance Institution and detailed panel survey data on performance, performed tasks, and work organization to document how the work environment became more challenging during the pandemic. Loan officers operate in a setting where work from home is hard to implement due to the nature of the tasks and technological constraints. The usual performance indicators appear to be mainly driven by external factors such as the nation-wide debt moratorium. Loan officers worked similar hours, but engaged less in planning activities and completed fewer of the usual tasks. Work perceptions and mental health of loan officers reflect these changes, and perceived stress was particularly high during the period of the debt moratorium.\\ntitle: Microfinance loan officers before and during Covid-19: Evidence from India', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 225}), Document(page_content='abstract: The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be completely understood, and detailed SARS-CoV-2 cellular cytopathic effects requires definition.

SARS-CoV-2 induces rapid death associated with profound ultrastructural changes in Vero cells. Type II pneumocytes in lung tissue showed prominent altered features with numerous vacuoles and swollen mitochondria with presence of abundant lipid droplets. The accumulation of lipids was the most striking finding we observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, both in vitro and in the lungs of patients, suggesting that lipids can be involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Methods: This retrospective study examined 61 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, as defined by the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19. All patients were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Union Hospital from Dec 28, 2019 to Feb 22, 2020 and classified into a GGO group or a non-GGO group based on CT results. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the two groups were compared. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis, and using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Forty-five patients were in the GGO group (73.8%, 21 females, 24 males, mean age 54.8±17.8 years) and 16 were in the non-GGO group (26.2%, 11 females, 5 males, mean age 53±14.9 years). The levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-Î³ were greater in the GGO group (all P<0.05). ROC analysis indicated that an elevated level of IL-2 was a good predictor of GGO (area under the curve: 0.716, optimal cutoff: 3.205 pg/mL, 53.8% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that IL-2 level was a significant and independent risk factor for lung GGO (OR: 8.167; 95% CI: 1.63, 40.8; P<0.05). Conclusions: There were correlations between GGO in the lungs of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and the levels of IL-2, IL-4, and INF-Î³. IL-2 was a significant and independent risk factor for GGO.

According to our results the potential of the Smart Specialisation approach (S3) in relation with its place-based strategic prioritisation may have been overlooked in the process. The research is based on a desk review of relevant documents and recent literature in this field; followed by semi-structured interviews with regional planners and practitioners from 10 Spanish regions (autonomous communities); complemented, in a second phase, by the organisation of a focus group to validate the initial results. During our research we identified the main contributions that the Smart Specialisation approach has so far made to the regions (mainly in terms of participative governance and creation of regional ecosystems); and the unanimous perception shared by all the practitioners interviewed that the S3 approach has led to a change of vision in public intervention. However, all of the interviewed regions have confirmed that the drafting of the national recovery and resilience plan lacked an ex-ante alignment with the regional S3 strategies, and failed to consider the existing regional S3 ecosystems. The separation of the recovery logic (based on the operation of public consultations at national level to identify strategic projects) from the S3 logic (based on a strategic prioritisation exercise conducted by each regional ecosystem) confirms that an opportunity may have been missed in the recovery planning process to consolidate the multi-actor, multilevel and place-based S3 approach. Although there is a certain degree of disappointment among regional practitioners as a result of this misalignment, the majority of them believe in the possibility of an ex-post alignment between the two processes, that can protect existing regional shared visions. However, without clear recognition of the S3 ecosystems and the S3 managing bodies, the significant role that Smart Specialisation could play in the recovery process may be at risk.\\ntitle: S3 and Recovery and Resilience Funds: A Case Study Built on the Experience of 10 Spanish Regions\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 228}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: In this work we propose a delay differential equation as a lumped parameter or compartmental infectious disease model featuring high descriptive and predictive capability, extremely high adaptability and low computational requirement. Whereas the model has been developed in the context of COVID-19, it is general enough to be applicable with such changes as necessary to other diseases as well. Our fundamental modeling philosophy consists of a decoupling of public health intervention effects, immune response effects and intrinsic infection properties into separate terms. All parameters in the model are directly related to the disease and its management;we can measure or calculate their values a priori basis our knowledge of the phenomena involved, instead of having to extrapolate them from solution curves. Our model can accurately predict the effects of applying or withdrawing interventions, individually or in combination, and can quickly accommodate any newly released information regarding, for example, the infection properties and the immune response to an emerging infectious disease. After demonstrating that the baseline model can successfully explain the COVID-19 case trajectories observed all over the world, we systematically show how the model can be expanded to account for heterogeneous transmissibility, detailed contact tracing drives, mass testing endeavours and immune responses featuring different combinations of temporary sterilizing immunity, severity-reducing immunity and antibody dependent enhancement.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with cerebrovascular injury, including both ischemia and hemorrhage. We aimed to compare brain MRI findings of COVID-19 associated ARDS with non-COVID-19 ARDS. Methods: A registry of patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 through July 2021 from a hospital network was reviewed. Patients who met criteria for ARDS by Berlin definition and underwent MRI during their hospitalization were included. These patients were matched 1:1 by age and sex with patients who underwent MRI from another registry of patients of ARDS in the same hospital between 2010 and 2018. Cerebrovascular injury was classified as either acute cerebral ischemia (ischemic infarct or hypoxic ischemic brain injury) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Results: Of 13,319 patients with COVID-19 infection, 26 patients had ARDS and MRI. Sixty-six of 678 non-COVID-19 ARDS patients had an MRI and were matched 1:1 by age and sex resulting in 23 matched pairs. The median age was 66 and 59% of patients were male. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS were more likely to have hypertension and chronic kidney disease but otherwise baseline medical characteristics were similar. ARDS severity as determined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio at ICU admission was similar between both groups. No difference was seen in the prevalence of cerebrovascular injury (52% vs 61%, p=0.8), cerebral ischemia (35% vs 43%, p=0.8), ICH (43% vs 48%, p=1.0), or CMBs (43% vs 39% p=1.0) on MRI between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts. However, two unique patterns of injury were seen only among COVID-19 patients: hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (3 patients, 12%) and bilateral cerebral peduncular ischemia with microhemorrhage (2 patients, 8%). Conclusion: Cerebrovascular injury was common in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS without significant frequency difference. However, COVID-19 ARDS had unique neuroimaging patterns that may indicate distinct patterns of brain injury of COVID-19.\\ntitle: Cerebrovascular injury associated with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 231}), Document(page_content='abstract: At present, bioactive glasses (BAGs) are demonstrating promising results in the remineralization of hard tissues. Their bioactive properties can potentially overcome the demineralization effect accompanying orthodontic treatment. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of bioactive glass enhanced orthodontic bonding resins on enamel remineralization, in addition to their antibacterial, ion release and acid neutralization effect. Four databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched. Two hundred and fifty-one full-text articles were screened independently, out of which seven studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Quality appraisal was performed by two independent reviewers. Methodologies used to assess the anti-demineralization effect included Micro-Computed Tomography, Polarized Light Microscopy and Hardness Testing (Knoop and Berkovich). All seven articles confirmed the superior remineralization effect of BAG orthodontic bonding resins compared to their non-BAG counterparts. A proportional relationship was proved between BAG concentrations and increased anti-demineralization effect. The addition of antibacterial agents to BAG does not necessarily improve its anti-demineralization effect. Although studies have confirmed the effectiveness of BAG orthodontic bonding resins on enamel remineralization, there was a degree of heterogeneity across studies due to the lack of an in vitro studies standardized protocol.\\ntitle: The Effect of Bioactive Glass-Enhanced Orthodontic Bonding Resins on Prevention of Demineralization: A Systematic Review.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 232}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background and ObjectivesWhile most maintenance dialysis patients exhibit initial seroresponse to vaccination, concerns remain regarding the durability of this antibody response. This study evaluated immunity over time. Design, setting, participants, and measurementsThis retrospective cohort study included maintenance dialysis patients from a midsize national dialysis provider who received a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series and had at least one antibody titer checked after full vaccination. Immunoglobulin G spike antibodies (SAb-IgG) titers were assessed monthly with routine labs beginning after full vaccination and followed over time; the semiquantitative SAb-IgG titer reported a range between 0 and [≥] 20 U/L. Descriptive analyses compared trends over time by prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. Time-to-event analyses were conducted for the outcome of loss of seroresponse (SAb-IgG < 1 U/L or development of COVID-19). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for additional clinical characteristics of interest. ResultsAmong 1898 maintenance dialysis patients, 1567 (84%) had no prior history of COVID-19. Patients without a history of COVID-19 had declining titers over time. Among 441 BNT162b2/Pfizer recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [5.99-20] U/L in month 1 to 1.30 [0.15-3.59] U/L by month 6. Among 779 mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [20-20] in month 1 to 6.20 [1.74-20] by month 6. The 347 Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen recipients had a lower titer response than mRNA vaccine recipients over all time periods. In time-to-event analyses, Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen and mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients had the shortest and longest time to loss of seroresponse, respectively. The maximum titer reached in the first two months after full vaccination was predictive of the durability of the SAb-IgG seroresponse; patients with SAb-IgG titer 1-19.99 U/L were more likely to have loss of seroresponse compared to patients with SAb-IgG titer [≥] 20 U/L (HR 23.9 [95% CI: 16.1-35.5]).

Here, we characterize the oral mycobiome, including mycobiome-bacteriome interactions, in the setting of remission-induction chemotherapy (RIC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oral samples (n = 299) were prospectively collected twice weekly from 39 AML patients during RIC until neutrophil recovery. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (V4) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing were used to determine bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Intrakingdom and interkingdom network connectivity at baseline (T1) and at midpoint (T3) and a later time point (T6) were assessed via SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference). In this exploratory study, mycobiome α-diversity was not significantly associated with antibiotic or antifungal receipt. However, postchemotherapy mycobiome α-diversity was lower in subjects receiving high-intensity chemotherapy. Additionally, greater decreases in Malassezia levels were seen over time among patients on high-intensity RIC compared to low-intensity RIC (P = 0.003). A significantly higher relative abundance of Candida was found among patients who had infection (P = 0.008), while a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium was found among patients who did not get an infection (P = 0.03). Analyses of intrakingdom and interkingdom relationships at T1, T3, and T6 indicated that interkingdom connectivity increased over the course of IC as bacterial α-diversity diminished. In (to our knowledge) the first longitudinal mycobiome study performed during AML RIC, we found that mycobiome-bacteriome interactions are highly dynamic. Our study data suggest that inclusion of mycobiome analysis in the design of microbiome studies may be necessary to optimally understand the ecological and functional role of microbial communities in clinical outcomes.

Regarding Portugal, a suppression strategy with social distancing was adopted, attempting to break the transmission chains, bending the epidemy curve and reducing mortality. These measures seek to prevent an eventual National Health Service over-running, enforcing the suspension of all elective and non-urgent health care. Despite the success in so far, there is a consensus on the need to recover the previous level of health care provision and further enhance it. The Portuguese National Health Service, as a public, universal access, health care system funded by the State proved, in this context, its importance and relevance to the Portuguese population. However, long standing issues, such as the pre pandemic over long waiting lists for hospital ophthalmology attendance, whose determinants are fully identified but still unmet, emerge amplified from this pandemic. The lack of primary eye care in the National Health Service is a significant bottleneck, placing a huge stress on hospital-based care. An exclusive ophthalmologist's center care was over-runned before pandemic and will be even more so. The optometrist's exclusion from differentiated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary eye care teams remains the main hurdle to overcome and insure universal eye care in Portugal.

METHODS Data were collected retrospectively on consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed acute focal brain ischaemia (between 1 March and 19 April 2020) at a tertiary university hospital in Madrid (Spain). RESULTS During the study period, 1594 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found 22 patients with ischaemic stroke (1.38%), 6 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 16 patients were included in the study (15 cases of ischaemic stroke and one case of transient ischaemic attack). Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 9 (interquartile range: 16), and mean (standard deviation) age was 73 years (12.8). Twelve patients (75%) were men. Mean time from COVID-19 symptom onset to stroke onset was 13 days. Large vessel occlusion was identified in 12 patients (75%). We detected elevated levels of D-dimer in 87.5% of patients and C-reactive protein in 81.2%. The main aetiology was atherothrombotic stroke (9 patients, 56.3%), with the predominant subtype being endoluminal thrombus (5 patients, 31.2%), involving the internal carotid artery in 4 cases and the aortic arch in one. The mortality rate in our series was 44% (7 of 16 patients). CONCLUSIONS In patients with COVID-19, the most frequent stroke aetiology was atherothrombosis, with a high proportion of endoluminal thrombus (31.2% of patients).

Method: A sample of 45 young female rhythmic gymnasts from a competitive team (age = 10.5 ± 1.8 years, height = 144.1 ± 10.6 cm, weight 38.2 ± 8.9 kg, peak height velocity (PHV) = 12.2 ± 0.6 years) participated in the study. The participants were randomly allocated into the control group (CG) and experimental group (EG) and completed pre-tests and post-tests of specific CS tests using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). The CS was assessed by the bent knee fall out (BKFO), the active straight leg raise (ASLR) tests and the pelvic tilt test, all performed on the right and left sides. The EG (n = 23) performed an eight-week functional CST program based on rhythmic gymnastics (RG) technical requirements added to the traditional RG training sessions. Meanwhile, the CG (n = 22) received the traditional RG training sessions. Results: Mixed model analysis showed non-significant interaction effects; however, the ANOVA omnibus test showed a time effect (p < 0.05) in right BKFO (F(1,42) = 4.60; p = 0.038) and both pelvic tilt tests (right F(1,42) = 22.01, p < 0.001; left F(1,42) = 19.13, p < 0.001). There were non-significant interaction effects. The fixed effects estimated parameters for right BKFO showed that both groups had less pressure variation after intervention compared with pre-intervention (β = −1.85 mmHg, 95%CI = [−3.54 to −0.16], t42 = −2.14, p = 0.038). Furthermore, the left pelvic tilt (β = 37.0 s, 95%CI = [20.4 to 53.6], t(42) = 4.37, p < 0.001) improved 8.9 s more than the right pelvic tilt (β = 28.1 s, 95%CI = [16.3 to 39.8], t(42) = 4.69, p < 0.001) considering both groups together.

It is difficult to diagnose, partly due to its relative rarity, its multiple and various clinical manifestations (different from 'conventional' stroke, and often mimicking other acute neurological conditions), and because it is often challenging to obtain and interpret optimal and timely brain imaging. Although CVT can result in death or permanent disability, it generally has a favourable prognosis if diagnosed and treated early. Neurologists involved in stroke care therefore also need to be aware of the treatments for CVT (with varying degrees of supporting evidence): the mainstay is prompt anticoagulation but patients who deteriorate despite treatment can be considered for endovascular procedures (endovascular thrombolysis or thrombectomy) or neurosurgery (decompressive craniotomy).

RECENT FINDINGS: In the 21st century, there have already been several outbreaks of infectious diseases that have led to mass casualties creating ICU strain, providing multiple opportunities for hospitals and hospital systems to prepare their ICUs for future events. Unfortunately, the sheer scale and rapidity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to overwhelming strain on every aspect of ICU disaster preparedness. Yet, by analyzing experiences of hospitals throughout the first 7 months of the current pandemic in the areas of infection control, equipment preparedness, staffing strategies, ICU spatial logistics as well as acute and postacute treatment, various important lessons have already emerged that will prove critical for successful future ICU preparedness.

We assessed whether a percutaneous device that reduces the diameter of the coronary sinus improved outcomes across multiple endpoints in a phase II trial. METHODS We conducted a novel analysis performed as a post hoc efficacy analysis of the COSIRA (Coronary Sinus Reducer for Treatment of Refractory Angina) trial, which enrolled patients with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class 3-4 refractory angina. We used four domains: symptoms (CCS Angina Scale), functionality (total exercise duration), ischaemia (imaging) and health-related quality of life. For all domains, we specified a meaningful threshold for change. The primary endpoint was defined as a probability of ≥80% that the reducer exceeded the meaningful threshold on two or more domains (group-level analysis) or that the average efficacy score in the reducer group exceeded the sham control group by at least two points (patient-level analysis). RESULTS We randomised 104 participants to either a device that narrows to coronary sinus (n=52) or a sham implantation (n=52). The reducer group met the prespecified criteria for concordance at the group level and demonstrated improvement in symptoms (0.59 CCS grade, 95% credible interval (CrI)=0.22 to 0.95), total exercise duration (+27.9%, 95% CrI=2.8% to 59.8%) and quality of life (stability +11.2 points, 95% CrI=3.3 to 19.1; perception +11.0, 95% CrI=3.3 to 18.7). CONCLUSIONS The reducer concordantly improved symptoms, functionality and quality of life compared with a sham intervention in patients with angina unsuitable for coronary revascularisation. Concordant analysis such as this one can help interpret early phase trials and guide the decision to pursue a clinical programme into a larger confirmatory trial.

Previous VC evidence has been the subject of small-scale projects and evaluations. Technology Enabled Care Cymru is an all-Wales digital service and rolls out digital interventions and evaluates on large scales, thus capturing representative data sets across Wales, and therefore a wide range of National Health Service (NHS) specialties. OBJECTIVE: To extract and analyse narrative feedback from patients and clinicians using the NHS Wales VC Service for 6 months (September 2020 to March 2021). DESIGN: A coding reliability approach of a cross-sectional study was conducted. SETTING: From all health boards across Wales. PARTICIPANTS: NHS patients and clinicians across primary, secondary and community care settings in Wales. RESULTS: Data were captured on benefits, challenges and sustainability of VC. A coding reliability analysis was used with six domain summaries materialising to include: ‘The Ease of VC’; ‘The Personal Touches’; ‘The Benefits of VC’; ‘The Challenges of VC’; ‘Technical Quality’; and ‘Recommendations & Future Use’. An additional 17 subdomains are included. Direct quotations from patients and clinicians are provided for context. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 22 978 participants were included. These data help demonstrate that NHS remote service delivery, via the method of VC, can be highly satisfactory, well accepted and clinically suitable yielding many benefits. Despite this, the data are not without its challenges surrounding engagement and suitability for VC. The NHS Wales VC Service rolled out and evaluated at scale and demonstrates that VC has potential for long-term sustainability. For the future, use a ‘blended approach’ for NHS appointments that are clinically judged and centred on patient choice.\\ntitle: Digital NHS Wales: a coding reliability analysis based on the voices of 22 978 patients and clinicians on the benefits, challenges and sustainability of video consulting', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 245}), Document(page_content='abstract: We consider whether one can forecast the emergence of variants of concern in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and similar pandemics.

Although their role in infection diseases is not completely known, they can exert double functions in the infected cell, by mediating the virus infection and/or regulating the immunity-related gene targets through complex networks of virus-host cell interactions. In this systematic review, the Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, Lilacs, Scielo, and EBSCO databases were searched for research articles published until October 22nd, 2020 that focused on describing the role, function, and/or association of miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 human infection and COVID-19. Following the PRISMA 2009 protocol, 29 original research articles were selected. Most of the studies reported miRNA data based on the genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates and computational prediction analysis. The latter predicted, by at least one independent study, 1266 host miRNAs to target the viral genome. Thirteen miRNAs were identified by four independent studies to target SARS-CoV-2 specific genes, suggested to act by interfering with their cleavage and/or translation process. The studies selected also reported on viral and host miRNAs that targeted host genes, on the expression levels of miRNAs in biological specimens of COVID-19 patients, and on the impact of viral genome mutations on miRNA function. Also, miRNAs that regulate the expression levels of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins, which are critical for the virus entrance in the host cells, were reported. In conclusion, despite the limited number of studies identified, based on the search terms and eligibility criteria applied, this systematic review provides evidence on the impact of miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Although most of the reported viral/host miRNAs interactions were based on in silico prediction analysis, they demonstrate the relevance of the viral/host miRNA interaction for viral activity and host responses. In addition, the identified studies highlight the potential use of miRNAs as therapeutic targets against COVID-19, and other viral human diseases (This review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (#CRD42020199290).\\ntitle: The role of microRNAs in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells: a systematic review', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 249}), Document(page_content='abstract: The pedicled anterolateral thigh flap, with or without the vastus lateralis muscle, has been described for pelvic exenteration defect reconstruction.

We assessed the effects of adoptive transfer of MSCs in acid aspiration acute lung injury and explored the role of long pentraxin PTX3. METHODS: We conducted a prospective experimental interventional study on wild-type (WT) and PTX3-deficient (PTX3(−/−)) mice. Acute lung injury was induced in WT and PTX3(−/−) mice by instillation of hydrochloric acid into the right bronchus. One hour later, animals received intraperitoneal sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), WT-MSCs (1 × 10(6)) or PTX3(−/−)-MSCs (1 × 10(6)). Twenty-four hours after injury, we measured the effects of treatments on arterial blood gases, wet/dry lung weight (W/D), CT scan analysis of lung collapse, neutrophils, TNFα and CXCL1 in bronchoalveolar lavage, and plasma PTX3. d-dimer was assayed in 1 week and OH-proline in 2 weeks to track the fibrotic evolution. RESULTS: In 24 h, in comparison to PBS, WT-MSCs improved oxygenation and reduced W/D and alveolar collapse. These effects were associated with decreased concentrations of alveolar neutrophils and cytokines. WT-MSCs increased d-dimer concentration and decreased OH-proline levels, too. Treatment with PTX3(−/−)-MSCs ameliorated oxygenation, W/D, and alveolar TNFα, though to a lesser extent than WT-MSCs. PTX3(−/−)-MSCs did not improve lung collapse, neutrophil count, CXCL1, d-dimer, and OH-proline concentrations. The protective effects of WT-MSCs were dampened by lack of endogenous PTX3, too. CONCLUSIONS: In acid aspiration acute lung injury, MSCs improve pulmonary function and limit fibrosis by fine-tuning inflammation. The role of PTX3 in determining MSCs’ effects might merit further scrutiny.

In contrast, epidemic modelling of marine ecosystems is a bit behind, and compartmental models have been introduced only recently. One of the reasons is that many epidemic processes in terrestrial ecosystems can be described through a contact process, while modelling marine epidemics is more subtle in many cases. Here we present a model describing disease outbreaks caused by parasites in bivalve populations. The SIRP model is a multicompartmental model with four compartments, three of which describe the different states of the host, susceptible (i.e. healthy), S, infected, I, and removed (dead), R, and one compartment for the parasite in the marine medium, P, written as a 4-dimensional dynamical system. Even if this is the simplest model one can write to describe this system, it is still too complicated for both direct analytical manipulation and direct comparison with experimental observations, as it depends on four parameters to be fitted. We show that it is possible to simplify the model, including a reduction to the standard SIR model if the parameters fulfil certain conditions. The model is validated with available data for the recent Mass Mortality Event of the noble pen shell Pinna nobilis, a disease caused by the parasite Haplosporidium pinnae, showing that the reduced SIR model is able to fit the data. So, we show that a model in which the species that suffers the epidemics (host) cannot move, and contagion occurs through parasites, can be reduced to the standard SIR model that represents epidemic transmission between mobile hosts. The fit indicates that the assumptions made to simplify the model are reasonable in practice, although it leads to an indeterminacy in three of the original parameters.\\ntitle: Modelling Parasite-produced Marine Diseases: The case of the Mass Mortality Event of Pinna nobilis', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 258}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on people who inject drugs (PWID) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

METHODS: People who had ever injected psychoactive drugs were recruited to the UAM Survey by specialist drug/alcohol services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From June 2020, in addition to providing a dried blood spot sample and completing the UAM behavioural questionnaire, participants were asked to complete an enhanced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) questionnaire.

The greatest reductions were found for the elements of chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), manganese (Mn), and Zinc (Zn), consistent with the industrial structure of Baoji. The mass concentrations of most elements showed obvious reductions when the government post-alerted the industries to reduce the operations and production.

It was reported by some that Chinese herbs played an important role in the treatment of SARS patients. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the possible effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for SARS patients. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the following electronic databases for reports of randomised controlled trials: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to September 2005); EMBASE (1990 to December 2004); and Chinese Biomedical Literature (lssue 2, 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for diagnosed SARS patients were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted the data from each trial. We extracted dichotomous and continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous data, relative risk (RR) was used. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model if heterogeneity existed between studies. If no heterogeneity was detected between the studies, we used the fixed effects model. Using the Z score and the chi square statistic with significance being set at p < 0.05 tested heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We finally included twelve randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized controlled trial. A total of 654 SARS patients and 12 Chinese herbs were identified. We did not find Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines decreased morbidity versus Western medicines alone. Two herbs may improve symptoms. Five herbs may improve lung infiltrate absorption. Four herbs may decrease the dosage of corticosteroids. Three herbs may improve the quality of life of SARS patients. One herb may shorten the length of stay in hospital. Only two trials reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines made no difference in decreasing morbidity versus Western medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life, and lung infiltrate absorption and decrease the corticosteroid dosage for SARS patients. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials.

Although non-compliance research during pandemics has typically focused on concurrent correlates, less is known about how prior social and psychological risk factors are associated with non-compliance during pandemics. OBJECTIVE: This paper leverages a prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to describe patterns of non-compliance with COVID- 19 related public health measures in young adults and to identify which characteristics increase the risk of non-compliance. METHODS: Data came from an ongoing cohort study in Zurich, Switzerland (n=737). Non-compliance with public health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20. Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although non-compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2 meters apart) was relatively higher. RESULTS: Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures, was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a nonmigrant background. Non-compliance was higher in young adults who had previously scored high on indicators of \"antisocial potential,\" including low acceptance of moral rules, pre-pandemic legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control, engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with low trust, including in the government\\'s measures for fighting the virus, also complied less. CONCLUSIONS: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information. For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or nudging may increase compliance.

The etiology of severe pneumonia is complex and includes the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since 2012, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) has required screening for MERS-CoV for all cases of severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. We aimed to screen Hajj pilgrims admitted to healthcare facilities in 2013 with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for MERS-CoV and to determine other etiologies. METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from all pilgrims admitted to 15 healthcare facilities in the cities of Makkah and Medina, Saudi Arabia, who were diagnosed with severe CAP on admission, presenting with bilateral pneumonia. The medical records were reviewed to collect information on age, gender, nationality, and patient outcome. Samples were screened for MERS-CoV by PCR, and a respiratory multiplex array was used to detect up to 22 other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria; they were predominantly elderly (mean age 58.6 years, range 25–83 years) and male (68.4%), and all were from developing countries. Fourteen of the 38 patients died (36.8%). MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Other respiratory pathogens were detected in 26 (68.4%) samples. Of these, bacterial pathogens were detected in 84.6% (22/26) and viruses in 80.7% (21/26). Twenty-one (80.7%) samples were positive for more than one respiratory pathogen and 17 (65.3%) were positive for both bacteria and viruses. The most common respiratory virus was human rhinovirus, detected in 57.7% of the positive samples, followed by influenza A virus (23.1%) and human coronaviruses (19.2%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria, detected in 57.7% and 53.8%, respectively, of the positive samples, followed by Moraxella catarrhalis (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV was not the cause of severe CAP in any of the hospitalized pilgrims investigated.

The focus on COVID-19 diagnosis for these reasons has led to difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases. Vasculitis is a very difficult disease group due to its multi-organ involvement and different clinical courses. Due to its radiological properties, there the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 can be difficult. A 65-year-old female patient was admitted with a complaint of dry cough, shortness of breath when walking and chest pain. The patient was examined many times for COVID-19, both in our hospital and in other clinics, and for this reason, the diagnosis of vasculitis was delayed. A diagnosis of vasculitis should be kept in mind in patients with prolonged and multi-systemic symptoms when examined with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of safinamide on NMS burden in PD. SAFINONMOTOR (an open-label study of the effectiveness of safinamide on non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease patients) is a prospective open-label single-arm study conducted in five centers from Spain. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (V1) to the end of the observational period (6 months) (V4) in the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) total score. Between May/2019 and February/2020 50 patients were included (age 68.5 ± 9.12 years; 58% females; 6.4 ± 5.1 years from diagnosis). At 6 months, 44 patients completed the follow-up (88%). The NMSS total score was reduced by 38.5% (from 97.5 ± 43.7 in V1 to 59.9 ± 35.5 in V4; p < 0.0001). By domains, improvement was observed in sleep/fatigue (−35.8%; p = 0.002), mood/apathy (−57.9%; p < 0.0001), attention/memory (−23.9%; p = 0.026), gastrointestinal symptoms (−33%; p = 0.010), urinary symptoms (−28.3%; p = 0.003), and pain/miscellaneous (−43%; p < 0.0001). Quality of life (QoL) also improved with a 29.4% reduction in the PDQ-39SI (from 30.1 ± 17.6 in V1 to 21.2 ± 13.5 in V4; p < 0.0001). A total of 21 adverse events in 16 patients (32%) were reported, 5 of which were severe (not related to safinamide). Dyskinesias and nausea were the most frequent (6%).

EOS notably affect asthmatic response by generating several lipid mediators. Mice have been utilized in hopes of defining new pharmacological targets to treat asthma. However, many pinpointed targets in mice did not translate into clinics, underscoring that key differences exist between the two species. In this study, we compared the ability of human (h) and mouse (m) EOS to biosynthesize key bioactive lipids derived from arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). hEOS were isolated from the blood of healthy subjects and mild asthmatics, while mEOSs were differentiated from the bone marrow. EOSs were treated with fatty acids and lipid mediator biosynthesis assessed by LC-MS/MS. We found that hEOS biosynthesized leukotriene (LT) C(4) and LTB(4) in a 5:1 ratio while mEOS almost exclusively biosynthesized LTB(4). The biosynthesis of the 15-lipoxygenase (LO) metabolites 15-HETE and 12-HETE also differed, with a 15-HETE:12-HETE ratio of 6.3 for hEOS and 0.727 for mEOS. EOS biosynthesized some specialized pro-resolving mediators, and the levels from mEOS were 9-times higher than those of hEOS. In contrast, hEOS produced important amounts of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) and its congeners from EPA and DHA, a biosynthetic pathway that was up to ~100-fold less prominent in mEOS. Our data show that hEOS and mEOS biosynthesize the same lipid mediators but in different amounts. Compared to asthmatics, mouse models likely have an amplified involvement of LTB(4) and specialized pro-resolving mediators and a diminished impact of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol and its congeners.\\ntitle: Human and Mouse Eosinophils Differ in Their Ability to Biosynthesize Eicosanoids, Docosanoids, the Endocannabinoid 2-Arachidonoyl-glycerol and Its Congeners', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 268}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPD) has been repeatedly recommended for the clinical treatment of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in multiple provinces throughout China. A possible complication of COVID-19 lung involvement is pulmonary fibrosis, which causes chronic breathing difficulties and affects the patient's quality of life. Therefore, there is an important question regarding whether QFPD can alleviate the process of pulmonary fibrosis and its potential mechanisms. To explore this issue, this study demonstrated the anti-pulmonary fibrosis activity and mode of action of QFPD in vivo and in vitro pulmonary fibrosis models and network pharmacology. The results showed that QFPD effectively ameliorated the bleomycin-induced inflammation and collagen deposition in mice and significantly improved the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In addition, QFPD inhibited bleomycin-induced M2 polarization of macrophages in pulmonary tissues. An in-depth study of the mechanism of QFPD in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis based on network pharmacology and molecular simulation revealed that SRC was the main target of QFPD and sitosterol (a key compound in QFPD). QFPD and sitosterol regulate the EMT process and M2 polarization of macrophages by inhibiting the activation of SRC, thereby alleviating pulmonary fibrosis in mice. COVID-19 infection might produce severe fibrosis, and antifibrotic therapy with QFPD may be valuable in preventing severe neocoronavirus disease in patients with IPF, which could be a key factor explaining the role of QFPD in the treatment of COVID-19.\\ntitle: Effect and Mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction in the Management of Pulmonary Fibrosis and COVID-19\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 269}), Document(page_content='abstract: The role of contaminated clothing in the transmission of influenza A virus during an epidemic period was investigated by examining the recovery of infectious influenza virus from experimentally virus-contaminated clothing, which had been subejected to routine wearing and washing for several months or years. The amount of infectious virus recovered from the nine types of clothing decreased with time and was shown to differ widely between clothing samples, when the contaminated clothing samples were maintained in uncovered glass Petri dishes in a safety cabinet under air blowing. These results indicate a dependence of virus transmissibility on the nature of the contaminated clothes. The difference in recovery was shown to have no significant correlation with the thickness or the materials of the clothing; however, a correlation was observed with the residual amount of water in the deposited virus preparation on the test clothing.\\ntitle: Survival of influenza A virus on contaminated student clothing', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 270}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background The current management practices for patients with COVID-19 consist of infection prevention and supportive care.

There were three intervention subgroups (group A) (n = 45), which included those who received chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only (A1), those who received chloroquine or HCQ in combination with azithromycin (A2), and those who received chloroquine or HCQ in combination with antiviral drugs with or without azithromycin (A3), as well as one supportive care group (group B) (n = 48). The primary and secondary endpoints were achieving negative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR samples within five and 12 days from the start of the intervention, respectively. Results A median time of three days (interquartile range (IQR): 2.00-6.50) is needed from the time of starting the intervention/supportive care to the first negative PCR sample. There was no statistically significant difference neither between the percentage of patients in the intervention group and the supportive care group who achieved the primary or secondary endpoint nor in the median time needed to achieve the first negative PCR sample (p > 0.05).

Although some artificially synthesized MAWs have deleterious effects, there is still a lack of a strategy for the classification of non-occurring sequences as potentially malicious or benign. In this work, by using Markovian models with multiple-testing correction, we reveal significant absent oligomers, which are statistically expected to exist. This suggests that their absence is due to negative selection. We survey genomes and proteomes covering the diversity of life and find thousands of significant absent sequences. Common significant MAWs are often mono- or dinucleotide tracts, or palindromic. Significant viral MAWs are often restriction sites and may indicate unknown restriction motifs. Surprisingly, significant mammal genome MAWs are often present, but rare, in other mammals, suggesting that they are suppressed but not completely forbidden. Significant human MAWs are frequently present in prokaryotes, suggesting immune function, but rarely present in human viruses, indicating viral mimicry of the host. More than one-fourth of human proteins are one substitution away from containing a significant MAW, with the majority of replacements being predicted harmful.

Standard operating procedures (SOP) for nebulization are neither uniform throughout Germany nor available in all federal states. Standardized recommendations with respect to which nebulizer type should be used are missing. The aerosol output as well as the drug deposition rates of jet and mesh nebulizers, however, differ considerably. Mesh devices can achieve a threefold higher lung deposition. Their use in emergency departments has also been shown to be associated with a better patient outcome when compared to jet nebulizers. OBJECTIVE: This survey was designed to evaluate the type of nebulizer used in the south German rescue services. Special attention was paid to the influence of existing SOP on the decision to perform nebulization during emergency treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 4800 emergency paramedics working in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate received a questionnaire with a total of 17 questions on the implementation of drug nebulization in the daily practice. RESULTS: Despite the existence of more efficient nebulizer types, the jet nebulizer was by far the most frequently used nebulizer in the south German rescue services. The deposition rates of both the jet and mesh nebulizers were considerably overestimated by most respondents; however, 77.5% of all respondents could not give any information about the deposition rates of the mesh nebulizer. Only two thirds of all respondents carried out nebulization treatment on the basis of SOP. The implementation of SOP, however, was pivotal to the application of nebulization during emergencies. If SOP were in place,76.9% of the responders used aerosol treatment compared to 23.1% when there were none. The perceived safety when using nebulization during emergencies was also significantly higher (p = 0.013) when SOP were implemented. CONCLUSION: The exclusive use of mesh nebulizers could standardize the treatment of emergency patients in the south German rescue services. The use of mesh devices might possibly improve patient outcomes, even if clinical studies are still lacking. Nebulizer treatment differs between the federal states. A comprehensive implementation of SOP for nebulization treatment might support this process and could increase the application frequency and the perceived safety of nebulization during emergencies. A better training of paramedic personnel could improve the knowledge of aerosols as a treatment option for emergency patients and help to classify the advantages and disadvantages of the different aerosol generators available.\\ntitle: Vernebelung von Notfallmedikamenten im süddeutschen Rettungsdienst', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 275}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID‐19) outbreak as a pandemic. This led many governments to place restrictions on population movement to aid in pandemic control. These restrictions were expected to produce some type of impact on the daily lives of children and their families. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID‐19 on 24‐h movement behaviours among Saudi children aged 6–12 years, during the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey of Saudi parents (n = 1021) was conducted between 1 October to 11 November 2020 to gather information about the impact of the COVID‐19 outbreak on children's 24‐h movement behaviours, parent and child factors that may be associated with movement behaviours, and perceived changes in children's movement behaviours. RESULTS: Only 3.4% of Saudi children met all components of 24‐h movement guidelines. Compared with before COVID‐19, children's PA levels declined, they slept more, and their use of electronic screen devices significantly increased. The perceived changes in PA and SB were more unfavourable among girls than boys. Children of older parents, mothers, and those with lower education levels and lower monthly incomes were more likely to meet 24‐h movement guidelines. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 virus outbreak unfavourably affected Saudi children's movement behaviours, more specifically, girls, which should be taken into account in future research.

METHODS: We used Google Trends, a publicly available database to access search query data in systematic and quantitative fashion, to search for key terms related to clinical imaging. We queried the search volume for multiple imaging modalities, identified the most common terms, extracted data for the United States over the time range from August 1, 2016 to August 1, 2020. Results were given in relative terms, using the Google metric \\'search volume index\\'.

Blood samples were screened using the ELISAs, and confirmed using the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). RESULTS: Among 394 792 blood donors, 733 tested TPPA and TRUST positive (active infection), and 728 tested only TPPA positive (historical infection). The overall prevalence of syphilis seropositivity was 370.1 per 100 000 (95% CI 351.1 to 389.0 per 100 000); the prevalence of active infection was 185.7 per 100 000 (95% CI 172.2 to 199.1 per 100 000). People aged ≥45 years displayed a prevalence of 621.8 per 100 000 in syphilis seropositivity and 280.5 per 100 000 in active infection, which were 3.8 times and 2.4 times higher than that for people aged <25 years, respectively. The prevalence of syphilis seropositivity (χ(2) (trend)=311.9, p (trend)<0.001) and active infection (χ(2) (trend)=72.1, p (trend)<0.001) increased significantly with age. After stratification by gender and year of donation, the increasing trend of prevalence with age remained (p (trend)<0.05), except for the prevalence of active infection in males and females in 2014. About 16.3% of donors with active infection and aged ≥45 years had a TRUST titre of ≥1∶8, lower than that of patients aged <25 years (51.3%) and 25–34 years (34.1%).

Based upon its similarity to p6 from SARS-CoV, it may play a similar role, namely as an antagonist of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion (Δ27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion (ΔFKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6. This deletion is predicted to result in a dramatic alteration in the three-dimensional structure of the resultant protein (p6Δ22-30), possibly with significant functional implications. Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. The specific function of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 N-terminus, if any, has not yet been determined. However, this deletion is predicted to cause a shift from N-endo to N-ecto in the transmembrane localization of the SARS-CoV-2 p6Δ22-30 N-terminus, possibly leading to the ablation of its native function.\\ntitle: A Rare Deletion in SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 Dramatically Alters the Predicted Three-Dimensional Structure of the Resultant Protein', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 279}), Document(page_content='abstract: Usability testing is a critical step in the process of agile iterative development. Static and lower-fidelity user-interface mock-ups can suffice during early phases of design or for user-paced environments, but higher-fidelity test beds are required to evaluate event-paced environments especially those exploring the supervisory control of automation. Increased fidelity is desirable as early as possible during the design process to explore the supervisory control design paradigm and generate more numerous and higher-quality user feedback. Complex AI-based systems are more difficult to test during early development phases. Static and low-fidelity prototypes typically cannot adequately represent the complex automation behaviors making usability more difficult to measure. A high fidelity user-interface prototyping approach was employed to simulate the capabilities of pending algorithms that are under development by multiple laboratories for a future intelligent air-defense system. The prototyping tool supported usability data collection by simulating the proposed automation and an initial supervisory control user-interface design within dynamic, group, air defense scenarios.

Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.\\ntitle: Causes and Implications of Codon Usage Bias in RNA Viruses', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 281}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused mental health problems worldwide.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study in outpatients under active cancer treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A semi-structured 24-question survey was designed to measure baseline sociodemographic, psychosocial and COVID-19 exposure characteristics. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to measure psychological symptoms. A descriptive and analytical univariate analysis of the variables studied was performed. We used the Z-score to compare different populations (experimental and historical control cohort). Results: 104 patients were included, the majority of which were women (64.4%), were above 65 years of age (57.7%), had either lung and breast cancer (56.7%), had advanced disease (64%) and were undergoing chemotherapy (63.5%). 51% of them expressed greater fear of cancer than of COVID-19 infection or both. In relation to HADS, 52.8% of emotional distress, 42.3% of anxiety and 58.6% of depression rates were detected. The main factors related with higher rates of psychological symptomatology were history of previous psychotropic drug consumption and the adoption of additional infection prevention measures because they considered themselves at risk of severe COVID-19 infection (p = 0.008; p = 0.003 for emotional distress, p = 0.026; p = 0.004 for anxiety, and p = 0.013; p = 0.008 for depression).

We feel a contrast between these measures and our freedom. This contrast, we argue, is a false perception. It only appears to us because we look at the issue through our contemporary moral philosophy of utilitarianism and an understanding of freedom as absence of constraints. Both these views can be substituted with more sophisticated alternatives, namely an ethics of virtue and a notion of freedom of the will. These offer a fuller picture of morality and enable us to cooperate with the current restrictions by consciously choosing to adhere to them instead of perceiving them as draconian and immoral. We ask whether we should collaborate with the restrictions and argue that considerations of virtue will lead to an affirmative answer. More broadly, virtue ethics permits to deal with the practical concerns about how an individual should behave during this pandemic, given the current lockdown measures or lack thereof. In section 1, we present how utilitarianism and a notion of freedom as negative liberty support the opposition to restrictive measures. In section 2, we outline an alternative based on an ethics of virtue and a more elaborated notion of free will.

Design/methodology/approach Qualitative interview study with a think aloud protocol. A total of 10 participants self-reported to have overweight, obesity or as actively trying to lose weight were recruited through social media and were asked to think aloud whilst exposed to four sets of public health and media materials describing the link between COVID-19 and obesity. Interviews were conducted over zoom, recorded and transcribed verbatim. Findings Three primary themes were identified through thematic analysis: \"flawed messaging\", \"COVID-19 as a teachable moment\" and \"barriers to change\". Transcending these themes was the notion of balance. Whilst the messaging around COVID-19 and obesity was deemed problematic;for some, it was a teachable moment to facilitate change when their future self and physical health was prioritised. Yet, when focussing on their mental health in the present participants felt more overwhelmed by the barriers and were less likely to take the opportunity to change. Practical implications Findings hold implications for public health messaging, highlighting the need for balance between being educational and informative but also supportive, so as to achieve maximum efficacy. Originality/value This study offers a novel and useful insight into how the public health and media messaging concerning COVID-19 risk and obesity is perceived by those with overweight and obesity.\\ntitle: Motivating or stigmatising?

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the 8-week lockdown on endurance capacity of elite male handball players. METHODS Ten male athletes (192±8 cm and 96±6 kg) from the first German handball league participated in the study. The effects of training on shuttle run tests between period 1 (P1: preseason to mid-season) and period 2 (P2: mid-season to time after lockdown) were compared. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was assessed using an incremental exercise test (IET) (July 2019 and May 2020). RESULTS During the COVID-19 lockdown, the athletes completed an instructed home-based strength and endurance program (52/48). The training effects were found to be reduced after the 8-weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (period 2) as compared to period 1 (mean difference 249±248 m, p=0.005). There was no significant difference in the running distance (2358±430 m vs. 2400±362 m, respectively, p=0.70) after the lockdown as compared to the pre-seasonal performance. VO2max (46.6±5.1 vs. 49.4±7.0 ml/kg/min, respectively, p=0.12) and the power output (3.13±0.36 vs. 3.13±0.43 W/kg, respectively, p=1.0) also did not differ between preseason and after COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown led to a reduction in endurance capacity of elite handball players without team training, despite a home-based strength and endurance program. Supervision of individual home-based training is highly recommended to avoid inadequate implementation of the training.\\ntitle: Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on endurance capacity of elite handball players.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 285}), Document(page_content='abstract: Obesity increases the risk for poor outcome in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). However, the role of adipose tissue for viral propagation and potential metabolic implications are not understood. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in adipose tissue of overweight but not lean male COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 replicates to high titres in cultured mature adipocytes, a process depending on lipid accumulation and mobilization. After intranasal inoculation, we observed high viral replication in fat depots of Golden Syrian hamsters, demonstrating dissemination from the respiratory tract and subsequent propagation in adipose tissue. Following induction of pro-inflammatory responses, expression of de novo lipogenesis enzymes was suppressed in adipose tissue. This specific down-regulation was reflected by lipidomic alterations in plasma of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters as well as in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Overall, our study highlights that adipose tissue is an important site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, contributing to dysregulation of systemic lipid metabolism.<br><br>Funding: This study was supported by a rapid response grant from the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG;ZMV I 1-2520COR501 to GG), by DFG grants SCHE522/4-1 (LS) and SFB1328, project- ID:335447727 (JH).

A retrospective cohort study was carried out in the Campania Region from December 2020 to April 2021. Data were retrieved from the Regional Health Information System of the Campania Region (Sinfonia). The study cohort included subjects that had all received at least one vaccine dose. Risk ratios (RRs) adjusted for age and sex (95% confidence intervals) were performed to assess differences in the prevalence between HCPs who tested positive or negative for COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between symptoms and vaccination status. Findings revealed that HCPs had a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 after receiving at least one vaccine dose, and this risk decreased with age. Furthermore, not having full vaccination coverage may predict a severe/critical evolution of the disease.

They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a sixteen-week Baduanjin intervention or an active control condition (light flexibility exercise). Frailty status (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes (physical performance, activities of daily living performance, psychological well-being, and health-related quality of life) were measured by physical performance tests and questionnaires. Qualitative interviews were conducted to explore participants' perspectives on the intervention. RESULTS Twenty-one participants (75%) completed the study, with reasons of withdrawal mainly relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Attendance at Baduanjin sessions and adherence to self-practice were satisfactory, with all retained participants attending all sessions and 81.8% practicing Baduanjin for more than 90 min per week. Qualitative findings demonstrated that participants accepted Baduanjin. The proportion of improvement in frailty status at post-intervention appeared to be higher in the intervention group (26.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1% to 54.0%) than the control group (15.4%; 95% CI, 3.7% to 46.0%); yet the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.461).

In order to address this question, this paper compares data from two studies, namely a study that explored the publishing patterns of the top 22 Greek media websites and a second study that focused on web news article consumption habits. The results indicate that there are various deviations between the compared data, and thus the study concludes that Greek media organization publishing strategy is not aligned with the audience consumption needs. The identified discrepancies have to do with the published news articles after 14:00 during weekdays as well as the news articles that are available during weekends. Additionally, it seems that media organizations publish a very limited number of articles on specific thematic categories that the audience is interested in reading. Specific actions were also proposed in order to alleviate those deviations and thus improve the readability of the media organizations.\\ntitle: Comparison of Publishing and Consumption Patterns in Greek Media Websites', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 294}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Global travel continues to increase, particularly to tropical destinations that have different health risks from those encountered closer to home.

However, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers in women, especially in developing countries. Three HPV vaccines have been licensed: bivalent (Cervarix, GSK, Rixensart, Belgium), quadrivalent (Merck, Sharp & Dome (Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA)), and nonavalent (Merck, Sharp & Dome (Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA)). The current HPV vaccine recommendations apply to 9 years old and above through the age of 26 years and adults aged 27–45 years who might be at risk of new HPV infection and benefit from vaccination. The primary target population for HPV vaccination recommended by the WHO is girls aged 9–14 years, prior to their becoming sexually active, to undergo a two-dose schedule and girls ≥ 15 years of age, to undergo a three-dose schedule. Safety data for HPV vaccines have indicated that they are safe. The most common adverse side-effect was local symptoms. HPV vaccines are highly immunogenic. The efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines has been remarkably high among young women who were HPV seronegative before vaccination. Vaccine efficacy was lower among women regardless of HPV DNA when vaccinated and among adult women. Comparisons of the efficacy of bivalent, quadrivalent, and nonavalent vaccines against HPV 16/18 showed that they are similar. However, the nonavalent vaccine can provide additional protection against HPV 31/33/45/52/58. In a real-world setting, the notable decrease of HPV 6/11/16/18 among vaccinated women compared with unvaccinated women shows the vaccine to be highly effective. Moreover, the direct effect of the nonavalent vaccine with the cross-protection of bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines results in the reduction of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58. HPV vaccination has been shown to provide herd protection as well. Two-dose HPV vaccine schedules showed no difference in seroconversion from three-dose schedules. However, the use of a single-dose HPV vaccination schedule remains controversial. For males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine possibly reduces the incidence of external genital lesions and persistent infection with HPV 6/11/16/18. Evidence regarding the efficacy and risk of HPV vaccination and HIV infection remains limited. HPV vaccination has been shown to be highly effective against oral HPV type 16/18 infection, with a significant percentage of participants developing IgG antibodies in the oral fluid post vaccination. However, the vaccines’ effectiveness in reducing the incidence of and mortality rates from HPV-related head and neck cancers should be observed in the long term. In anal infections and anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the vaccines demonstrate high efficacy.

This report highlights the role of clinical imaging during the pre-operative and post-operative phases. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Ultrasound and CT imaging was useful in determining that the tumor originated from the tail of the pancreas. The presence of a definite capsule with internal solid-cystic components helped narrowed the differential diagnosis to solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas. MR liver was useful to rule out liver metastasis in this child. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was scheduled for laparotomy and tumour excision at a regional paediatric centre. Successful excision of the tumor en-mass was performed and the child's subsequent recovery was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Clinical imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis and management of paediatric solid organ tumours.

Many vaccine trials were launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, and these vaccines were widely used around the world, offering realistic hope for ending the pandemic. Allergic reactions to vaccines were reported shortly after their approval. These reactions, in general, are rare, but, in some circumstances, they can be serious. Allergy to vaccines can occur because of either the active vaccine component or vaccine ingredients. The spectrum of the reactions may be just a local hypersensitiviy reaction or may be as severe as an anaphylaxis, which is an acute severe, life-threatening systemic hypersensitive reaction, and it requires quick intervention. If an allergy is suspected, a correct examination followed by algorithms is important for true diagnosis, treatment, and decision regarding revaccination. Patients who experience an allergic reaction with the first dose of covid 19 vaccine should be directed to the allergy-immunologist, and the evaluation of at-risk patients should be individualized. Finally, we should point out that the benefits of current COVID-19 vaccines go far beyond the side effects, and that the vaccine is the most important way to recover from the pandemic.\\ntitle: Allergic reactions against Covıd-19 vaccines', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 304}), Document(page_content='abstract: Abstract There is uncertainty if current models for the Covid-19 pandemic should already take into account seasonality. That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.\\ntitle: Pollen likely seasonal factor in inhibiting flu-like epidemics.

These challenges are especially relevant in competitive surgical specialties, where racial and gender diversity already lags behind other medical specialties. Inclusive excellence is a guiding philosophy in creating equitable resident selection processes. It focuses on the multilayered processes that form the foundation of inclusive institutional culture, while recognizing that excellence and inclusivity are mutually reinforcing and not mutually exclusive.A key tenant in inclusive excellence for resident recruiting involves applying an equity lens in all decision making. An equity lens allows programs to continuously evaluate resident selection policies and processes through an intentional equity-forward approach. In addition to using an equity lens, programs should emphasize the importance of equity-focused skill building, which ensures that all individuals engaged in the resident selection process have the tools and knowledge to recognize biases. Finally, institutions should implement specific programming for URiM applicants to provide them with information about key aspects of department culture and mechanisms of support for URiM trainees.Every residency program should adopt a sustained perspective of inclusive excellence, in this application cycle and beyond.

The Pipeline™ Embolization Device has shown high rates of complete occlusion in uncontrolled clinical series. METHODS The study is a prospective, controlled, randomized, multicenter, phase 2 open-label trial. Intention-to-treat population includes age ≥18, unruptured saccular aneurysm located in the intra-dural area, neck diameter ≥4 and ≤10 mm, sac diameter ≥7 mm and ≤20 mm, \"dome/neck\" ratio is ≥1, diameter of the parent artery ≥2 mm and ≤5 mm, and no prior treatment of the aneurysm. Site can only participate if five patients have been previously treated with the Pipeline device. The primary end point of the study is complete occlusion of the aneurysm on angiogram performed 12 months after the endovascular procedure. Complete aneurysm occlusion is defined as the absence of visible blood flow, grade 1 according to the Raymond scale for the standard procedure group and grade 4 according to the grading scale of Kamran for the flow diverter group.

Understanding MERS CoV genetic aspects and codon usage pattern is important to understand MERS CoV survival, adaptation, evolution, resistance to innate immunity, and help in finding the unique aspects of the virus for future drug discovery experiments. In this work, we provide comprehensive analysis of 238 MERS CoV full genomes comprised of human (hMERS) and camel (cMERS) isolates of the virus. MERS CoV genome shaping seems to be under compositional and mutational bias, as revealed by preference of A/T over G/C nucleotides, preferred codons, nucleotides at the third position of codons (NT3s), relative synonymous codon usage, hydropathicity (Gravy), and aromaticity (Aromo) indices. Effective number of codons (ENc) analysis reveals a general slight codon usage bias. Codon adaptation index reveals incomplete adaptation to host environment. MERS CoV showed high ability to resist the innate immune response by showing lower CpG frequencies. Neutrality evolution analysis revealed a more significant role of mutation pressure in cMERS over hMERS. Correspondence analysis revealed that MERS CoV genomes have three genetic clusters, which were distinct in their codon usage, host, and geographic distribution. Additionally, virtual screening and binding experiments were able to identify three new virus-encoded helicase binding compounds. These compounds can be used for further optimization of inhibitors.\\ntitle: Comparative Genomic Analysis MERS CoV Isolated from Humans and Camels with Special Reference to Virus Encoded Helicase.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 310}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: La progresiva incorporación de las tecnologías digitales en la educación superior ha puesto de manifiesto la necesaria competencia digital docente (CDD).

The Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix (VHM), developed by a WHO strategic advisory group of experts, can serve as an important tool to categorize vaccine hesitancy reasons reported in the JRF. We aimed to describe the reasons for vaccine hesitancy reported globally from 2014 to 2017 to ascertain trends over time and understand the comparability of using the VHM to classify hesitancy reasons from 2014 to 2016 based on previously published literature. We conducted a quantitative content analysis to code and categorize vaccine hesitancy reasons reported in the JRF from 2014 to 2017. Vaccine hesitancy trends were consistent from 2014 to 2017, where vaccine hesitancy reasons were mainly related to \"individual and group level influences\" (59%) followed by \"contextual influences\" (25%), and \"vaccine- or vaccination-specific issues\" (16%). Comparability of our approach to categorize vaccine hesitancy to the previously published JRF data showed that results were mostly but not entirely consistent. Major differences in categorizing vaccine hesitancy were noted between two specific reasons - \"experience with past vaccination\" (under \"individual and group influences\") and \"risk/benefit- scientific evidence\" (under \"vaccine and vaccination-specific issues\"); this was usually due to lack of clear definitions in some sub-categories and generic responses reported in the JRF. The JRF hesitancy module may benefit from modifications to improve the data quality.

We performed experiments using COMSOL, a finite-element multiphysics simulation software, and Python-based simulations to analyze the end-to-end communication model in terms of path loss, delay, and gain. The analytical results show the correlation between the channel characteristics and pathophysiological properties of coronavirus. For the initial 50% of the maximum production rate of virus particles, the path loss increases more than 16 times than the remaining 50%. The delayed response of the immune system and increase in the absorption of virus particles inside the respiratory tract delay the arrival of virus particles at the alveoli.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that the therapeutic effects of MSCs are not due to their direct differentiation into functional β-cells but are instead mediated by their paracrine functions. Among them, exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles, are important substances that exert paracrine functions. However, the underlying mechanisms of exosomes in ameliorating T2DM remain largely unknown. METHODS Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (bmMSC)-derived exosomes (bmMDEs) were administrated to T2DM rats and high-glucose-treated primary islets in order to detect their effects on β-cell dedifferentiation. Differential miRNAs were then screened via miRNA sequencing, and miR-146a was isolated after functional verification. TargetScan, reporter gene detection, insulin secretion assays, and qPCR validation were used to predict downstream target genes and involved signaling pathways of miR-146a. RESULTS Our results showed that bmMDEs reversed diabetic β-cell dedifferentiation and improved β-cell insulin secretion both in vitro and in vivo. Results of miRNA sequencing in bmMDEs and subsequent functional screening demonstrated that miR-146a, a highly conserved miRNA, improved β-cell function. We further found that miR-146a directly targeted Numb, a membrane-bound protein involved in cell fate determination, leading to activation of β-catenin signaling in β-cells. Exosomes derived from miR-146a-knockdown bmMSCs lost the ability to improve β-cell function. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that bmMSC-derived exosomal miR-146a protects against diabetic β-cell dysfunction by acting on the NUMB/β-catenin signaling pathway, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for T2DM.\\ntitle: Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal miR-146a reverses diabetic β-cell dedifferentiation.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 318}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had significant negative economic ramifications on dermatologic care delivery, including curtailing live on-site physician-pharmaceutical-representative interactions (PPRI). OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS: Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%&ndash;23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION: PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists&rsquo; ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

Infection with or immunization against any of these viruses induces a subset of antibodies that are broadly flavivirus cross-reactive but do not exhibit significant cross-neutralization. Nevertheless, these antibodies can efficiently bind to the major envelope protein (E), which is the main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies because of its receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. The structural basis for this phenomenon is still unclear. In our studies with TBE virus, we have provided evidence that such cross-reactive antibodies are specific for a cluster of epitopes that are partially occluded in the cage-like assembly of E proteins at the surfaces of infectious virions and involve-but are not restricted to-amino acids of the highly conserved internal fusion peptide loop. Virus disintegration leads to increased accessibility of these epitopes, allowing the cross-reactive antibodies to bind with strongly increased avidity. The cryptic properties of these sites in the context of infectious virions can thus provide an explanation for the observed lack of efficient neutralizing activity of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, despite their specificity for a functionally important structural element in the E protein.\\ntitle: Cryptic properties of a cluster of dominant flavivirus cross-reactive antigenic sites.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 321}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Background: In early March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit West Africa.

The objective of this article is to analyse the epidemiological evolution of COVID-19 in seven Francophone West African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal) as well as the public health measures decided upon during the first four months of the pandemic. Methods: : Our method is based on quantitative and qualitative data from the pooling of information from a COVID-19 data platform and collected by a network of interdisciplinary collaborators present in the seven countries. Descriptive and spatial analyses of quantitative epidemiological data and content analyses of qualitative data on public measures and management committees were performed. Results: : Attack rates for COVID-19 range from less than 10 per 100,000 inhabitants (Benin) to more than 45 per 100,000 inhabitants (Guinea). The spatio-temporal analysis shows three phases of incidence clusters. By the end of June 2020, case numbers had plateaued in some countries (Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali) while others continued to see the number of infections increasing (Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal). The countries all reacted quickly to the crisis, in some cases before the first reported infection, and implemented public measures in a relatively homogeneous manner. None of the countries implemented country-wide lockdowns, but in some cases implemented partial or local containment measures. At the end of June 2020, countries began to lift certain restrictive measures, sometimes under pressure from the general population or from certain economic sectors. All the countries have adopted response plans and organized multiple crisis management committees, although their content and functioning have not always been transparent or easy to understand.

METHODS: Mixed methods cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-three students responded to the questionnaire. Lifestyle and behaviours: 51.5% of the participants changed their diet (n=120); 45.5% (n=106) exercised less; 66.5% (n=155) experienced a change in sleep; 51.1% (n=119) reported a change in appetite. Mental health: 84.2% (n=196) reported worrying too much about different things; 61.9% (n=144) could not stop or control worrying; 71.2% experienced trouble relaxing on several days or more (n=166). At least sometimes, 72.1% (n=168) felt unable to cope with things they had to do; 8.5% (n=20) never, or almost never, felt confident about handling personal problems.

Etiology of EA COPD are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis). Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD, such as NO(2), SO(2), ozone or particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). In 30% the etiology remains unknown. Differential diagnoses of AE COPD include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. AE COPD treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. Systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic.

Subsequently, the panC group affiliation and toxin gene profile of Bacillus cereus senso lato (s.l.) isolates were determined. Our results corroborate that the overall best performing media CHROMagar™ B. cereus (93.6% inclusivity; 82.7% exclusivity) and BACARA® (98.2% inclusivity, 62.7% exclusivity) are more sensitive and specific compared to Brilliance™ B. cereus, MYP and ChromoSelect Bacillus Agar. Both media allow unequivocal detection of B. cereus with low risks of misidentification. Media containing ß-D-glucosidase for the detection of presumptive B. cereus may form atypical colony morphologies resulting in a false negative evaluation of the sample. Naturally contaminated samples presented high numbers of background flora, while numbers of presumptive B. cereus were below the detection limit (<10 CFU g-1 or mL-1). Recovery after freezing resulted in the highest detection of B. cereus s.l. on BACARA® (57.8%), CHROMagar™ B. cereus (56.3%) and MYP agar (54.7%). The panC/toxin profile combination IV/A was the most abundant (33.0%), followed by III/F (21.7%) and VI/C (10.4%). More panC and toxin combinations were present in 15.6% of samples when reanalyzed after freezing. In order to improve detection and confirmation of B. cereus s.l. in food samples, we recommend the parallel use of two complementary selective media followed by molecular characterization (e.g., panC typing combined with toxin gene profiling). When determining psychrotolerant or thermophilic members of the B. cereus group, the selective agar media should additionally be incubated at appropriate temperatures (5 °C, ≥45 °C). If high-risk toxin genes (e.g., ces or cytK-1) are detected, the strain-specific ability to produce toxin should be examined to decisively assess risk.\\ntitle: Performance Testing of Bacillus cereus Chromogenic Agar Media for Improved Detection in Milk and Other Food Samples', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 329}), Document(page_content='abstract: There is a profound need for the scientific community to be better aware of the policy context in which it operates. To address this need, Evolution has established a new Outlook feature section to include papers that explore the interface between society and evolutionary biology. This first paper in the series considers the strategic relevance of evolutionary biology. Support for scientific research in general is based on governmental or institutional expenditure that is an investment, and such investment is based on strategies designed to achieve particular outcomes, such as advance in particular areas of basic science or application. The scientific community can engage in the development of scientific strategies on a variety of levels, including workshops to explicitly develop research priorities and targeted funding initiatives to help define emerging scientific areas. Better understanding and communication of the scientific achievements of evolutionary biology, emphasizing immediate and potential societal relevance, are effective counters to challenges presented by the creationist agenda. Future papers in the Outlook feature section should assist the evolutionary biology community in achieving a better collective understanding of the societal relevance of their field.\\ntitle: Is evolutionary biology strategic science?', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 330}), Document(page_content='abstract: Recently, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have attracted attention due to their emergent use for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The success of LNPs can be attributed to ionizable lipids, which enable functional intracellular delivery. Previously, the authors established an automated high-throughput platform to screen ionizable lipids and identified that the LNPs generated using this automated technique show comparable or increased mRNA functional delivery in vitro as compared to LNPs prepared using traditional microfluidics techniques. In this study, the authors choose one benchmark lipid, DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3), and investigate whether the automated formulation technique can enhance mRNA functional delivery in vivo. Interestingly, a 4.5-fold improvement in mRNA functional delivery in vivo by automated LNPs as compared to LNPs formulated by conventional microfluidics techniques, is observed. Mechanistic studies reveal that particles with large size accommodate more mRNA per LNP, possess more hydrophobic surface, are more hemolytic, bind a larger protein corona, and tend to accumulate more in macropinocytosomes, which may quantitatively benefit mRNA cytosolic delivery. These data suggest that mRNA loading per particle is a critical factor that accounts for the enhanced mRNA functional delivery of automated LNPs. These mechanistic findings provide valuable insight underlying the enhanced mRNA functional delivery to accelerate future mRNA LNP product development.\\ntitle: Mechanistic Studies of an Automated Lipid Nanoparticle Reveal Critical Pharmaceutical Properties Associated with Enhanced mRNA Functional Delivery In Vitro and In Vivo', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 331}), Document(page_content='abstract: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite infecting up to one third of the human population. The central event in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis is the conversion of tachyzoites into encysted bradyzoites. A novel approach to analyze the structure of in vivo-derived tissue cysts may be the increasingly used computational image analysis. The objective of this study was to quantify the geometrical complexity of T. gondii cysts by morphological, particle, and fractal analysis, as well as to determine if it is impacted by parasite strain, cyst age, and host type. A total of 31 images of T. gondii brain cysts of four type-2 strains (Me49, and local isolates BGD1, BGD14, and BGD26) was analyzed using ImageJ software. The parameters of interest included diameter, circularity, packing density (PD), fractal dimension (FD), and lacunarity. Although cyst diameter varied widely, its negative correlation with PD was observed. Circularity was remarkably close to 1, indicating a perfectly round shape of the cysts. PD and FD did not vary among cysts of different strains, age, and derived from mice of different genetic background. Conversely, lacunarity, which is a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly lower for BGD1 strain vs. all other strains, and higher for Me49 vs. BGD14 and BGD26, but did not differ among Me49 cysts of different age, or those derived from genetically different mice. The results indicate a highly uniform structure and occupancy of the different T. gondii tissue cysts. This study furthers the use of image analysis in describing the structural complexity of T. gondii cyst morphology, and presents the first application of fractal analysis for this purpose. The presented results show that use of a freely available software is a cost-effective approach to advance automated image scoring for T. gondii cysts.\\ntitle: Computational image analysis reveals the structural complexity of Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 332}), Document(page_content='abstract: China is evolving—it is becoming modern and international—but its trajectory will never intersect with the West’s.

METHODS: We identified 18,583 patients diagnosed with primary malignant bone tumors between 1973 and 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on the mortality data of the general population gathered by the National Center for Health Statistics, which provided the risk of death from pneumonia among cancer patients relative to that of the general population. Given that other causes of death were considered as competing events, we also designed the Fine-Gray model to identify demographic and tumor-related characteristics associated with a higher risk of dying from pneumonia among these patients. RESULTS: Patients with primary malignant bone tumors had a higher risk of dying from pneumonia than the general population after adjusting the distribution difference of age, sex, and race among them (SMR =2.79; 95% CI: 2.17–3.59). The older age, Black and earlier period of diagnosis were found to be the independent prognostic factor for a higher risk of death from pneumonia for these patients. Additionally, amputation due to malignant bone tumors significantly increased the risk of death from pneumonia compared with non-surgery. The highest mortality rate of pneumonia was observed among patients with chordoma. Interaction tests demonstrated that amputation only increased the relative risk of fatal pneumonia among patients with osteosarcoma. Throughout the follow-up period, the mortality rate of fatal pneumonia was the highest within the first year after diagnosis, and the highest relative suicide risks persisted over time in patients with osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: To mitigate the risk of fatal pneumonia among patients with bone tumors, we call for long-term clinical monitoring of the lung condition among these patients, especially for those after amputation for bone tumors.\\ntitle: Characteristics, incidence, and risk factors for death from fatal pneumonia among patients with primary malignant bone tumors: a SEER-based observational study', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 335}), Document(page_content='abstract: Immunosuppression and immunomodulation are valuable therapeutic approaches for managing neuroimmunological diseases.

We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S.\\ntitle: A Health Economic Analysis for Oral Poliovirus Vaccine to Prevent COVID-19 in the United States', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 342}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: For example, collective or community hope is more than the sense of individual hope of the members of a particular community.

The recent wave of NPF spread in the USA has been fueled by an increased presence of counterfeit pills that contain NPF. This qualitative study aims to characterize the motivation and practices of counterfeit NPF pill initiation and use among individuals using illicit opioids in Arizona. METHODS: Between October 2020 and May 2021, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 individuals meeting the following eligibility criteria: (1) 18 years or older; (2) residence in Arizona; and (3) use of illicit opioids in the past 30 days and/or opioid use disorder treatment in the past 12 months. Participants were recruited through referrals by a harm reduction organization, craigslist ads, and referrals by other participants. Interviews were conducted virtually via Zoom. Qualitative interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically using NVivo. RESULTS: Out of 22 participants, 64% were male, and 45% were ethnic minorities. Age ranged between 25 and 51 years old. Participants noted significant recent increases in the availability of counterfeit NPF pills (“blues,” “dirty oxys”) that were most commonly used by smoking. The majority indicated first trying NPF pills in the past year, and the first use often occurred in situations of reduced access to heroin or pharmaceutical opioids. Participant decisions to switch over to more frequent NPF pill use or to maintain some levels of heroin use were shaped by local drug availability trends and personal experiences with NPF effects. They were also influenced by conflicting views of social acceptability of pharmaceutical-like drugs, perceived harms of NPF in terms of overdose risks and increased difficulty of quitting, and perceived benefits of switching to the non-injection route of opioid administration (e.g., from injecting heroin to smoking NPF pills). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need for the implementation of novel policy, treatment, and harm reduction approaches to address the growing unpredictability of drug supply and NPF pill-specific risks, attitudes, and behaviors.\\ntitle: “They say it’s fentanyl, but they honestly look like Perc 30s”: Initiation and use of counterfeit fentanyl pills', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 344}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: With visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence at its lowest level since the 1960s, increasing attention has turned to early detection and investigation of outbreaks. METHODS: Outbreak investigations were triggered by recognition of case clusters in the VL surveillance system established for the elimination program. Investigations included ascertainment of all VL cases by date of fever onset, household mapping and structured collection of risk factor data. RESULTS: VL outbreaks were investigated in 13 villages in 10 blocks of 7 districts. Data were collected for 20,670 individuals, of whom 272 were diagnosed with VL between 2012 and 2019. Risk was significantly higher among 10–19 year-olds and adults 35 or older compared to children younger than 10 years. Outbreak confirmation triggered vector control activities and heightened surveillance. VL cases strongly clustered in tolas (hamlets within villages) in which > 66% of residents self-identified as scheduled caste or scheduled tribe (SC/ST); 79.8% of VL cases occurred in SC/ST tolas whereas only 24.2% of the population resided in them. Other significant risk factors included being an unskilled non-agricultural laborer, migration for work in a brick kiln, living in a kuccha (mud brick) house, household crowding, habitually sleeping outside or on the ground, and open defecation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the importance of sensitive surveillance with triggers for case cluster detection and rapid, careful outbreak investigations to better respond to ongoing and new transmission. The strong association with SC/ST tolas suggests that efforts should focus on enhanced surveillance in these disadvantaged communities.

In addition, we argue for high awareness of a major secondary, nonbiological crisis arising from the side effects of societal and economic pandemic reactions to actual or imagined health risks.

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. Methods: We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). Findings: Under scenario A, we estimated 5,196,000 (UI 1,753,000 - 10,220,000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966,000 (UI 467,800 - 1,702,000) hospitalizations and 111,000 (UI 53,400 - 200,000) deaths.

AIM First, focus on the most commonly used vitamin supplements and comprehensively review the evidence for and against recommending them to patients to improve and/or maintain cardiovascular health. Second, illustrate how the interest in studies shifted over time from Vitamin A, E, C, and B to Vitamin D and observational studies led to randomized controlled trials. METHODS A thorough PubMed search with the phrase: \"Vitamin supplements and cardiovascular health\" was performed. In the present review, focus was maintained on the evidence for the use of vitamin supplements in the prevention of major cardiovascular events and/or the maintenance of cardiovascular health by comprehensively reviewing all previous studies indexed in PubMed. Studies with clinical \\'hard\\' end-points were included only. RESULTS A total of 87 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in the present article. High-quality evidence suggesting benefits for the use of vitamin supplements to maintain or improve cardiovascular health in people is minimal to non-existent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic Radiology (DR) studies and Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures at a single tertiary-care teaching institution between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed. DR was divided by section: body, cardiothoracic, musculoskeletal (MSK), neuroradiology, nuclear medicine, pediatrics, and women's imaging. IR was divided by procedural types: arterial, venous, lymphatic, core, neuro, pediatrics, dialysis, cancer embolization or ablation, noncancer embolization, portal hypertension, and miscellaneous. Impact on didactic education was also assessed. ANOVA, t test, and multiple comparison correction were used for analysis. RESULTS: DR and IR caseloads decreased significantly in April 2020 compared to April of the prior 5 years (both p < 0.0001). Case volumes were reduced in body (49.2%, p < 0.01), MSK (54.2%, p < 0.05), neuro (39.3%, p < 0.05), and women's imaging (75.5%, p < 0.05) in DR, and in arterial (62.6%, p < 0.01), neuro IR (57.6%, p < 0.01) and core IR (42.6%, p < 0.05) in IR. IR trainee average caseload in April 2020 decreased 51.9% compared to April of the prior 5 years (p < 0.01). Utilization of online learning increased in April. Trainees saw significant increases in overall DR didactics (31.3%, p = 0.02) and no reduction in IR didactics, all online. Twelve major national and international DR and IR meetings were canceled or postponed between March and July. CONCLUSION: Decreases in caseload and widespread cancellation of conferences have had significant impact on DR/IR training during COVID-19 restrictions. Remote learning technologies with annotated case recording, boards-style case reviews, procedural simulation and narrated live cases as well as online lectures and virtual journal clubs increased during this time. Whether remote learning can mitigate lost opportunities from in-person interactions remains uncertain. Optimizing these strategies will be important for potential future restricted learning paradigms and can also be extrapolated to augment trainee education during unrestricted times.\\ntitle: Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Case Volume and Education in the Age of Pandemics: Impact Analysis and Potential Future Directions\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 357}), Document(page_content='abstract: Since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11, there has been increasing worldwide interest in it Since then, cases of maternal infection have been reported in China, and recent cases of maternal infection and delivery have also occurred in Korea No cure or vaccine for COVID-19 has been found, and there is no unified domestic guideline for the treatment of relatively high-risk mothers against disease Several recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists were suggested So far, data on COVID-19 is scarce, but it is expected to be similar to the same coronavirus infections as a middle east respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome and can be prepared accordingly For COVID-19, there was no evidence of vertical transmission at delivery, and the virus was not detected in breast milk The delivery method should be considered depending on the situation, but vaginal delivery is also possible and should be performed with complete personal protective equipment in a negative-pressure isolation room After birth, the newborn should be separated from the mother, and the newborn should be isolated as a suspected COVID-19 infection and followed up In the future, further research should develop clinical guidelines for maternal care for COVID-19\\ntitle: Recent Trend about Pregnant Women with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 358}), Document(page_content='abstract: The deadly second wave of COVID-19 has seen an unprecedented surge in mucormycosis associated mortality in India, overwhelming the heath authorities with challenges beyond measure. Also known as black fungus, this life-threatening fungal infection usually manifests in the nose, spreads to the eyes, and in some cases also to the brain. Immune suppression, pre-existing conditions, prolonged and indiscriminate use of steroids, and unhygienic environments are some of the widely recognized risk factors for contracting black fungus in individuals recovered from COVID-19. However, diagnosis of the infection remains insufficient due to the lack a holistic understanding of the possible risks, symptoms, and exposure pathways and therefore no definite protocol exists for managing this fatal infection. Here, we synthesize the current state of knowledge on black fungus outbreak in India and identify key gaps in its understanding with respect to potential risk factors leading to the widespread infection. We looked at 3354 black fungus cases in India, enlisting ailment history (particularly diabetes) and steroid usage in COVID-19 patients as the key factors responsible for exacerbating risks associated with the disease. However, we also press on the possibilities that other less studied non-traditional risk factors may also have a role in causing the infection. Black fungus is therefore a reality of COVID-19, with or without diabetes or steroid use needs to be investigated.

In particular, a specific Skyrme submodel, the so-called Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model, allows both for an exact field-theoretic and a mean-field treatment of neutron stars, as a consequence of its perfect fluid property. A pure BPS Skyrme model description of neutron stars, however, only describes the neutron star core, by construction. Here we consider different possibilities to extrapolate a BPS Skyrme neutron star at high baryon density to a description valid at lower densities. In the exact field-theoretic case, a simple effective description of the neutron star crust can be used, because the exact BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions formally extend to sufficiently low densities. In the mean-field case, on the other hand, the BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions always remain above the nuclear saturation density and, therefore, must be joined to a different nuclear physics equation of state already for the outer core. We study the resulting neutron stars in both cases, facilitating an even more complete comparison between Skyrmionic neutron stars and neutron stars obtained from other approaches, as well as with observations.\\ntitle: Adding crust to BPS Skyrme neutron stars\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 360}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) in the general population of Kazakhstan has never been characterized.

In the literature, most cases demonstrate PTA following acute tonsillitis; however, less documented are cases arising in post-tonsillectomy patients. Here, we report a 45-year-old woman with a history of tonsillectomy 16 years prior, who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with PTA, including sore throat and the presence of a right-sided abscess in the posterolateral oropharynx with apparent pus. The patient reported three previous episodes of right-sided PTA, all of which were addressed via drainage and antibiotic treatment. This episode was treated similarly; cultures from the abscess revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on a short course of clindamycin and discharged to follow-up with her primary care physician. Several theories for the etiology of PTA development in post-tonsillectomy patients exist. One theory suggests that PTA may develop in this group of patients due to imperfect margins during the initial surgery, with residual tonsil tissue serving as a nidus for abscess development. Other theories suggest that a congenital fistula may exist in these patients, which, when occluded by scar tissue following a tonsillectomy, may lead to PTA development. Similarly, occlusion of minor salivary ducts has also been suggested to play a role in this unique pathophysiology. Overall, documenting rare cases of PTA development in post-tonsillectomy patients serves as a means of better understanding the complicated etiology behind PTA development and may be able to guide treatment in the future.\\ntitle: Recurrent Peritonsillar Abscess in Post-tonsillectomy Patient', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 363}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: The COVID-19, illness caused by a novel coronavirus, is the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province China beginning in 31 December 2019. The direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic and the public health measures taken to prevent the distribution of the pandemic on mortality and morbidity, and social and economic status of the community are enormous. The public health measures against the pandemic such as school closure, unemployment and business shutdown incur cost on the society;reduce the provision and quality of health services due to the diversion of resource allocation to COVID-19 response (prevention and control) activities;result in negative influence on the healthcare seeking behavior of the society;and increase cost of seeking healthcare due to reduced global pharmaceutical supply chain. Evidence-based decision is crucial to prevent and manage the catastrophic impact of a pandemic and its public health measures. The aim of this review is to systematically review economic evaluation of interventions to respond to coronavirus pandemics in the global perspective. We included researches on influenza pandemic and COVID-19 as there are only few studies conducted in COVID-19. Method: A full and partial economic analysis conducted on influenza and COVID-19 pandemic published in English language between 2012 and 2020 will be eligible. Studies with and without comparators will be included. We will build an exhaustive database search strategy in the global health cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) registry, PubMed, African Journals online and Elsevier for relevant studies. We will do a hand-searching of cited research and bibliographies of all identified relevant studies. Two authors will independently select potentially eligible titles and abstracts, extract data from selected studies using structured collection form after a pre-test and do a risk of bias assessment. Third author will be involved if there is disagreement between the two. If variation of extracted data between the reviewers is observed, the phase will be repeated, and if discrepancies between data extractors continued, third reviewer will be involved. We will use a narrative summary and tables to summarize the result and characteristics of eligible studies. In addition, attempts will be made to change reports in case and death averted to disability life year averted (DALY) averted. Discussion: Unless a careful decision is made to control a pandemic;the health, economy, social, and political aspect of countries will be in impacted. Public health measures that are implemented to respond to a pandemic should be cost-effective.

Based on the Health Action Process Approach this study tested whether changes in social-cognitive variables are associated with transitions between stages regarding physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable intake (FVI). METHODS N = 132 participants (M = 50.86 years, SD = 13.17, 61.4% women) were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks later. Data were analysed using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and post-hoc comparisons. RESULTS Changes in motivational self-efficacy (η2 = 0.081), maintenance self-efficacy (η2 = 0.119), and recovery self-efficacy (η2 = 0.049) as well as positive outcome expectancies (η2 = 0.070), negative outcome expectancies (η2 = 0.055), and coping planning (η2 = 0.065) were associated with FVI stage progression. For PA, changes were not associated with stage progression. CONCLUSION To facilitate behavior change effectively, at least for FVI, it is essential to consider underlying mechanisms such as several aspects of self-efficacy in performing the desired health behaviors, outcome expectations, and planning how to overcome barriers.

This scoring system has been translated into other languages. Given the lack of an Italian version of the OES, the present study was designed to establish, culturally adapt, and validate the Italian version. METHODS: The OES questionnaire was culturally adapted to Italian patients in accordance with the literature guidelines with a pilot phase including seven patients with elbow problems and seven healthy subjects. The study includes 110 participants from three hospitals, who underwent elbow surgery for acute (70%) or chronic diseases. At least one month after elbow surgery, at the “index visit”, the physician completed the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and patients completed the following questionnaires: the Italian OES, the shortened version of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH) and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Reproducibility was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient in ten patients who completed the OES again two-three days after the index visit. Construct validity was assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. Responsiveness was evaluated in 68 patients who answered the questionnaires four months after the index visit, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the effect size and the standardized response mean calculation. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha was excellent: 0.86 (0.82-0.90) for OES pain, 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for OES function, and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for OES social/psychological. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (0.78-0.98) for OES pain, 0.91 (0.71-0.97) for OES function, 0.95 (0.83-0.98) for OES social-psychological and 0.93 (0.76-0.98) for OES total. The Spearman ρ was >0.7 for OES pain and QuickDASH, for OES function and both QuickDASH and Mayo Elbow Performance Index, and for OES social-psychological and QuickDASH. Regarding responsiveness, the mean of the changes between the two visits ranged from 33.9 for OES pain, to 44 points for OES function and OES social/psychological. The effect size and the standardized response mean were >0.8 for all OES domains.

We aimed to evaluate QoL scores before and after POEM at medium and long term, to evaluate differences between achalasia subtypes and find which factors related to low QoL scores. Patients and methods Achalasia-confirmed patients undergoing POEM between February 2012 and November 2016. and completing at least 1 year of follow-up, were included. Assessment before and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after POEM employed manometry, barium series, Eckardt score, and the AE-18 health-related QoL scale. Demographic, clinical, and procedure characteristics were documented, with comparisons between subgroups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done. Results 65 of 88 patients were included (38 women, 27 men; median age 47 years, interquartile range [IQR] 20 - 81), and 50 (76.9 %) completed 4 years of follow-up. Eckardt score improved (median, preprocedure 10 vs. post-procedure 2; P = 0.002) and this persisted. There was initial improvement in median integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) (29.4 mmHg [16 - 55] vs. 10.3 mmHg [3 - 18]; P = 0.000) and median QoL scores (40 vs. 68 at 1 month; P = 0.002); however IRP increased and QoL scores decreased. Men with confirmed type III achalasia had low QoL scores. Conclusions All patients had significant clinical improvement after POEM, with medium- to long-term persistence. Though quality of life and IRP initially improved, they deteriorated in the long term. Male sex and type III achalasia seem to be associated with low QoL scores.\\ntitle: Long-term quality of life after peroral endoscopic myotomy remains compromised in patients with achalasia type III.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 368}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND The utility of using the VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet inhibition assay in patients undergoing Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms remains controversial. As we have routinely employed the assay for patients undergoing flow diversion, we elected to explore the relationship between P2Y12 hyporesponse as indicated by a P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) value >200 and treatment outcomes, including intraprocedural platelet aggregation and ischemic complications. METHODS All successful intracranial aneurysm Pipeline treatments performed at our institution from November 2011 to May 2019 were included. The rate of P2Y12 hyporesponse and treatment outcomes were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to determine independent predictors of treatment outcomes. RESULTS 333 qualifying treatments were performed in 297 patients. Clopidogrel hyporesponse was initially noted in 24%, falling to 17% by day-of-procedure by dose titration. A glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor was administered prophylactically in 3% of cases for persistent, profound hyporesponse. 27 (8.1%) patients developed acute platelet aggregation; only 6 demonstrated day-of-procedure P2Y12 hyporesponse. Day-of-procedure hyporesponse was not associated with intraprocedural platelet aggregation or ischemic complications. Greater Pipeline embolization device (PED) diameter was associated with a reduced odds of platelet aggregation (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; p=0.019). Antiplatelet non-compliance (OR 25.20, 95% CI 3.86 to 164.61; p=0.001) and treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms (OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.22 to 22.33; p=0.026) were the only independent predictors of ischemic complications. CONCLUSIONS P2Y12 hyporesponse was not associated with acute platelet aggregation or ischemic complications in our patients undergoing Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms, possibly due to aggressive management of the hyporesponse using clopidogrel dose titration and/or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration.\\ntitle: The utility of platelet inhibition testing in patients undergoing Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 369}), Document(page_content='abstract: Much has happened here since the local news media trumpeted the first Australian COVID-19 fatality, and stirred up a medieval fear of contagion.

We examined the impact of demography, subspecialty characteristics, and broadband availability on the utilization of telehealth in pediatric populations before and after the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Outpatients scheduled for subspecialty visits at sites affiliated with a single quaternary academic medical center between March – June 2019 and March – June 2020 were included. The contribution of demographic, socioeconomic, and broadband availability to visit completion and telehealth utilization were examined in multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Among visits scheduled in 2020 compared to 2019, in-person visits fell from 23,318 to 11,209, while telehealth visits increased from 150 to 7,675. Visits among established patients fell by 15% and new patients by 36% (p<.0001). Multivariable analysis revealed that completed visits were reduced for Hispanic patients and those with reduced broadband; high income, private non-HMO insurance, and those requesting an interpreter were more likely to complete visits. Of those with visits scheduled in 2020, established patients, those with reduced broadband, and patients older than 1 year were more likely to complete TH appointments. Cardiology, oncology, and pulmonology patients were less likely to complete scheduled TH appointments. CONCLUSIONS: Following COVID-19 onset, outpatient pediatric subspecialty visits shifted rapidly to telehealth. However, the impact of this shift on social disparities in outpatient utilization was mixed with variation among subspecialties. A growing reliance on telehealth will necessitate insights from other healthcare settings serving populations of diverse social and technological character.\\ntitle: The Impact of Telehealth Adoption During COVID-19 Pandemic on Patterns of Pediatric Subspecialty Care Utilization', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 374}), Document(page_content='abstract: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to unfold there is an untold number of trade-offs being made in every country around the globe.

This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the comparative efficacy, safety, and acceptability of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) commonly used off label to treat DRP. METHODS: We included 22 eligible studies from a systematic literature review of AAPs (quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazole) used off label to treat DRP. Study outcomes were: (1) efficacy-neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home (NPI-NH psychosis subscale), (2) safety-mortality, cerebrovascular events (CVAEs), and others (somnolence, falls, fractures, injuries, etc.), and (3) acceptability-discontinuations due to all causes, lack of efficacy, and adverse events (AEs). We used random-effects modeling to estimate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) for NPI-NH psychosis subscale scores and odds ratios (OR) for other dichotomous outcomes, with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Compared with placebo, aripiprazole (SMD - 0.12; 95% CI - 0.31, 0.06), and olanzapine (SMD - 0.17; 95% CI - 0.04; 0.02) demonstrated small, non-significant numerical improvements in NPI-NH psychosis scores (5 studies; n = 1891), while quetiapine (SMD 0.04; 95% CI - 0.23, 0.32) did not improve symptoms. The odds of mortality (15 studies, n = 4989) were higher for aripiprazole (OR 1.58; 95% CI 0.62, 4.04), brexpiprazole (OR 2.22; 95% CI 0.30, 16.56), olanzapine (OR 2.21; 95% CI 0.84, 5.85), quetiapine (OR 1.68; 95% CI 0.70, 4.03), and risperidone (OR 1.63; 95% CI 0.93, 2.85) than for placebo. Risperidone (OR 3.68; 95% CI 1.68, 8.95) and olanzapine (OR 4.47; 95% CI 1.36, 14.69) demonstrated significantly greater odds of CVAEs compared to placebo. Compared with placebo, odds of all-cause discontinuation were significantly lower for aripiprazole (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51, 0.98; 20 studies; 5744 patients) and higher for other AAPs. Aripiprazole (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.31, 0.82) and olanzapine (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.31, 0.74) had significantly lower odds of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (OR 12 studies; n = 4382) compared to placebo, while results for quetiapine and risperidone were not significant. Compared with placebo, the odds of discontinuation due to AEs (19 studies, n = 5445) were higher for olanzapine (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.75, 3.92), brexpiprazole (OR 1.80; 95% CI 0.80, 4.07), quetiapine (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.82, 1.91), aripiprazole (OR 1.38; 95% CI 0.90, 2.13), and risperidone (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.02, 1.94). CONCLUSIONS: Overall results demonstrate that, compared with placebo, quetiapine is not associated with improvement in psychosis in patients with dementia, while olanzapine and aripiprazole have non-significant small numerical improvements. These off-label AAPs (quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazole) are associated with greater odds of mortality, CVAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs than placebo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients in the International Retrospective Study of Pipeline Embolization Device registry with an unruptured aneurysm were categorized as those who underwent platelet testing before Pipeline embolization device treatment or those who did not. Complication rates were compared by using the Fisher exact or Pearson χ(2) test. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if platelet function testing was independently associated with poor outcomes after adjusting for age, number of devices and aneurysms, aneurysm location and size, and practitioner and center volume. RESULTS Compared with the patients who received a Pipeline embolization device without platelet testing, those who underwent platelet testing and Pipeline embolization device placement experienced higher rates of intracranial hemorrhage (0 of 187 [0.0%] vs 12 of 511 [2.3%], respectively; P = .04), neurologic morbidity (4 of 187 [2.1%] vs 42 of 511 [8.2%], respectively; P < .01), and combined neurologic morbidity and mortality (6 of 187 [3.2%] vs 45 of 511 [8.8%], respectively; P = .01).

With elevated procalcitonin, multiple members of the short and medium chain acylcarnitine, dicarboxylate fatty acid, branched-chain amino acid, and pentose phosphate pathway metabolite classes had significantly positive false discovery rate corrected associations. Further, multiple long chain acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines had significantly negative false discovery rate corrected associations with elevated procalcitonin.

As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously.

However, it is unclear how c-Fos regulates orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in vivo. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse OTM in transgenic mice with overexpression of c-Fos. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed c-Fos transgenic mice (c-Fos tg) and wild-type littermates (WT) in a model of OTM induced by Nitinol tension springs that were bonded between the left first maxillary molars and the upper incisors. The unstimulated contralateral side served as an internal control. Mice were analysed by contact radiography, micro-computed tomography, decalcified histology and histochemistry. RESULTS: Our analysis of the unstimulated side revealed that alveolar bone and root morphology were similar between c-Fos tg and control mice. However, we observed more osteoclasts in the alveolar bone of c-Fos tg mice as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells were increased by 40%. After 12 days of OTM, c-Fos tg mice exhibited 62% increased tooth movement as compared with WT mice. Despite the faster tooth movement, c-Fos tg and WT mice displayed the same amount of root resorption. Importantly, we did not observe orthodontically induced tissue necrosis (i.e. hyalinization) in c-Fos tg mice, while this was a common finding in WT mice. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of c-Fos accelerates tooth movement without causing more root resorption.

RESULTS 64 male and 93 female patients were included in this study. The most common findings included lymphopenia in 153 (98%) of the 157 patients, neutrophilia in 129 (82%), thrombocytopenia in 87 patients (55%), followed by thrombocytosis in 77 (49%), and isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in 96 patients (63%). The haemoglobin count dropped by more than 20 g/l from baseline in 95 (61%) patients. Four patients (2.5%) developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Lymphopenia was shown in haemato-lymphoid organs at postmortem examination. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age and a high concentration of lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent predictors of an adverse outcome.

GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fusion inhibition by GA of all three classes of fusion proteins including HIV, Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A virus (IAV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). In addition, we show inhibition of a non-enveloped adenovirus. Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event. Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).\\ntitle: Ginkgolic acid inhibits fusion of enveloped viruses', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 388}), Document(page_content='abstract: Bovine coronavirus (BCV) causes neonatal calf diarrhea (CD) and is associated with winter dysentery (WD) in adult dairy cattle.

These links have not yet been investigated in the domain of sports and exercise. However, poor decisions or excessive risk behavior would be highly detrimental to sporting performance and, in some cases, even cause physical harm. Here, we address this gap by assessing if boredom proneness is linked to general risk taking, sport-specific risk taking, and to regrets about sports-specific decision errors with respect to acting too risky or too passively. Methods: N = 936 athletes (27.6 ± 9.0 years, 89.6% men): n = 330 Climbers (31.8 ± 10.7 years, 82.4% men), n = 83 Snowboarders (29.9 ± 8.3 years, 79.5% men), and n = 523 Esports athletes (24.6 ± 6.3 years, 95.8% men) completed the Short Boredom Proneness Scale (SBPS), along with measures for objective risk taking (Balloon Analogue Risk Task; BART), subjective risk taking (general willingness to take risks), as well as assessments for sport-specific risk taking and regrets for sports-specific decision errors (taking too many risks, failing to act at all). In the two extreme sports samples (i.e., climbers and snowboarders), we additionally assessed self-selected outcome certainty in a hypothetical sports-specific scenario where an error would result in physical harm. Results: A series of multiple regression analyses revealed that boredom proneness was unrelated to objective and subjective general risk taking, but a significant predictor of sport-specific risk taking and higher risk taking in the sports scenario (climbers and snowboarders only). Most importantly, boredom proneness predicted regrets for taking too many risks and being too passive. Exploratory post-hoc analyses further indicated that boredom proneness in extreme sports athletes was lower than in esports athletes. Higher boredom proneness was significantly related to lower skill levels across all kinds of sport. Discussion: Across three athlete samples, boredom proneness was unrelated to general risk taking but significantly related to poorer decision making, as indicated by regrets about acting too risky and too passively, as well as demanding a significantly lower safety threshold to make a risky sports-specific choice. While at odds with the often-reported link between boredom proneness and risk taking, these results are consistent with the conceptualization of boredom proneness as a maladaptive self-regulatory disposition that leads to noisy decision making in sports. In addition, we provide preliminary evidence that boredom proneness covaries with self-selection into specific types of sports and might also stand in the way of skill acquisition in sports.\\ntitle: Boredom Proneness Predicts Self-Assessed Decision Errors in Sports but Is Unrelated to Risk Taking in General', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 391}), Document(page_content='abstract: To date, the microbiome, as well as the virome of the Croatian populations of bats, was unknown.

Standard precautions are embedded in modern healthcare policies, but not uniformly observed by all clinicians. Well-documented differences in attitudes to IPC, between doctors and nurses, contribute to suboptimal IPC practices and persistence of preventable healthcare-associated infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected healthcare professionals’ work-practices, lives and health and increased awareness and observance of IPC. Successful transition of health services to a ‘post-COVID-19’ future, will depend on sustainable integration of lessons learnt into routine practice. Methods: The aim of this pre-COVID-19 qualitative study was to investigate factors influencing doctors’ IPC attitudes and practices, whether they differ from those of nurses and, if so, how this affects interprofessional relationships. We hypothesised that better understanding would guide new strategies to achieve more effective IPC. We interviewed 26 senior clinicians (16 doctors and 10 nurses) from a range of specialties, at a large Australian tertiary hospital. Interview transcripts were reviewed iteratively, and themes identified inductively, using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Participants from both professions painted clichéd portraits of ‘typical’ doctors and nurses and recounted unflattering anecdotes of their IPC behaviours. Doctors were described as self-directed and often unaware or disdainful of IPC rules;while nurses were portrayed as slavishly following rules, ostensibly to protect patients, irrespective of risk or evidence. Many participants believed that doctors object to being reminded of IPC requirements by nurses, despite many senior doctors having limited knowledge of correct IPC practice. Overall, participants’ comments suggested that the ‘doctor-nurse game’ - described in the 1960s, to exemplify the complex power disparity between professions - is still in play, despite changes in both professions, in the interim. Conclusions: The results suggest that interprofessional differences and inconsistencies constrain IPC practice improvement. IPC inconsistencies and failures can be catastrophic, but the common threat of COVID-19 has promoted focus and unity. Appropriate implementation of IPC policies should be context-specific and respect the needs and expertise of all stakeholders. We propose an ethical framework to guide interprofessional collaboration in establishing a path towards sustained improvements in IPC and bio-preparedness.\\ntitle: What is Needed to Sustain Improvements in Hospital Practices Post-COVID-19?

However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress.

This study investigated whether there is an association between their prescription and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study comparing the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) to those treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 in each drug exposure group. We used Cox proportional hazards models to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19. We assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The incidence rate of COVID-19 among users of ACE inhibitors and CCBs was 9.3 per 1000 person-years (83 of 18,895 users [0.44%]) and 9.5 per 1000 person-years (85 of 18,895 [0.45%]), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). The incidence rate among users of ARBs was 15.8 per 1000 person-years (79 out of 10,623 users [0.74%]). The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of RAS inhibitors and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant increase compared to the use of CCBs.

Rapid access to bundles (clusters) of related elements of knowledge gathered from diverse sources on the Internet and from growing knowledge repositories seem particularly helpful when exploring less obvious therapeutic targets in viruses (for which knowledge new to the researcher is important), and when using the following concept. Subsequences of amino acid residue sequences of proteins that are conserved across strains and species are (a) more likely to be important targets and (b) less likely to exhibit escape mutations that would make them resistant to vaccines and therapeutic agents. However, the terms “conserved” and even “highly conserved” used by authors are matters of degree, depending on how distant from SARS-CoV-2 they wished to go in comparing other sequences. The binding site to the human ACE2 protein as virus receptor and human antibody CR3022 binding site on the spike glycoprotein are rather variable by the criteria used in the present and preceding studies. To look for more strongly conserved targets, open reading Frames of SARS-CoV-2 were examined for extremely highly conserved regions, meaning recognizable across many viruses and organisms. Most prominent is a motif found in SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3).

METHODS Consecutive patients in the adult medical intensive care unit of one large tertiary care hospital who received physical therapy sessions while on CRRT were prospectively evaluated over 13 months. Physical therapy sessions were individualized on the basis of patients' physical impairments and activity tolerance, with patients' highest level of mobility recorded. Data on 15 different physiological abnormalities and potential safety events, including bleeding, dislodgement, or dysfunction of the CRRT catheter or circuit, were prospectively collected. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Eleven physical therapists delivered 268 rehabilitation sessions to 57 patients while they were receiving CRRT, with the following highest levels of mobility achieved during individual sessions: 78 (29%) bed exercises, 72 (27%) supine cycle ergometry, 80 (30%) sitting at edge of bed, 13 (5%) transfer to chair, and 25 (9%) standing or marching in place. No CRRT-specific safety events occurred (0%; 95% upper confidence interval, 6.3%).

METHODS: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. RESULTS: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Less than two-third of nurses intended to take COVID-19 vaccine when available.

The decision made by the model can advise a patient on whether it is critical to visit a doctor or not. In this paper, a CNN based transfer learning model was used to provide a superior precision in image classification. The neural network model was trained and tested using 1,183 radiography images to report the precision that can be attained in authentic conditions using three different CNNs. The accuracy of the model in classifying radiography images is 97.46% for ternary classification and 99.36% accuracy for binary classification using VGG-16 CNN architecture.

The Indonesian government implemented “large-scale social restrictions,” which have impacted farming and farmers' food security. Farmers are both producers and consumers of food and, therefore, have been facing new challenges due to transport restrictions, price spikes for inputs, price drops for their produce, or conditions which aggravated cooperation, such as social distancing. This study aims at analysing the challenges of the containments from a smallholder farmer perspective and examining farmers' coping potential. A digital survey with 323 farmers has been designed as comparative observational research in Toraja, South Sulawesi, and selected regions of Java. The Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test was used to test for significance regarding socioeconomic factors and space. A logistic regression model extracted determinants for crisis coping. Results reveal, that female farmers worry more about COVID-19 outbreak compared to men at a significant level. In contrast, male farmers, particularly in Java, are more concerned about social restrictions due to limited mobility. Food price spikes were reported in both regions, with sharp increases for fish, fruits, and vegetables in Java, for staples in Toraja, and for meat and sugar in both regions. Food groups, that trade through agents and brokers or are transported longer distances were affected most due to their complex and long supply chains that were disrupted during the restrictions. In Java, farmers face multiple shocks, of which climate change was reported even more often than the pandemic related shocks. Not being able to help each other on the farm due to social distancing is a significant concern of farmers in Toraja. As a result of food market disturbances, farmers began to grow and eat more vegetables and fruits. In conclusion, food security for farmers slightly decreased due to affordability, and market disruptions already point to long-term income losses. The study team recommends to promote smallholders' healthy food production, value addition and direct end-consumer linkages to build back better their livelihoods post-COVID-19. © 2021.

University Hospital Institute-Méditerranée Infection performs real-time surveillance of all diagnoses of infections and associated deaths in public hospitals in Marseille, Southeastern France. This study compared mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. In 2019-2020, 50 patients (0.10% of 49,043 patients hospitalized) died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus; seven and seven deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and RSV, respectively. Additionally, 55 patients died after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was thus significantly lower for common respiratory viruses in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.003), primarily as a consequence of a decrease in influenza A virus (-83%) and RSV (-46%)-associated deaths. Overall, the proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was higher, but not significantly, in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (214 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.08, Yates-corrected Chi-square test).

Such algorithms are trained using historical data and are later implemented in clinical settings. During this implementation period, predictive algorithms are prone to performance changes (“drift”) due to exogenous shocks in utilization or shifts in patient characteristics. Our objective was to examine the impact of sudden utilization shifts during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the performance of an electronic health record (EHR)-based prognostic algorithm. STUDY DESIGN: We studied changes in the performance of Conversation Connect, a validated machine learning algorithm that predicts 180-day mortality among outpatients with cancer receiving care at medical oncology practices within a large academic cancer center. Conversation Connect generates mortality risk predictions before each encounter using data from 159 EHR variables collected in the six months before the encounter. Since January 2019, Conversation Connect has been used as part of a behavioral intervention to prompt clinicians to consider early advance care planning conversations among patients with ≥ 10% mortality risk. First, we descriptively compared encounter-level characteristics in the following periods: January 2019–February 2020 (“pre-pandemic”), March-May 2020 (“early-pandemic”), and June–December 2020 (“later-pandemic”). Second, we quantified changes in high-risk patient encounters using interrupted time series analyses that controlled for pre-pandemic trends and demographic, clinical, and practice covariates. Our primary metric of performance drift was false negative rate (FNR). Third, we assessed contributors to performance drift by comparing distributions of key EHR inputs across periods and predicting later pandemic utilization using pre-pandemic inputs. POPULATION STUDIED: 237,336 in-person and telemedicine medical oncology encounters. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Age, race, average patient encounters per month, insurance type, comorbidity counts, laboratory values, and overall mortality were similar among encounters in the pre-, early-, and later-pandemic periods. Relative to the pre-pandemic period, the later-pandemic period was characterized by a 6.5-percentage-point decrease (28.2% vs. 34.7%) in high-risk encounters (p<0.001). FNR increased from 41.0% (95% CI 38.0–44.1%) in the pre-pandemic period to 57.5% (95% CI 51.9–63.0%) in the later pandemic period. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the early and later pandemic periods had higher proportions of telemedicine encounters (0.01% pre-pandemic vs. 20.0% early-pandemic vs. 26.4% later-pandemic) and encounters with no preceding laboratory draws (17.7% pre-pandemic vs. 19.8% early-pandemic vs. 24.1% later-pandemic). In the later pandemic period, observed laboratory utilization was lower than predicted (76.0% vs 81.2%, p<0.001). In the later-pandemic period, mean 180-day mortality risk scores were lower for telemedicine encounters vs. in-person encounters (10.3% vs 11.2%, p<0.001) and encounters with no vs. any preceding laboratory draws (1.5% vs. 14.0%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period, the performance of a machine learning prognostic algorithm used to prompt advance care planning declined substantially. Increases in telemedicine and declines in laboratory utilization contributed to lower performance. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: This is the first study to show algorithm performance drift due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related shifts in telemedicine and laboratory utilization. These mechanisms of performance drift could apply to other EHR clinical predictive algorithms. Pandemic-related decreases in care utilization may negatively impact the performance of clinical predictive algorithms and warrant assessment and possible retraining of such algorithms.\\ntitle: Performance Drift in a Mortality Prediction Algorithm during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 418}), Document(page_content='abstract: The objective of this manuscript is to understand whether the policies regarding tourism and transport affect positively citizens ‘trust in local institutions.

The current study aims to identify the challenges and facilitators of implementing this program in a Chinese mental health service setting. METHODS: Two focus groups were conducted using semi-structured interviews with a total of 7 health care providers in Beijing. An adapted grounded theory methodology using open-ended, axial and selective coding was used for data analysis. RESULTS: We identified three main levels related to barriers and facilitators: (1) a sociocultural level of patients\\' and health care providers\\' perspectives; (2) a structural level related to internal and external organizational environments; (3) and the level of the intervention itself with its characteristics. The project is generally aligned with the mandates and goals of the health system, but two of the main obstacles are the varying qualifications of physicians in hospitals of different levels, implying different needs and flexible and adapted training programs, and the lack of appropriate patient referral systems between the different hospital levels.

We assessed serum IgG antibodies to a 14-wide antigen panel of structural and accessory proteins by Luciferase Immuno-Precipitation System (LIPS) assay and circulating cytokines. Infected children have lower levels of Spike, Membrane, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF7b antibodies, comparable ORF8 and elevated E-specific antibodies than adults. Combination of two unique antibody targets, ORF3d and ORF8, can accurately discriminate SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Principal component analysis reveals distinct pediatric serological signatures, and the highest contribution to variance from adults are antibody responses to non-structural proteins ORF3d, NSP1, ORF3a and ORF8. From a diverse panel of cytokines that can modulate immune priming and relative inflammation, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-6 correlate with the magnitude of pediatric antibody specificity and severity.

Drug repurposing is a well-known method to address the crisis in a time-critical fashion. Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been reported to inhibit DNA replication of hepatitis B virus, measles virus germination, and HIV infection, along with replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which interact with host cells as SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Nineteen APDs were screened using ACE2-HEK293T cell membrane chromatography (ACE2-HEK293T/CMC). Cytotoxicity assay, coronavirus spike pseudotype virus entry assay, surface plasmon resonance, and virtual molecular docking were applied to detect affinity between ACE2 protein and drugs and a potential antiviral property of the screened compounds. KEY FINDINGS: After the CMC screening, 8 of the 19 APDs were well-retained on ACE2-HEK293T/CMC column and showed significant antiviral activities in vitro. Three quarters of them belong to phenothiazine and could significantly inhibit the entrance of coronavirus into ACE2-HEK293T cells. Aother two drugs, aripiprazole and tiapride, exhibited weaker inhibition. We selected five of the drugs for subsequent evaluation. All five showed similar affinity to ACE2 and virtual molecular docking demonstrated they bound with different amino acids respectively on ACE2 which SARS-CoV-2 binds to. SIGNIFICANCE: Eight APDs were screened for binding with ACE2, five of which demonstrated potential protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 through acting on ACE2.

The aim of this study is to determine the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 using indices such as deterioration in oxygenation and CT images of the chest. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study of 53 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in Narita who were admitted to our hospital between March 2020 and August 2020. CACS was calculated based on non-gated CT scans of the chest performed on admission day. The patients were divided into the following two groups based on CACS: group 1 (CACS ≥180, n=11) and group 2 (CACS <180, n=42). Following univariate analysis of the main variables, multivariate analysis of variables that may be associated with COVID-19 progression was performed. RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis of age, sex, smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, number of days from symptom onset to hospitalisation and CACS of ≥180 was performed. It revealed that unlike CACS of <180, CACS of ≥180 is associated with exacerbation of oxygenation or CT images of the chest during hospitalisation (OR: 12.879, 95% CI: 1.399 to 380.401). Furthermore, this model of eight variables showed good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=0.119). CONCLUSION: CACS may be a prognosis marker of COVID-19 severity.

The thematic analysis was employed to analyze data. The results revealed that only a small number of the participants had received the COVID-19 vaccine; they experienced soreness and itchiness, and their motive for receiving the vaccine was its availability. The participants who had not received the vaccine reported the following as determinants of their willingness to receive the vaccine: “concerns about the side/adverse effect”, “the perceived benefit of receiving the vaccine”, “mistrust (in the pharmaceutical companies that produced the vaccine, the vaccine itself, or governments)”, “the need for clarity of information on the vaccine”, and “moral obligation to receive the vaccine”. The participants who had not received the vaccine further reported the following as other barriers that limit them from receiving the vaccine: “unavailability of the vaccine in the country of residence”, “non-membership to a high-risk group”, and “membership to a minority group”. In terms of what governments can do to encourage public uptake of the vaccine, many participants reported: “provide clear information on the COVID-19 vaccine”, “endorsement by public figures”, “make the vaccine free to receive”, “introduce rewards and punishments”, and “honesty from governments”.

Little is known about the experiences of critical care physicians caring for the sickest coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Our goal is to understand how high stress levels and shortages faced by these physicians during Spring 2020 have evolved. DESIGN We surveyed (October 23, 2020 to November 16, 2020) U.S. critical care physicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients who participated in a National survey earlier in the pandemic (April 23, 2020 to May 3, 2020) regarding their stress and shortages they faced. SETTING ICU. PATIENTS Coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTION Irrelevant. MEASUREMENT Physician emotional distress/physical exhaustion: low (not at all/not much), moderate, or high (a lot/extreme). Shortage indicators: insufficient ICU-trained staff and shortages in medication, equipment, or personal protective equipment requiring protocol changes. MAIN RESULTS Of 2,375 U.S. critical care attending physicians who responded to the initial survey, we received responses from 1,356 (57.1% response rate), 97% of whom (1,278) recently treated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Two thirds of physicians (67.6% [864]) reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress in the Spring versus 50.7% (763) in the Fall. Reports of staffing shortages persisted with 46.5% of Fall respondents (594) reporting a staff shortage versus 48.3% (617) in the Spring. Meaningful shortages of medication and equipment reported in the Spring were largely alleviated. Although personal protective equipment shortages declined by half, they remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS Stress, staffing, and, to a lesser degree, personal protective equipment shortages faced by U.S. critical care physicians remain high. Stress levels were higher among women.

The convalescent serum from B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-infected patients neutralized the variants themselves better than other SARS-CoV-2 variants.\\ntitle: Comparison of 10 emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants: infectivity, animal tropism, and antibody neutralization', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 433}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Anisin casts a critical eye on how the Western-sponsored liberal international order has contended with the international crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic both to politics and global economic governance Health emergencies of a scale and intensity as witnessed in the case of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) are rare Both papers show how the COVID-19 crisis presents opportunities to challenge the longstanding challenges of postcolonial state [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Politikon: South African Journal of Political Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )\\ntitle: COVID-19, Politics and International Relations: hopes and impediments\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 434}), Document(page_content='abstract: Mutated forms of the coronavirus from the UK and South Africa are providing fresh challenges for controlling the pandemic, reports Michael Le Page\\ntitle: Threats from new variants', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 435}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Bats are known reservoirs of Nipah virus (NiV) and some filoviruses and also appear likely to harbor the evolutionary progenitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While bats are considered a reservoir of deadly viruses, little is known about people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat conservation and ecology. The current study aimed to assess community people's knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat ecology, myths, and the role of bats in transmitting NiV in Bangladesh. Since 2001, NiV has been a continuous threat to public health with a mortality rate of approximately 70% in Bangladesh. Over the years, many public health interventions have been implemented to raise awareness about bats and the spreading of NiV among the community peoples of Nipah outbreak areas (NOAs) and Nipah non-outbreak areas (NNOAs). We hypothesized that people from both areas might have similar knowledge of bat ecology and myths about bats but different knowledge regarding their role in the spreading of NiV. Using a four-point Likert scale-based questionnaire, our analysis showed that most people lack adequate knowledge regarding the role of bats in maintaining the ecological balance and instead trust their beliefs in different myths about bats. Factor score analysis showed that respondents' gender (p = 0.01), the outbreak status of the area (p = 0.03), and their occupation (p = 0.04) were significant factors influencing their knowledge of bat ecology and myths. A regression analysis showed that farmers had 0.34 times the odds of having correct or positive knowledge of bat ecology and myths than businesspersons (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.15-0.78, p = 0.01). Regarding the spreading of NiV via bats, people had a lower level of knowledge. In NOAs, age (p = 0.00), occupation (p = 0.00), and level of education (p = 0.00) were found to be factors contributing to the amount of knowledge regarding the transmission of NiV, whereas in NNOAs, the contributing factors were occupation (p = 0.00) and level of education (p = 0.01). Regression analysis revealed that respondents who were engaged in services (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.07-8.54, p = 0.04) and who had completed primary education (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.02-9.17, p < 0.05) were likely to have correct knowledge regarding the spreading of NiV. Based on the study results, we recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and conservation of bats so as to improve people's current knowledge and subsequent behavior regarding the role of bats in ecology and the spreading of NiV in Bangladesh.\\ntitle: Understanding the Community Perceptions and Knowledge of Bats and Transmission of Nipah Virus in Bangladesh\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 436}), Document(page_content='abstract: Cisgender women, particularly pregnant and postpartum women in Eastern and Southern Africa, face an unacceptably high risk of HIV acquisition.

This study systematically reviewed available evidence on effectiveness of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines in the general population, for improved vaccine policies and strategies. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Using several keywords, a search of Scopus, PubMed, Google scholar and Hinari databases was conducted from December 1, 2020 to June 9, 2021. Eligible studies comprising original studies reporting effectiveness of the vaccines, were included following PRISMA guidelines. Individual studies were assessed for quality using National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute quality assessment tool. A total of 1766 titles were retrieved and 11 were included, out of which only 5 were peer-reviewed. Although data availability was limited, studies suggest equivalent effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. Vaccine effectiveness increased steadily to about 35 days, with an enhanced effectiveness following the second dose. SHORT CONCLUSION: BNT162 and ChAdOx1 vaccines were associated with equivalent and high effectiveness which increased with time and a second dose in the general population. This encourages continued practice of other preventive measures, particularly during the first week of vaccination, and reinforces the need for a second dose.\\ntitle: A systematic review of effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines in the general population', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 438}), Document(page_content='abstract: Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted health-care delivery globally, especially for non-COVID diseases.

Material and Methods: This observational, cross-sectional cohort study was performed on the data of a 710 bedded, multispecialty, and tertiary care corporate hospital of the national capital of India. The data of the pandemic period (April 1, 2020-March 31, 2021) were divided into three main groups and were then compared with the patient data of the preceding non-pandemic year (April 1, 2019-March 31, 2020) of more than six hundred thousand cases.\\ntitle: Severe impact of COVID-19 pandemic on non-COVID patient care and health delivery: an observational study from a large multispecialty hospital of India', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 439}), Document(page_content='abstract: Protein intake has been reported to secrete insulin and lower glucose levels, but the effect of carbohydrate and protein co-ingestion on amino acid absorption has not been well documented. A randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of sucrose on blood amino acid levels. Eleven volunteers (both sexes aged 20–60 years with body mass index 21.4 ± 2.4 kg/m(2)) randomly received one of four test solutions: water (P-group), 10 g sucrose (S-group), 10 g whey protein (W-group), or 10 g whey protein + 10 g sucrose (W-S-group), and blood amino acid concentration, glucose levels, and insulin levels were monitored over 180 min. Following the wash-out period, randomized treatment and blood parameter monitoring were repeated. Consequently, amino acid concentration was significantly lower in the S-group than in the P-group, showing that single ingestion of sucrose decreased blood amino acid levels in a fasted state. However, there was no significant difference between blood amino acid levels of the W- and W-S-groups, suggesting that co-ingestion of sucrose does not affect blood amino acid concentration. Insulin levels were significantly higher in the W-S than in the S-group, and glucose levels were significantly lower in the W-S- than in the S-group, suggesting positive impact on glycotoxicity by reducing blood glucose levels. Therefore, whey protein co-ingestion with sucrose suppresses glucose levels and increases insulin levels as opposed to the sucrose ingestion, but does not affect amino acid absorption of whey protein, indicating that this co-ingestion may not be a problem for protein supplementation.\\ntitle: Effect of Sucrose on Amino Acid Absorption of Whey: A Randomized Crossover Trial', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 440}), Document(page_content='abstract: NETosis is a type of regulated cell death dependent on the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), where net-like structures of decondensed chromatin and proteases are produced by polymorphonuclear (PMN) granulocytes.

Whilst NETs possess a fundamental anti-microbial function within the innate immune system under physiological circumstances, increasing evidence also indicates that NETosis occurs in the pathogenic process of other disease type, including but not limited to atherosclerosis, airway inflammation, Alzheimer’s and stroke. Here, we reviewed the role of NETosis in the development of organ injury, including injury to the brain, lung, heart, kidney, musculoskeletal system, gut and reproductive system, whilst therapeutic agents in blocking injuries induced by NETosis in its primitive stages were also discussed.

The virus is highly contagious and spread rapidly and the number of infections increases exponentially. The high excessive number of patients and presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in human excreta and urine even after the infected person’s respiratory tests were negative, results in heavy load of viral in various water bodies. Numerous studies reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. The risk of contaminating water bodies in the regions which suffer from the lack of proper sanitation system and wastewater treatment plants (mostly in developing countries) is higher. Since solar water disinfection (SODIS) is usually used by people in developing countries, there is a concern about using this method during the pandemic. Because the SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated by high temperature (>56°C) and UVC wavelength (100-280 nm) while SODIS systems mainly work at lower temperature (<45°C) and use the available UVA (315-400 nm). Thus, during a situation like the ongoing pandemic using SODIS method for wastewater treatment (or providing drinking water) is not a reliable method. It should be reminded that the main aim of the present study is not just to give insights about the possibilities and risks of using SODIS during the ongoing pandemic but it has broader prospect for any future outbreak/pandemic that results in biological contamination of water bodies. Nevertheless, some experimental studies seem to be necessary by all researchers under conditions similar to developing countries.\\ntitle: Effectiveness of solar water disinfection in the era of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic for contaminated water/wastewater treatment considering UV effect and temperature', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 442}), Document(page_content='abstract: Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are used as a phenotypic marker in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders.

As little is currently known about usage and structure of ultrasonic vocalizations during social interactions over the long-term and in unconstrained context, we investigated mouse spontaneous communication by coupling the analysis of USVs with automatic labeling of behaviors. We continuously recorded during 3 days undisturbed interactions of same-sex pairs of C57BL/6J sexually naive males and females at 5 weeks and 3 and 7 months of age. In same-sex interactions, we observed robust differences between males and females in the amount of USVs produced, in the acoustic structure and in the contexts of emission. The context-specific acoustic variations emerged with increasing age. The emission of USVs also reflected a high level of excitement during social interactions. We finally highlighted the importance of studying long-term spontaneous communication by investigating female mice lacking Shank3, a synaptic protein associated with autism. While the previous short-time constrained investigations could not detect USV emission abnormalities, our analysis revealed robust differences in the usage and structure of the USVs emitted by mutant mice compared to wild-type female pairs.\\ntitle: LMT USV Toolbox, a Novel Methodological Approach to Place Mouse Ultrasonic Vocalizations in Their Behavioral Contexts-A Study in Female and Male C57BL/6J Mice and in Shank3 Mutant Females', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 443}), Document(page_content='abstract: Abstract Background: Making testing available to everyone and tracing contacts might be the gold standard towards the control of COVID-19, particularly when significant transmissions are without symptoms.

Football leagues were suddenly stopped, and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019–2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.

MAIN BODY: We conducted a scoping review using EMBASE, CINAHL and MEDLINE databases of studies published in English focused on quality nursing care and with identified measurement methods. Indicators identified were reviewed by a diverse panel of nursing stakeholders in Kenya to develop a contextually appropriate set of nurse-sensitive indicators for Kenyan hospitals specific to the five major inpatient disciplines. We extracted data on study characteristics, nursing indicators reported, location and the tools used. A total of 23 articles quantifying the quality of nursing care services met the inclusion criteria. All studies identified were from high-income countries. Pooled together, 159 indicators were reported in the reviewed studies with 25 identified as the most commonly reported. Through the stakeholder consultative process, 52 nurse-sensitive indicators were recommended for Kenyan hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Although nurse-sensitive indicators are increasingly used in high-income countries to improve quality of care, there is a wide heterogeneity in the way indicators are defined and interpreted. Whilst some indicators were regarded as useful by a Kenyan expert panel, contextual differences prompted them to recommend additional new indicators to improve the evaluations of nursing care provision in Kenyan hospitals and potentially similar LMIC settings.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This study (NCT02476123) comprised dose-escalation (3+3 design) and expansion parts. Patients received nivolumab (3.0 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, with mogamulizumab (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg in dose-escalation, 1.0 mg/kg in expansion) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks, until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was safety; secondary objectives were antitumor effects, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted. RESULTS 96 patients were enrolled (July 2015-November 2016): six patients in the dose-escalation part and 90 in the expansion part. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the dose-escalation part. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 29% of patients in the expansion part (no grade 5 TRAEs). The most frequent TRAEs were rash (39%), rash maculo-papular (20%), diarrhea (13%), stomatitis (12%), and pruritus (11%). There were four (27%) confirmed tumor responses among 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and one confirmed and two unconfirmed responses among 15 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

The most common reasons for hesitancy were fear of side effects (reported by 88%). Mild side effects were common but no participant reported severe side effects. Half of participants changed their social contact behaviour after vaccination by seeing friends and family more often. The high vaccination willingness in the study population might reflect the extraordinary effort taken by PCD support groups to inform people about COVID-19 vaccination.

Emergency department crowding and associated AOD are exacerbated by multiple factors, including infectious disease outbreaks such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Initiatives to address AOD present an opportunity to streamline ambulance offload procedures while improving patient outcomes. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the initial outcomes and impact of a novel Emergency Medical Service (EMS)-based Hospital Liaison Program (HLP) on ambulance offload times (AOTs). METHODS: Ambulance offload times associated with EMS patients transported to a community hospital six months before and after HLP implementation were retrospectively analyzed using proportional significance tests, t-tests, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: A proportional increase in incidents in the zero to <30 minutes time category after program implementation (+2.96%; P <.01) and a commensurate decrease in the proportion of incidents in the 30 to <60 minutes category (-2.65%; P <.01) were seen. The fully adjusted regression model showed AOT was 16.31% lower (P <.001) after HLP program implementation, holding all other variables constant. CONCLUSION: The HLP is an innovative initiative that constitutes a novel pathway for EMS and hospital systems to synergistically enhance ambulance offload procedures. The greatest effect was demonstrated in patients exhibiting potentially life-threatening symptoms, with a reduction of approximately three minutes. While small, this outcome was a statistically significant decrease from the pre-intervention period.

Calves fed colostrum with high TCC had increased chances of suffering pneumonia (51.4 vs. 42.1%; P < 0.05) than calves fed colostrum with lower TCC. Calves fed colostrum with ≥85 mg Ig/mL tended to present higher daily weight gain (505 ± 113 vs. 484 ± 126 g; P = 0.09). TBC and TCC in colostrum did not influence the incidence rate of diarrhea. It was concluded that under the conditions of the present study, heavy contamination of on‐farm pasteurized frozen–thawed colostrum is seemingly unavoidable and this contamination poses a threat for pneumonia, but not for diarrhea.\\ntitle: Effect of quality of colostrum on health, growth and immunoglobulin G concentration in Holstein calves in a hot environment', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 456}), Document(page_content='abstract: High-fidelity models are increasingly used to predict, and guide decision making. Prior work has emphasized the importance of replication in ensuring reliable modeling, and has yielded important replication strategies. However, this work is based on relatively simple theory generating models, and its lessons might not translate to high-fidelity models used for decision support. Using NetLogo we replicate a recently published high-fidelity model examining the effects of a HIV biomedical intervention. We use a modular approach to build our model from the ground up, and provide examples of the replication process investigating the replication of two sub-modules as well as the overall simulation experiment. For the first module, we achieved numerical identity during replication, whereas we obtained distributional equivalence in replicating the second module. We achieved relational equivalence among the overall model behaviors, with a 0.98 correlation across the two implementations for our outcome measure even without strictly following the original model in the formation of the sexual network. Our results show that replication of high-fidelity models is feasible when following a set of systematic strategies that leverage the modularity, and highlight the role of replication standards, modular testing, and functional code in facilitating such strategies.\\ntitle: Leveraging Modularity During Replication of High-Fidelity Models: Lessons from Replicating an Agent-Based Model for HIV Prevention.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 457}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: This paper estimates the economic impact of the non‐pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by countries in Europe and Central Asia during the initial stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The analysis relies on daily electricity consumption, nitrogen dioxide emission and mobility records to trace the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic and calibrate these measures to estimate the magnitude of the economic impact. To address the potential endogeneity in the introduction of NPIs, we instrument their stringency by the extent of a country's social ties to China. The results suggest that the NPIs led to a decline of about 10% in economic activity across the region. On average, countries that implemented non‐pharmaceutical interventions in the early stages of the pandemic appear to have better short‐term economic outcomes and lower cumulative mortality, compared with countries that imposed non‐pharmaceutical interventions during the later stages of the pandemic. Moreover, there is evidence that COVID‐19 mortality at the peak of the local outbreak has been lower in countries that acted earlier. In this sense, the results suggest that the sooner non‐pharmaceutical interventions are implemented, the better are the economic and health outcomes.\\ntitle: The sooner, the better: The economic impact of non‐pharmaceutical interventions during the early stage of the COVID‐19 pandemic\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 458}), Document(page_content='abstract: The steady spread of the 2019 Coronavirus disease has brought about human and economic losses, imposing a new lifestyle across the world.

Deep learning methodologies have evidenced superior image analysis capabilities with respect to prior handcrafted counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for Coronavirus detection using CT and X-ray images. In particular, a Vision Transformer architecture is adopted as a backbone in the proposed network, in which a Siamese encoder is utilized. The latter is composed of two branches: one for processing the original image and another for processing an augmented view of the original image. The input images are divided into patches and fed through the encoder. The proposed framework is evaluated on public CT and X-ray datasets. The proposed system confirms its superiority over state-of-the-art methods on CT and X-ray data in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. Furthermore, the proposed system also exhibits good robustness when a small portion of training data is allocated.\\ntitle: COVID-19 Detection in CT/X-ray Imagery Using Vision Transformers', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 459}), Document(page_content='abstract: Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are important causes of infection in children. However, without a comprehensive and persistent surveillance, the epidemiology and clinical features of HPeV infection remain ambiguous. We performed a hospital-based surveillance study among three groups of pediatric patients with acute respiratory infection (Group 1), acute diarrhea (Group 2), and hand, foot and mouth disease (Group 3) in Chongqing, China, from 2009 to 2015. Among 10,212 tested patients, 707 (6.92%) were positive for HPeV, with the positive rates differing significantly among three groups (Group 1, 3.43%; Group 2, 14.94%; Group 3, 3.55%; P < 0.001). The co-infection with other pathogens was detected in 75.2% (531/707) of HPeV-positive patients. Significant negative interaction between HPeV and Parainfluenza virus (PIV) (P = 0.046, OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.34–0.98) and positive interactions between HPeV and Enterovirus (EV) (P = 0.015, OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.23–4.73) were identified. Among 707 HPeV-positive patients, 592 (83.73%) were successfully sequenced, and 10 genotypes were identified, with HPeV1 (n = 396), HPeV4 (n = 86), and HPeV3 (n = 46) as the most frequently seen. The proportion of genotypes differed among three groups (P < 0.001), with HPeV1 and HPeV4 overrepresented in Group 2 and HPeV6 overrepresented in Group 3. The spatial patterns of HPeV genotypes disclosed more close clustering of the currently sequenced strains than those from other countries/regions, although they were indeed mixed. Three main genotypes (HPeV1, HPeV3, and HPeV4) had shown distinct seasonal peaks, highlighting a bi-annual cycle of all HpeV and two genotypes (HPeV 1 and HPeV 4) with peaks in odd-numbered years and with peaks in even-numbered years HPeV3. Significantly higher HPeV1 viral loads were associated with severe diarrhea in Group 2 (P = 0.044), while associated with HPeV single infection than HPeV-EV coinfection among HFMD patients (P = 0.001). It’s concluded that HPeV infection was correlated with wide clinical spectrum in pediatric patients with a high variety of genotypes determined.

The aim of the study was to explore the factors influencing service user and family engagement with group psychoeducation programmes. The study design was qualitative descriptive. Data were collected through individual and focus group interviews with key stakeholders (n = 75) involved with the programme within 14 mental health sites in the Republic of Ireland. Enablers and barriers to engagement were identified at participant, provider, programme and organization level. Motivated participants and engaged clinicians, peer co-facilitation and support, and skilled and responsive facilitators were some of the factors which enhanced engagement. Barriers to engagement included readiness among participants, concerns related to stigma and confidentiality, desire to distance oneself from mental health services, a lack of support for programme participation within families, group discomfort, the time and length of the programme, issues with transport, visibility of the programme, and structural supports for clinicians. Findings from the study illustrate the multifaceted nature of engagement as well as provide a greater understanding of the multifactorial influences on engagement. Strategies to enhance engagement should therefore reflect a multipronged approach. At the outset of programme implementation, organizations should address their readiness to engage, conduct local needs assessments to anticipate individuals' needs and plan accordingly in order to maximize engagement, and bolster facilitators' engagement skills through the provision of training and mentoring opportunities.\\ntitle: Factors Influencing Attendees' Engagement with Group Psychoeducation: A Multi-stakeholder Perspective.\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 461}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Introduction: A chorionic bump is an increasingly recognized ultrasound finding in first-trimester scans, which has been associated with early pregnancy loss. In ongoing second-trimester pregnancies, however, chorionic bumps usually resolve over time with no deleterious effect on the fetus. In this report, we describe the incidental ultrasound detection of a chorionic bump in early pregnancy and its progression to a subamniotic hematoma in the second trimester of pregnancy that persisted as such until delivery. Case Report: A round, echogenic mass protruding from the choriodecidual surface measuring 13 × 11 × 8 mm was first identified during a transvaginal scan at 6.3 weeks' gestation. Subsequent follow-up scan at 8.3 weeks revealed an increase in the size of the chorionic bump to 25 × 20 × 19 mm, which remained stable as determined by the routine late first-trimester scan. At the second-trimester scan, a subamniotic hematoma was identified in the surface of the placenta, close to the insertion of the umbilical cord. Subsequently, the pregnancy proceeded uneventfully. Discussion: The etiopathology and clinical significance of a chorionic bump remain unclear. The case herein reported demonstrates that a chorionic bump can grow considerably without having a deleterious effect on the early embryo and, occasionally, can persist throughout pregnancy as a subamniotic hematoma. Conclusion: A chorionic bump can occasionally progress to a subamniotic hematoma from the second trimester onwards. This observation further supports the hypothesis that a chorionic bump is the result of choriodecidual bleeding.

However, the theoretical aspects and polysemous character of social justice as applied in the field of public health are often assumed rather than explicitly explained. An intersectional justice approach to understanding health inequality, inequity, and injustice might be useful. It argues that preexisting class-, race/ethnicity-, and gender-based health injustice and the socially differentiated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are shaped, interconnectedly, by economic maldistribution, cultural misrecognition, and political misrepresentation. Pursuing health justice requires analyses, strategies, and interventions that integrate the economic, cultural, and political spheres of redistribution, recognition, and representation, respectively. Such an intersectional approach to health justice is even more relevant and compelling in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we systematically dissected the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed an enrichment for immune response, cytokine mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed an enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs and HNRNPs illustrating the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed the potential for several miRs to be sponged, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to altered pos-transcriptional regulation across human tissues.

Food consumption was evaluated through: (1) consumption of five or more portions of fruits and vegetables in ≥5 d/week; (2) consumption of beans in ≥5 d/week and (3) consumption of soft drinks or artificial juices in ≥5 d/week. Absolute inequality was assessed by the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative inequality by the concentration index (CIX). SII and CIX positive values indicate higher prevalence among more educated citizens and negative among less educated ones. Time trend was assessed by linear regression using weighted least squares. SETTING: 26 Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District. PARTICIPANTS: 621 689 individuals ≥18 years. RESULTS: Fruits and vegetable consumption was more prevalent among the more educated citizens, while beans were mostly consumed by the less educated, and soft drinks or artificial juices was more prevalent among individuals with intermediate education. The highest absolute inequality was found for beans (SII(2019) -25·9). In 12 years, the absolute inequality increased for fruit and vegetable consumption (from SII(2008) 12·8 to SII(2019) 16·2), remained for beans (SII(2008) -23·1 to SII(2019) -25·9) and reduced for soft drinks or artificial juices (SII(2008) 8·7 to SII(2019) 0·4).

Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective. Moreover, the WASH and waste disposal practices of the marginal people were found very poor and not at a satisfactory level.

However, there remains uncertainty about the optimal oxygen titration target in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Prospectively identified adult patients meeting the Berlin definition of ARDS between 1st January 2014 and 13th December 2016 were analyzed. Oxygen exposure variables were collected at 6-hourly intervals. The primary exposure was the average time-weighted partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) calculated over a maximum of 7 days from meeting ARDS criteria. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of exposure variables on clinical outcomes. Results are presented as odds ratio [95% confidence interval]. RESULTS: 202 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall ICU mortality was 31%. The average time-weighted PaO(2) during the first 7 days of ARDS was similar between non-survivors and survivors (11.3 kPa [10.2, 12.5] (84.8 mmHg [76.5, 93.8]) vs. 11.9 kPa [10.9, 12.6] (89.3 mmHg [81.8, 94.5]); p = 0.08). In univariable and multivariable analysis, average time-weighted PaO(2) demonstrated a U-shaped relationship with ICU mortality. There was a similar relationship identified with hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ARDS, the predicted probability of both ICU and hospital mortality was lowest when the average time-weighted PaO(2) was between 12.5 and 14 kPa (93.8–105.0 mmHg), suggesting this is a reasonable oxygenation target for clinicians to aim for.

The first approach is more goal-focused while the latter is more autonomy-focused. Here we compared these two approaches in motor performance and psychological outcomes. Nineteen resistance-trained participants (10-males) first completed one repetition-maximum (RM) tests in the barbell-squat and bench-press, and were familiarized with the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP). In the next two counterbalanced sessions, participants completed two sets of the squat and bench-press using 70%1RM, and two sets of the IMTP. In the predetermined session, participants completed 10 repetitions in all sets, and in the self-selected session, participants chose how many repetitions to complete out of an 8–12 range. Bar-velocity was measured in the squat and bench-press, and force production in the IMTP. Enjoyment, perceived-autonomy, and approach-preferences were collected post-sessions. We observed comparable bar-velocity, force production, and enjoyment in both conditions (all BF(01) > 2.1), and an even approach-preferences split. However, in the self-selected condition, participants demonstrated considerable variability in the number of repetitions and reported greater perceived-autonomy. Given the similarities between approaches, both can be used with this cohort based on their personal-preference.

Spiritual coping with stress is an attempt to overcome the stress on the basis of what is transcendent. The use of spiritual coping strategies helps a person to overcome tensions caused by the work environment. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate occupational stress and its relationship with spiritual coping among ED nurses and EMS staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was descriptive-correlational research. Using convenience sampling methods, 516 ED nurses and EMS staff were enrolled in the study. The study instruments included demographic information, HSE Occupational Stress, and spiritual coping questionnaires. Data were analyzed using SPSSv.22 software and the descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation test, t-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The highest and lowest levels of occupational stress were the dimensions of “demand” (2.96 ± 0.65) and “role” (3.89 ± 0.81) respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that positive spiritual coping, negative spiritual coping, workplace, service location, type of employment, and work position were important factors affecting the occupational stress of ED nurses and EMS staff, which accounted for 0.34% of the variance. CONCLUSION: The findings showed the need to improve the work environment for ED nurses and EMS staff, including changes in physical working conditions, salaries, and better employment conditions. Training programs are recommended to reduce stress through the use of positive spiritual coping strategies.\\ntitle: Occupational stress and its relationship with spiritual coping among emergency department nurses and emergency medical services staff', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 479}), Document(page_content='abstract: Phenomenon of RNA-induced gene silencing is a highly conservative mechanism among eukaryotic organisms.

However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity. METHODS: We performed amplification of a human gene target (β-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by high Ct values for the human gene target β-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct. RESULTS: Low quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct values (slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with β-actin Ct values. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in NP specimen quality accounts for significant differences in the sensitivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.\\ntitle: Impact of Nasopharyngeal Specimen Quality on SARS-CoV-2 Test Sensitivity', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 481}), Document(page_content='abstract: Optic nerve cupping or enlargement of the cup-to-disc ratio is widely recognized as a feature of glaucoma, however it may also occur in non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies. The most well-recognized non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies that cause cupping include compressive optic neuropathies, arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathies, hereditary optic neuropathies, and optic neuritis. Cupping is thought to consist of two main components: prelaminar and laminar thinning. The former is a shallow form of cupping and related to loss of retinal ganglion cells, whereas the latter involves damage to the lamina cribrosa and peripapillary scleral connective tissue. Differentiating glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous optic nerve cupping remains challenging even for experienced observers. Classically, the optic nerve in non-glaucomatous causes has pallor of the neuroretinal rim, but the optic nerve should not be examined in isolation. The patient’s medical history, history of presenting illness, visual function (visual acuity, color vision and visual field testing) and ocular examination also need to be considered. Ancillary testing such as optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer may also be helpful in localizing the disease.

A network-based modelling and simulation (M&S) approach would (a) quantify the extent to which existing PHC, CHC and DH facilities can effectively cope with the forecasted COVID-19 patient load, whilst continuing to offer non-COVID-19 related care functions such as childbirth care, surgeries and outpatient clinics;(b) inform decisions on capacity at makeshift COVID-19 Care Centres (CCC) to handle patient overflows from the PHS;(c) enable identifying the optimal location of such makeshift facilities. We apply the network-based M&S approach to an empirical study of a local PHS comprising ten PHCs, three CHCs, one DH and one makeshift CCC, and report operational outcomes for existing PHS capacity and estimate the required capacity for the CCC under a specific pandemic response strategy. We identify the optimal location of the CCC through the combined application of the network simulation with a version of the stochastic ruler algorithm customized for this problem.

For such samples the localization and orientation of the molecular species or probe within the lipid bilayer environment is the focus of research prior to an evaluation of their dynamic or mechanistic behavior. X-ray scattering is a powerful method to study peptide/lipid interactions in the fluid, fully hydrated state of a lipid bilayer. For one, the lipid response can be revealed by observing membrane thickening and thinning as well as packing in the membrane plane; at the same time, the distinct positions of peptide moieties within lipid membranes can be elucidated at resolutions of up to several angstroms by applying heavy-atom labeling techniques. In this study, we describe a generally applicable X-ray scattering approach that provides robust and quantitative information about peptide insertion and localization as well as peptide/lipid interaction within highly oriented, hydrated multilamellar membrane stacks. To this end, we have studied an artificial, designed β-helical peptide motif in its homodimeric and hairpin variants adopting different states of oligomerization. These peptide lipid complexes were analyzed by grazing incidence diffraction (GID) to monitor changes in the lateral lipid packing and ordering. In addition, we have applied anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation as well as in-house X-ray reflectivity in combination with iodine-labeling in order to determine the electron density distribution ρ(z) along the membrane normal (z axis), and thereby reveal the hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as the position of certain amino acid side chains within the lipid bilayer. In the case of multiple labeling, the latter technique is not only applicable to demonstrate the peptide’s reconstitution but also to generate evidence about the relative peptide orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer.

Children underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent serological study for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: VIRCELL IgG assay. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen children from 69 HCWs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited: 47 children had positive IgG (41.6%). Children secondary attack rate was 43.7% (25% if both parents have had asymptomatic infection; 39.5% if one parent was symptomatic; and 47% when both parents had symptoms).

Making use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) summary statistics, we developed a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) framework to quantify the connectivity between three omics layers (DNA methylome (DNAm), transcriptome and proteome) and their cascading causal impact on complex traits and diseases. Results Evaluating 50 complex traits, we found that on average 37.8% (95% CI: [36.0%-39.5%]) of DNAm-to-trait effects were mediated through transcripts in the cis-region, while only 15.8% (95% CI: [11.9%-19.6%]) are mediated through proteins in cis. DNAm sites typically regulate multiple transcripts, and while found to predominantly decrease gene expression, this was only the case for 53.4% across ≈ 47,000 significant DNAm-transcript pairs. The average mediation proportion for transcript-to-trait effects through proteins (encoded for by the assessed transcript or located in trans) was estimated to be 5.27% (95%CI: [4.11%-6.43%]). Notable differences in the transcript and protein QTL architectures were detected with only 22% of protein levels being causally driven by their corresponding transcript levels. Several regulatory mechanisms were hypothesized including an example where cg10385390 (chr1:8’022’505) increases the risk of irritable bowel disease by reducing PARK7 transcript and protein expression.

Extensive crosstalk between the primary Ang II receptor, Ang type 1 receptor (AT1R), and the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) has been demonstrated by various groups in the last decade. Since activation of glial CB1R has been demonstrated to play a key role in the resolution of inflammatory states, we investigated the role of Ang II (100 nM) and/or ACEA (10 nM), a potent CB1R-specific agonist in the regulation of inflammatory markers in astrocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar rats. Astrocytes were cultured from brainstems and cerebellums of SHR and Wistar rats and assayed for IL1ß and IL10 gene expression and secreted fraction, in treated and non-treated cells, by employing qPCR and ELISA, respectively. mRNA expression of both IL10 and IL1ß were significantly elevated in untreated brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes isolated from SHR when compared to Wistar astrocytes. No changes were observed in the secreted fraction. While ACEA-treatment resulted in a significant increase in IL10 gene expression in Wistar brainstem astrocytes (Log2FC &#8805; 1, p < 0.05), its effect in SHR brainstem astrocytes was diminished. Ang II treatment resulted in a strong inhibitory effect on IL10 gene expression in astrocytes from both brain regions of SHR and Wistar rats (Log2FC &#8804; -1, p < 0.05), and an increase in IL1ß gene expression in brainstem astrocytes from both strains (Log2FC &#8805; 1, p < 0.05). Co-treatment of Ang II and ACEA resulted in neutralization of Ang II-mediated effect in Wistar brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes, but not SHR astrocytes. Neither Ang II nor ACEA resulted in any significant changes in IL10 or IL1ß secreted proteins. These data suggest that Ang II and ACEA have opposing roles in the regulation of inflammatory gene signature in astrocytes isolated from SHR and Wistar rats.

One way to gauge public sentiment regarding vaccines for the goal of increasing vaccination rates is by analyzing social media such as Twitter. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research was to understand public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing discussions about the vaccines on social media for a period of 60 days when the vaccines were started in the United States. Using the combination of topic detection and sentiment analysis, we identified different types of concerns regarding vaccines that were expressed by different groups of the public on social media. METHODS: To better understand public sentiment, we collected tweets for exactly 60 days starting from December 16, 2020 that contained hashtags or keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. We detected and analyzed different topics of discussion of these tweets as well as their emotional content. Vaccine topics were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization, and emotional content was identified using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis library as well as by using sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformer embeddings and comparing the embedding to different emotions using cosine similarity. RESULTS: After removing all duplicates and retweets, 7,948,886 tweets were collected during the 60-day time period. Topic modeling resulted in 50 topics; of those, we selected 12 topics with the highest volume of tweets for analysis. Administration and access to vaccines were some of the major concerns of the public. Additionally, we classified the tweets in each topic into 1 of the 5 emotions and found fear to be the leading emotion in the tweets, followed by joy. CONCLUSIONS: This research focused not only on negative emotions that may have led to vaccine hesitancy but also on positive emotions toward the vaccine. By identifying both positive and negative emotions, we were able to identify the public's response to the vaccines overall and to news events related to the vaccines.

The results showed that 212 respondents (58.24%) had a high level of smartphone addiction and 152 respondents (41.76%) had a low level of smartphone addiction. In addition, 187 respondents (51.37%) experienced mild insomnia, 87 respondents (23.9%) experienced moderate insomnia, 13 respondents (3.57%) experienced severe insomnia, and 77 respondents (21.15%) did not experience insomnia. Based on the results of data analysis, it was found that smartphone addiction had a significant relationship (p = 0.002) with weak and positive correlation (r = 0.162) to the incidence of insomnia. CONCLUSION: It was found that the majority of respondents experienced high levels of smartphone addiction and mild insomnia. Another finding suggests the higher addiction to the smartphones, the more severe insomnia suffered.\\ntitle: The association between smartphone addiction and insomnia incidence in students of the faculty of medicine udayana university batch of 2020 during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 501}), Document(page_content='abstract: As the United States population ages, a higher share of adults is likely to use long-term services and supports. This change increases physicians’ need for information about assisted living and residential care (AL/RC) settings, which provide supportive care and housing to older adults. Unlike skilled nursing facilities, states regulate AL/RC settings through varying licensure requirements enforced by state agencies, resulting in differences in the availability of medical and nursing services. Where some settings provide limited skilled nursing care, in others, residents rely on resident care coordinators, or their own physicians to oversee chronic conditions, medications, and treatments. The following narrative review describes key processes of care where physicians may interact with AL/RC operators, staff, and residents, including care planning, managing Alzheimer’s disease and related conditions, medication management, and end-of-life planning. Communication and collaboration between physicians and AL/RC operators are a crucial component of care management.\\ntitle: Revisiting the Role of Physicians in Assisted Living and Residential Care Settings', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 502}), Document(page_content='abstract: PURPOSE: On March 16, 2020, the Spanish government declared a state of alarm due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were restricted to remain confined at home, and medical visits were cancelled for 3 months. The impact of this lockdown on the manifestations of COPD and the quality-of-life of these patients has not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with COPD were interviewed by telephone from May 2–18, 2020. The interviews included questions about the lockdown, missed medical appointments, fears of the disease, possible COVID-19 infection, and exacerbations of COPD suffered during this period and their management. In addition, the COPD Assessment Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression, and the 5-Dimension Euro Quality-of-Life questionnaires were administered. RESULTS: Sixty-four (64%) patients claimed to have strictly complied with the lockdown, and only 42 (42%) stated they had left home at least once during lockdown. Only one patient (1%) was hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 13 (13%) patients presented an exacerbation of COPD self-managed at home with no admissions due to exacerbation of COPD during this period. A medical consultation or complementary test was cancelled in 90% of the patients, but 61% had a medical telephone visit with a high degree of satisfaction (mean 9.3/10). Most patients declared that their feeling regarding lung disease and general health was similar or even better during lockdown (82% and 81%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that in general lockdown had a low impact on COPD patients. Only one patient was affected by COVID-19, but moderate exacerbations of COPD were not infrequent. Although many medical visits and test were cancelled, patients were very satisfied with the medical telephone visits.\\ntitle: The Experience of COPD Patients in Lockdown Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 503}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Structure predictions suggest a partial conservation of RNA structure elements in coronavirus terminal genome regions.

The study aims to determine household incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI), lower (LRTI) and upper (URTI) respiratory infections within a primary care routine data and identify factors associated with the diseases’ incidence. METHODS: We conducted two five-year retrospective analyses of influenza-like illness (ILI), lower (LRTI) and upper (URTI) respiratory infections using the England Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network database; a cross-sectional study reporting incident rate ratio (IRR) from a negative binomial model and a retrospective cohort study, using a shared gamma frailty survival model, reporting hazard ratios (HR). We reported the following household characteristics: children < 5 years old, each extra household member, gender, ethnicity (reference white), chronic disease, pregnancy, and rurality. RESULTS: The IRR where there was a child < 5 years were 1·62 (1·38–1·89, p < 0·0001), 2·40 (2.04–2.83, p < 0·0001) and 4·46 (3.79–5.255, p < 0·0001) for ILI, LRTI and URTI respectively. IRR also increased with household size, rurality and presentations and by female gender, compared to male. Household incidence of URTI and LRTI changed little between years whereas influenza did and were greater in years with lower vaccine effectiveness. The HR where there was a child < 5 years were 2·34 (95%CI 1·88–2·90, p < 0·0001), 2·97 (95%CI 2·76–3·2, p < 0·0001) and 10·32 (95%CI 10.04–10.62, p < 0·0001) for ILI, LRTI and URTI respectively. HR were increased with female gender, rurality, and increasing household size.

Due to increased human activity, transportation, industrialization and urbanization create a detrimental effect on the global environment in terms of air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, soil pollution, climate change, ozone layer depletion and change of biodiversity and ecosystem. The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions and industrial shutdown during this pandemic so that on average, the air quality index (AQI) and five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, aerosol and carbon emissions) have decreased. During the ongoing lockdown, nature has started to revive itself. Rare birds and animals have starting to come out of hiding. People residing near Yamuna River in Delhi, India say that the water is cleaner due to the lockdown. The dip in air pollution is leading to clearer skies and migratory birds can fly freely without human interference or threat. It all seems like nature is taking a breath of fresh air with the lack of human activity. The present study discusses the indirect impact of covid-19 pandemic on environment and nature.

Summary Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to inflammatory pathogenesis in numerous conditions, including infectious and cardiovascular diseases, and have attracted attention as potential therapeutic targets. H2 acts as an antioxidant and has been clinically and experimentally proven to ameliorate inflammation. This study was performed to investigate whether H2 could inhibit NET formation and excessive neutrophil activation. Neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187 in H2-exposed or control media. Compared with control neutrophils, PMA- or A23187-stimulated human neutrophils exposed to H2 exhibited reduced neutrophil aggregation, citrullination of histones, membrane disruption by chromatin complexes, and release of NET components. CXCR4high neutrophils are highly prone to NETs, and H2 suppressed Ser-139 phosphorylation in H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, thereby suppressing the induction of CXCR4 expression. H2 suppressed both myeloperoxidase chlorination activity and production of reactive oxygen species to the same degree as N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid, while showing a more potent ability to inhibit NET formation than these antioxidants do in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. Although A23187 formed NETs in a reactive oxygen species–independent manner, H2 inhibited A23187-induced NET formation, probably via direct inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4-mediated histone citrullination. Inhalation of H2 inhibited the formation and release of NET components in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in animal models of lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis (mice and aged mini pigs).

This study aimed to examine the acute mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as well as coping strategies employed by disadvantaged community members in North India. METHODS: We used an intersectional lens for this qualitative study set in rural Tehri Garwhal and urban Dehradun districts of Uttarakhand, India. In-depth interviews were conducted in May 2020 during lockdown, by phone and in person using purposive selection, with people with disabilities, people living in slums with psychosocial disabilities and widows (total n = 24). We used the framework method for analysis following steps of transcription and translation, familiarisation, coding, developing and then applying a framework, charting and then interpreting data. FINDINGS: The participants with compounded disadvantage had almost no access to mobile phones, health messaging or health care and experienced extreme mental distress and despair, alongside hunger and loss of income. Under the realms of intrapersonal, interpersonal and social, six themes related to mental distress emerged: feeling overwhelmed and bewildered, feeling distressed and despairing, feeling socially isolated, increased events of othering and discrimination, and experiencing intersectional disadvantage. The six themes summarising coping strategies in the COVID-19 crisis were: finding sense and meaning, connecting with others, looking for positive ways forward, innovating with new practices, supporting others individually and collectively, and engaging with the natural world. CONCLUSIONS: People intersectionally disadvantaged by their social identity experienced high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 crisis, yet did not collapse, and instead described diverse and innovative strategies which enabled them to cope through the COVID-19 lockdown.

While general anesthesia (GA) is typically administered for ORIF, recent studies have also demonstrated promising results with the usage of regional anesthesia (RA) in the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures. This study will compare complication rates between the use of RA versus GA for ORIF of DRFs. METHODS: A multi-institutional surgical registry was utilized to identify patients who had undergone ORIF for DRFs from 2005 to 2018—these patients were stratified into GA and RA cohorts. Patients were matched utilizing coarsened-exact-matching (CEM) to compare postoperative outcomes and rates of 30-day complications were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Upon CEM-matching, 1191 patients receiving RA were matched to 9250 patients who had received GA, with a multivariate imbalance measure (L1) statistic of < 0.001. In the matched-cohort analysis, no significant differences were observed in rates of any complication (all p ≥ 0.083). On multivariate regression analyses, RA was not associated with increased risk for any complication (p = 0.445), minor complications (p = 0.093), major complications (p = 0.758), unplanned reoperations (p = 0.355), unplanned readmissions (p = 0.799), or mortality (p = 0.579). CONCLUSION: With similar safety profiles, RA is a safe and reasonable alternative to GA when managing DRFs surgically. RA may be the preferred anesthetic technique for ORIF of DRFs in patients at high risk with GA, such as those with reactions to GA in the past or with significant cardiopulmonary risk factors.

Data on the efficacy of remdesivir in Asian populations are limited, and conflicting results have been reported. The aim of the present study is to examine whether remdesivir is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 or not. Methods We evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir from data acquired from the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using five-to-one propensity score (PS) matching. Primary outcomes were overall risk of fatality, risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV/ECMO) and length of stay (LoS) in healthcare facilities. Results In total, 1907 of 15,225 patients met our inclusion criteria. After PS matching, 74 patients were assigned to the remdesivir case group and 195 patients to the non-remdesivir control group. In a PS-matched cohort, fatality risk (12.2% vs 13.3%; P = 1.0); risk of IMV/ECMO (5.4% vs 4.6%; P = 0.757); length of intensive care unit stay (6 vs 6 days; P = 0.473) and length of IMV (13 vs 5 days; P = 0.509) were not different between the case and control groups. LoS in the case group was longer than in the control group (14 vs 11 days; P < 0.001). Conclusions This study suggested that remdesivir may have no positive effect on clinical outcomes and reductions in invasive/non-invasive respiratory support for patients with COVID-19 in Japan.\\ntitle: Efficacy of remdesivir in Japanese patients hospitalised with COVID-19: A large observational study using the COVID-19 Registry Japan', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 523}), Document(page_content='abstract: Correlative imaging and quantification of intracellular nanoparticles with the underlying ultrastructure is crucial for understanding cell-nanoparticle interactions in biological research. However, correlative nanoscale imaging of whole cells still remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a straightforward nanoscopic approach for whole-cell correlative imaging, by simultaneous ionoluminescence and ultrastructure mapping implemented with a highly focused beam of alpha particles. We demonstrate that fluorescent nanodiamonds exhibit fast, ultrabright and stable emission upon excitation by alpha particles. Thus, by using fluorescent nanodiamonds as imaging probes, our approach enables quantification and correlative localization of single nanodiamonds within a whole cell at sub-30 nm resolution. As an application example, we show that our approach, together with Monte Carlo simulations and radiobiological experiments, can be employed to provide unique insights into the mechanisms of nanodiamond radiosensitization at the single whole-cell level. These findings may benefit clinical studies of radio-enhancement effects by nanoparticles in charged-particle cancer therapy.\\ntitle: Quantifying nanodiamonds biodistribution in whole cells with correlative iono-nanoscopy', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 524}), Document(page_content='abstract: Psychosocial stress has been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and death. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol slopes, which have also been associated with stress, might mediate this association. However, existing evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of dysregulated cortisol slopes remains limited and inconclusive. To elucidate whether dysregulated diurnal cortisol slopes are related to cardiovascular mortality, we assessed salivary cortisol and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 1090 participants from the KORA-F3 study, a prospective, observational cohort study of a random representative sample from the general population. Eighty-seven deaths were registered during the mean follow-up period of approximately 11 years, 31 of which were classified as cardiovascular deaths. A more pronounced cortisol awakening response was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality in the adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis (HR 0.59 [95-%-CI 0.36-0.96], p = 0.03). A greater diurnal cortisol peak-to-bedtime ratio at baseline also predicted a decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.50 [95-%-CI 0.34-0.73], p 0.01) and a decreased risk of stroke (HR 0.71 [95-%-CI 0.55-0.92], p 0.01). Increased levels of late night salivary cortisol predicted a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.49 [95-%-CI 1.13-1.97], p 0.01) and an increased risk of stroke (HR 1.24 [95-%-CI 1.01-1.52], p = 0.04). There was no association between measures of cortisol and non-cardiovascular related mortality. In conclusion, dysregulated diurnal cortisol patterns are associated with cardiovascular mortality, while greater diurnal cortisol variation seems to have a protective effect. This adds evidence to suggest a pathophysiological role of diurnal cortisol secretion patterns in cardiovascular health.\\ntitle: Dysregulated diurnal cortisol patterns are associated with cardiovascular mortality: Findings from the KORA-F3 study', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 525}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND Studies reporting the revisionary options for weight loss failure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) have been complex, underpowered, and lacking long-term data. We have previously shown that short-term (12-month) weight loss is achievable with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) for failed RYGB. To report the midterm outcomes of LAGB after RYGB failure. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively collected data before and after RYGB, when available, and before and after LAGB was performed at the New York Langone University Hospital (New York, NY). The data collected included weight, height, body mass index (BMI), gender, race, age, operative time, length of stay, postoperative complications, and the percentage of excess weight loss. RESULTS A total of 43 patients (9 men and 34 women) underwent LAGB after weight loss failure with RYGB. Of the 43 patients, 27 patients had undergone RYGB at other institutions, and preoperative RYGB data were available for 23 total patients. The average interval to LAGB was 6.6 years. The mean BMI before RYGB was 50.4 kg/m(2) and before LAGB was 43.3 kg/m(2) (%EWL was 17% after RYGB). At follow-up after LAGB, the average BMI was 35.2 kg/m(2), with a %EWL of 38% (calculated from LAGB only) at 26 months (range 6-66). At the 1- and 2-year follow-up visit, the BMI had decreased by 8.7 kg/m(2). The reoperation rate for complications related to LAGB was 10% and included 2 band erosions, 1 band slip, and 1 port flip.

Genomic epidemiology can support disease control by providing rapid inferences on viral evolution and disease transmission. In this study, genomic epidemiology was used to investigate salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the causative agent of pancreas disease (PD) in Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to reconstruct SAV subtype-2 (SAV2) diversity and transmission dynamics in recent Norwegian aquaculture, including the origin of SAV2 in regions where this subtype is not tolerated under current legislation. Using nanopore sequencing, we captured ~90% of the SAV2 genome for n = 68 field isolates from 10 aquaculture production regions sampled between 2018 and 2020. Using time-calibrated phylogenetics, we infer that, following its introduction to Norway around 2010, SAV2 split into two clades (SAV2a and 2b) around 2013. While co-present at the same sites near the boundary of Møre og Romsdal and Trøndelag, SAV2a and 2b were generally detected in non-overlapping locations at more Southern and Northern latitudes, respectively. We provide evidence for recent SAV2 transmission over large distances, revealing a strong connection between Møre og Romsdal and SAV2 detected in 2019/20 in Rogaland. We also demonstrate separate introductions of SAV2a and 2b outside the SAV2 zone in Sognefjorden (Vestland), connected to samples from Møre og Romsdal and Trøndelag, respectively, and a likely 100 km Northward transmission of SAV2b within Trøndelag. Finally, we recovered genomes of SAV2a and SAV3 co-infecting single fish in Rogaland, involving novel SAV3 lineages that diverged from previously characterized strains >25 years ago. Overall, this study demonstrates useful applications of genomic epidemiology for tracking viral disease spread in aquaculture.\\ntitle: Genomic Epidemiology of Salmonid Alphavirus in Norwegian Aquaculture Reveals Recent Subtype-2 Transmission Dynamics and Novel Subtype-3 Lineages', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 527}), Document(page_content='abstract: In May 2020, the Navajo Native American Research Center for Health Partnership (Navajo NARCH) was scheduled to launch two summer programs: a 10 weeks-long Summer Research Enhancement Program (SREP) for undergraduate students to learn and practice health research methods and participate in a practicum experience, and a week-long Indigenous Summer Enhancement Program (ISEP) for high school students that introduces a range of health professions and develops leadership qualities.

That was a prospective study. The study included 106 patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. All patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group included 51 patients without CVD, the second group included 55 patients with CVD .Patients in both groups underwent laboratory examination of blood samples at the time of hospitalization and 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Parameters of the erythroid series of the general blood test were assessed. Among inflammatory biomarkers, we examined the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and homocysteine. Initially all patients underwent computed tomography of the chest organs. Revealed what indicators of the erythroid series in the groups of patients with and without CVD had significant differences in a number of parameters: ESR; RDW-SD and RDW-CV with significant excess of parameters in group 2. Three months after discharge from the hospital, patients in both groups had a significant increase in HCT, MCV, MCH. There was detected decrease in both groups in MCHC, RDW-CV (p<0.001 for all parameters), ESR level in group 2.At baseline, CRP exceeded reference values in both groups of patients, reaching maximum values in group 2. After 3 months CRP decreased significantly only in group 1. Increased CRP was associated with elevated hs-CRP in 3 months after discharge and elevated homocysteine levels in both groups, indicating the persistence of prolonged inflammatory vascular reaction in patients after SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia, more pronounced in group 2 patients. RDW-CV over 13.6 and lymphocytes / CRP less than 0.6 increase the likelihood of having lung tissue damage over 50% by 9.3 and 5.9 times, respectively. Thus, the data obtained confirm that RDW-CV, the coefficient of variation of erythrocyte distribution width, associated with the parameters of inflammatory response and the lymphocytes / CRP is lung volume marker and of COVID-19 severity. Careful consideration of already known laboratory parameters allows us to expand the number of indicators influencing the risk of COVID-19 complications and enable an earlier response to a difficult situation.\\ntitle: Estimation of erythrocyte parameters of general blood analysis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 -associated pneumonia', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 530}), Document(page_content='abstract: PURPOSE The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of attached shadow cues for laparoscopic task performance. METHODS We developed a soft-light overhead illumination system (SOIS) that produced attached shadows on objects. We compared results using the SOIS with those using a conventional illumination system with regard to laparoscopic experience and laparoscope-to-target distances (LTDs). Forty-two medical students and 23 surgeons participated in the study. A peg transfer task (LTD, 120 mm) for students and surgeons, and a suture removal task (LTD, 30 mm) for students were performed. Illumination systems were randomly assigned to each task. Endpoints were: total number of peg transfers; percentage of peg-dropping errors; and total execution time for suture removal. After the task, participants filled out a questionnaire on their preference for a particular illumination system. RESULTS Total number of peg transfers was greater with the SOIS for both students and surgeons. Percentage of peg-dropping errors for surgeons was lower with the SOIS. Total execution time for suture removal was shorter with the SOIS. Forty-five participants (69% in total) evaluated the SOIS for easier task performance.

METHODS: We used 34 SARS‐CoV‐2 samples to perform a rapid surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT), applicable to many laboratories as it circumvents the need for biosafety level‐3 containment. We correlated results from the sVNT with five additional commonly used SARS‐CoV‐2 serology techniques: the microneutralisation test (MNT), in‐house ELISAs, commercial Euroimmun‐ and Wantai‐based ELISAs (RBD, spike and nucleoprotein; IgG, IgA and IgM), antigen‐binding avidity, and high‐throughput multiplex analyses to profile isotype, subclass and Fc effector binding potential. We correlated antibody levels with antibody‐secreting cell (ASC) and circulatory T follicular helper (cTfh) cell numbers. RESULTS: Antibody data obtained with commercial ELISAs closely reflected results using in‐house ELISAs against RBD and spike. A correlation matrix across ten measured ELISA parameters revealed positive correlations for all factors. The frequency of inhibition by rapid sVNT strongly correlated with spike‐specific IgG and IgA titres detected by both commercial and in‐house ELISAs, and MNT titres. Multiplex analyses revealed strongest correlations between IgG, IgG1, FcR and C1q specific to spike and RBD. Acute cTfh‐type 1 cell numbers correlated with spike and RBD‐specific IgG antibodies measured by ELISAs and sVNT.

The energy markets of North America, South America, and Europe are the net transmitters of spillovers, whereas the Asian and Pacific energy markets are the net receivers of spillovers. The results also reveal that the connectedness of regional energy markets is time and frequency dependent. Regional energy stocks were highly connected following the Asian financial crisis (AFC), global financial crisis (GFC), European debt crisis (EDC), shale oil revolution (SOR), and COVID-19 pandemic. Time-dependent results reveal that high spillovers formed during stress periods and frequency domain show the higher connectedness of regional energy stock markets in the short run followed by an extreme economic condition.

Cancer patients and survivors may be disproportionately affected by these changes, including decreased access to healthcare, increased infection risk, and economic challenges. We sought to determine the effects of the pandemic on thyroid cancer survivors’ quality of life. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was administered in collaboration with ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors’ Association, consisting of questions about (1) demographics, (2) thyroid cancer clinical characteristics, (3) attitudes toward and impact of COVID-19, and (4) the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29-item profile. The survey was linked on the ThyCa homepage. PROMIS measures were scored using item response theory models with a T-score metric relative to U.S. reference data via the HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.healthmeasures.net). T-scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman’s rank correlation tests. Results: From 5/6/2020 - 10/8/2020, 505 participants accessed the survey, and all completed surveys by U.S.-based thyroid cancer survivors were analyzed (n=378, 75%). Mean age was 53 years, 89% were female, 90% were white, 74% had papillary thyroid cancer, 97% had surgery, and 70% received radioactive iodine. The vast majority agreed or strongly agreed (83%) that their lives were very different during COVID-19, as was the way they interacted with their doctors (79%). Less than half (43%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the amount of information from their doctor’s office regarding COVID-19 changes. Compared to previously-published PROMIS data for this population, T-scores were significantly higher in the domain of anxiety/fear (57.8 vs. 56.5, p<0.01) and lower for ability to participate in social roles and activities (46.2 vs. 48.1, p<0.01). Younger age was weakly correlated with greater anxiety/fear (Spearman’s rho=-0.38, p<0.01), and greater anxiety/fear was associated with pending treatment (p<0.01), lower cancer stage (p=0.01), and female sex (p=0.02). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, thyroid cancer survivors reported increased anxiety/fear and decreased social participation.

We aimed to distinguish clinical data and computed tomography (CT) images between COVID-19 and other lung diseases in an advanced care hospital. METHODS: We assessed clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 between February 20 and May 21, 2020, at the University of Tokyo Hospital. RESULTS: Typical appearance for COVID-19 on CT images were found in 24 of 29 COVID-19 cases and 21 of 168 non-COVID-19 cases, according to the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement (for predicting COVID-19, sensitivity 0.828, specificity 0.875, positive predictive value 0.533, negative predictive value 0.967). When we focused on cases with typical CT images, loss of taste or smell, and close contact with COVID-19 patients were exclusive characteristics for the COVID-19 cases. Among laboratory data, high fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and low white blood cell count (P < 0.01) were good predictors for COVID-19 with typical CT images in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively low prevalence region, CT screening has high sensitivity to COVID-19 in patients with suspected symptoms. When chest CT findings are typical for COVID-19, close contact, loss of taste or smell, lower white blood cell count, and higher fibrinogen are good predictors for COVID-19.\\ntitle: Diagnostic prediction of COVID-19 based on clinical and radiological findings in a relatively low COVID-19 prevalence area', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 535}), Document(page_content='abstract: Today hundreds of people are diagnosed with COVID-19 but in this case report we are introducing an asthmatic child presenting COVID-19 symptoms who didn’t improve despite appropriate treatment for asthma, pneumonia and COVID-19 Further examinations revealed a surprising underlying disease It is Important to consider that in pandemics such as COVID-19, since all attention is paid to the disease, underlying hidden causes may be neglected This report aims to inform physicians not to be overwhelmed by current events\\ntitle: Challenges in an asthmatic child with COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 536}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: During the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, many cultural and sporting events were held without spectators or had to be cancelled. Therefore, several containment strategies to provide requirements for safe events were developed and tested. Nonetheless, every second (50.7%) is afraid of becoming infected on an event. We therefore investigated which hygiene and containment measures are perceived to be important from the visitor’s point of view and thus might increase subjective sense of safety. METHODS: This online study was carried out in November 2020. A total of 1,004 persons, who regularly attended events before the pandemic, took part in the study. The importance of different hygiene and containment measures was evaluated using a 5-point Likert-scale (1 “unimportant” to 5 “extremely important”). Potential statistical differences in socio-demographical aspects (age, gender, net disposable income for leisure activities) and attendance on events were tested with analyses of variance. RESULTS: Participants perceived the use of disinfectant (M = 4.10) as the most important element of containment strategies, followed by transparent information on the hygiene strategy (M = 4.00), reduced occupancy (M = 3.98), and optimized ventilation (M = 3.97). Body temperature measurement at the entrance (M = 3.27), a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (M = 3.11), completion of a health questionnaire (M = 3.05), and abandoning breaks and catering (M = 2.98) were considered as less important. Analyses of group differences in socio-demographical aspects found abandoning breaks and catering to be more important to men than to women. This strategy is also more important to people aged 66 and above than to younger age groups (e.g., age 20–40). For women, the use of disinfectant is considerably more important. No other significant differences exist. CONCLUSION: Combining relevant measures appears to be important to provide a safe containment strategy. Measures aimed at positively influencing people’s sense of safety do not fully correspond to researched knowledge of effectiveness. There are also target group-specific differences in the rating of measures, which should be considered while preparing containment strategies. To describe the dynamic development of changes in subjective rating of containment strategies, continuing research is needed.\\ntitle: Perceived importance of pandemic interventions for attending cultural events – findings from Germany', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 537}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The current study was done to examine the efficacy of naproxen in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.

Results A total of 6,899 throat swab samples were collected during the pre-pandemic period of 2015 to 2019, with 2,681 of them having a positive result (38.86%). There were a total of 713 samples collected in 2020, with 142 of them showing positive results (19.92%). The overall positive rate of viral isolates significantly decreased in 2020 (p < 0.001). Declines in the isolation of the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and enterovirus were observed. The RSV surprisingly became the leading isolate, with up to 47 (6.59%) instances in 2020, and showing an unusual peak in the winter of 2020. The rise began in September of 2020 and reached its plateau in November of that year. Conclusions Most respiratory viruses decreased under NPIs regarding SARS-CoV-2. However, the RSV outbreak in the winter of 2020 had shown the limitation of current NPIs. Possible explanations have been discussed in details and public preventive measures should be reinforced for RSV, particularly amongst people having young children both at home and in care centers.\\ntitle: The Epidemiological Features of Pediatric Viral Respiratory Infection During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Taiwan', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 543}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: BACKGROUND When treating a patient with a unilateral cleft lip, the goal is to try and achieve a result that is the least perceivable at conversational distance. The result should be a balanced and symmetric lip with scars that are hidden or are placed in natural anatomical lines. Several methods have been described to repair the lip. The most popular repairs at present are the rotation-advancement or its modifications and the various versions of the straight-line repair. METHODS In the author's unit, a method has evolved entitled the symmetric philtral column repair. In this method, the author attempts to achieve a philtral column that mirrors the philtral column on the normal side, producing a balanced appearing lip. This method has been used for the past 14 years in over 500 patients. RESULTS The results have been satisfying, with a lip revision rate of 6 percent. CONCLUSIONS The symmetric philtral column repair of a unilateral cleft lip is an effective and safe repair. The repair is easy to understand and produces results that minimize the stigmata of a cleft lip deformity.\\ntitle: Symmetric Philtral Column Repair for Unilateral Cleft Lip.\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 544}), Document(page_content='abstract: The discovery of potent STAT3 inhibitors has gained noteworthy impetus in the last decade. In line with this trend, considering the proven biological importance of 1,2,4-triazoles, herein, we are reporting the design, synthesis, pharmacokinetic profiles, and in vitro anticancer activity of novel C3-linked 1,2,4-triazole-N-arylamide hybrids and their in silico proposed mechanism of action via inhibition of STAT3. The 1,2,4-triazole scaffold was selected as a privilege ring system that is embedded in core structures of a variety of anticancer drugs which are either in clinical use or still under clinical trials. The designed 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesized by linking the triazole-thione moiety through amide hydrophilic linkers with diverse lipophilic fragments. In silico study to predict cytotoxicity of the new hybrids against different kinds of human cancer cell lines as well as the non-tumor cells was conducted. The multidrug-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) was found most susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of synthesized compounds and hence were selected to evaluate the in vitro anticancer activity. Four of the designed derivatives showed promising cytotoxicity effects against selected cancer cells, among which compound 12 showed the highest potency (IC50 = 3.61 µM), followed by 21 which displayed IC50 value of 3.93 µM. Also, compounds 14 and 23 revealed equipotent activity with the reference cytotoxic agent doxorubicin. To reinforce these observations, the obtained data of in vitro cytotoxicity have been validated in terms of ligand-protein interaction and new compounds were analyzed for ADMET properties to evaluate their potential to build up as good drug candidates. This study led us to identify two novel C3-linked 1,2,4-triazole-N-arylamide hybrids of interesting antiproliferative potentials as probable lead inhibitors of STAT3 with promising pharmacokinetic profiles.\\ntitle: Unravelling the anticancer potency of 1,2,4-triazole-N-arylamide hybrids through inhibition of STAT3: synthesis and in silico mechanistic studies.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 545}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a novel coronavirus resulted in a global pandemic that necessitated the implementation of social distancing measures. These public health measures may have affected the provision of care for patients with epilepsy. Social isolation may have also adversely affected well-being and quality of life due to informal and formal support networks becoming less accessible. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the lived experiences of patients with epilepsy and to see how their quality of life and healthcare has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From April 27 to May 15, 2020 we performed remote interviews with 18 participants who had virtual appointments with their healthcare providers and were enrolled in the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program registry. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, after which transcripts were analyzed and coded into relevant themes using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Three broad themes emerged throughout the interviews:1) impact of pandemic on informal and formal support systems; 2) impact of pandemic on healthcare provision; and 3) concerns about the impact of the pandemic on personal situations and society in the future. Participants reported anxiety and stress about decreased social engagement and activity cessations. Although face-to-face appointments were preferred, virtual care was well-received. Common concerns about the future included securing employment and burnout from balancing family responsibilities. Some patients also feared they would be stigmatized as society adapted to the situation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the need for additional research in anticipation of the implementation of remote medicine in the management and treatment of epilepsy. It also highlights the tenacity of those living with epilepsy during difficult periods despite social and familial pressures. Raising awareness during this time about the lives and experiences of epilepsy patients can help challenge misconceptions and stigma in the workplace and wider society.\\ntitle: Examining the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being and virtual care of patients with epilepsy', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 546}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND To date, no citation analysis has been conducted in the physical activity field, which can contribute to assess the impact of this research field and identify knowledge gaps. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the 500 most cited physical activity publications and report their bibliometric characteristics. METHODS The Web of Science database (all database indexes) was searched, and bibliometric characteristics were imported and calculated. RESULTS A total of 520 publications were ranked as the top 500. The sum of the citations was 326,258, and the average citation density was 41.0 (45.1) citations per year. Original research articles constituted the major portion of included publications (53.7%; 170,774 citations). Papers reporting relationship of physical activity with health were the most prevalent type of publication included (43.7%; 141,027 citations). Journal impact factor had a weak but significant positive correlation with citation density (r = .12; P = .006). The United States was ranked first in terms of the contributions from institutions and authors contributing to the most cited physical activity papers. CONCLUSIONS Top physical activity publications are well cited compared with other health behavior fields. Original research reporting on the associations between physical activity and health has a higher citation impact compared with other types of original research within the physical activity field.

RCTs from 2000 to 2017 and with employees (18-65 years) were selected. Then, intervention characteristics and work-related outcomes data were extracted. A total of 47 RCTs were included in the systematic review, and 19 RCTs (11 absenteeism, 7 productivity, and 5 work ability) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of workplace interventions for absenteeism was -1.56 (95% CI, -2.67 to -0.44) and -2.65 (95% CI, -4.49 to -0.81) considering only moderate quality RCTs. In contrast, only a few studies of workplace interventions for productivity and work ability were included, which was insufficient for determining the effectiveness and best design for improving these work outcomes. The workplace is an interesting environment to reduce absenteeism, and individualized and counseling interventions with <10 sessions/total were the most effective workplace intervention methodological design for reducing the absenteeism of employees.

In response, the authors conducted a quality improvement study at a level 4 epilepsy center between January 20, 2019, and May 31, 2020. Weekly average completion proportion of standardized documentation used by a team of neurologists for adult patients for the diagnosis of epilepsy, seizure classification, and frequency were analyzed. By December 15, 2019, a 94% average weekly completion proportion of standardized epilepsy care documentation was achieved that was maintained through May 31, 2020. Moreover, during the period of predominately telemedicine encounters in response to the pandemic, the completion proportion was 90%.

One of the most crucial issues in SVD is coping with the scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities in projects that require the laborious manual labeling of code by software security experts. One possible solution is to employ deep domain adaptation (DA) which has recently witnessed enormous success in transferring learning from structural labeled to unlabeled data sources. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a technique that attempts to bridge the gap between source and target data in the joint space and emerges as a building block to develop deep DA approaches with state-of-the-art performance. However, deep DA approaches using the GAN principle to close the gap are subject to the mode collapsing problem that negatively impacts the predictive performance. Our aim in this paper is to propose Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain Adaptation Network (Dual-GD-DDAN) for tackling the problem of transfer learning from labeled to unlabeled software projects in SVD to resolve the mode collapsing problem faced in previous approaches. The experimental results on real-world software projects show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.\\ntitle: Dual-Component Deep Domain Adaptation: A New Approach for Cross Project Software Vulnerability Detection', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 550}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (OGDs) among patients infected with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The references of included studies were also manually screened. Only studies involving patients with diagnostic-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with data from 8438 patients with test-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 13 countries were included. The pooled proportions of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction were 41.0% (95% CI, 28.5% to 53.9%) and 38.2% (95% CI, 24.0% to 53.6%), respectively. Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = -0.076; P=.02) and gustatory (coefficient = -0.073; P=.03) dysfunctions. There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared with self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; P=.01). No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by sex was observed. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19.

METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was undertaken in the physiotherapy outpatient department between June and October 2020. Patients utilizing telehealth services were invited to complete a purposely designed survey. Physiotherapists completed the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) and provided open-ended responses. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data was completed and thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. RESULTS: Patients reported positive experiences with telehealth, with 93% finding it easy to use and 90% satisfied with the time it took to get an appointment. Scores on the TUQ by physiotherapists were highest for usefulness with a mean (SD) score of 6.02 (1.09), while lower scores were seen for reliability with a score of 3.24 (1.48). Five broad themes were identified: 1) connecting with patients during a pandemic; 2) keeping treatment on track; 3) unprepared for the technology challenges; 4) telehealth - not quite the real thing; and 5) better resources to facilitate moving forwards.While the overall patient experience was high, physiotherapist's satisfaction with telehealth was more varied.

It is also an important immune target for the host in neutralizing the virus. Four antigenic sites A, B, C, and D that reside near the N-terminal domain have been defined in the S protein. Of these, the region encoding antigenic sites A and to a lesser extent D, herein defined as S-AD, are most critical in eliciting host neutralizing antibodies. Herein, we enzymatically amplified, cloned, and expressed the S-AD fragment from TGEV in the prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30a. Maximum protein expression was achieved at 30°C over a 5-h period post-induction. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated using recombinant S-AD (rS-AD) protein. In contrast to prior studies showing no activity with bacterially produced S protein, results indicated that polyclonal serum recognized TGEV-infected cells and reduced infection by 100%. Furthermore, the truncated rS-AD peptide was able to bind to the surface of cells from swine testes in a competitive manner and completely inhibit viral infection.\\ntitle: Bacterial expression of antigenic sites A and D in the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and evaluation of their inhibitory effects on viral infection', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 557}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND Pain management after total knee arthroplasty is essential to improve early mobilization, rehabilitation, and recovery. Continuous adductor canal (AC) block provides postoperative analgesia while preserving quadriceps strength. However, there have been inconsistencies regarding the optimal location for continuous catheter block. We compared continuous femoral triangle, proximal AC, and distal AC blocks for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty. METHODS Patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to three groups: femoral triangle, proximal AC, or distal AC. The surgeon performed periarticular local anesthetic infiltration. After surgery, an ultrasound-guided perineural catheter insertion procedure was performed. The primary endpoint was pain scores at rest in the morning on the first postoperative day. Secondary endpoints included pain scores at rest and during activity at other time points, quadriceps strength, and opioid consumption. RESULTS Ninety-five patients, 32 in the femoral triangle group, 31 in the proximal AC group, and 32 in the distal AC group, completed the study. Analysis of the primary outcome showed no significant difference in pain scores among groups. Secondary outcomes showed significantly lower pain scores at rest and during activity in the distal AC group than in the femoral triangle and proximal AC groups in the morning of the second postoperative day. Quadriceps strength and opioid consumption did not differ among groups.

Therefore, the current study is an attempt to investigate its social aspects and suggest a theoretical structural equation model to examine the associations between social media exposure, awareness, and information exchange and preventive behavior and to determine the indirect as well as direct impact of social media exposure on preventive behavior from the viewpoints of awareness and information exchange. The current empirical investigation was held in Pakistan, and the collected survey data from 500 respondents through social media tools were utilized to examine the associations between studied variables as stated in the anticipated study model. The findings of the study indicate that social media exposure has no significant and direct effect on preventive behavior. Social media exposure influences preventive behavior indirectly through awareness and information exchange. In addition, awareness and information exchange have significant and direct effects on preventive behavior. Findings are valuable for health administrators, governments, policymakers, and social scientists, specifically for individuals whose situations are like those in Pakistan.

Data on the effectiveness, challenges, and professionalism of telemedicine were collected. Our review suggests that telemedicine can be an effective mode of communication in many realms of plastic surgery, including cleft care and craniofacial deformities. However, many plastic surgeons are unfamiliar with the existing platforms, and there are no clear guidelines on the most optimal platforms. Physicians have to recognize that patients might have low digital health literacy or may not even possess digital device for telemedicine. There also needs to be an overall improvement in patient education. Given that telemedicine use will continue to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms and specific guidelines on telemedicine visits, such as undressing, chaperones, privacy matters, need to be established while maintaining a professional relationship between the patient and the physician.\\ntitle: The Doctor Will \"See\" You Now - Unmet Expectations of Telemedicine in Plastic Surgery', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 561}), Document(page_content='abstract: While there are various attempts to administer COVID-19-convalescent plasmas to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, neither appropriate approach nor clinical utility has been established We examined the presence and temporal changes of the neutralizing activity of IgG fractions from 43 COVID-19-convalescent plasmas using cell-based assays with multiple endpoints IgG fractions from 27 cases (62 8%) had significant neutralizing activity and moderately to potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell-based assays;however, no detectable neutralizing activity was found in 16 cases (37 2%) Approximately half of the patients (~ 41%), who had significant neutralizing activity, lost the neutralization activity within ~ 1 month Despite the rapid decline of neutralizing activity in plasmas, good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies were persistently seen The longer exposure of COVID-19 patients to greater amounts of SARS-CoV-2 elicits potent immune response to SARS-CoV-2, producing greater neutralization activity and SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibody amounts The dilution of highly-neutralizing plasmas with poorly-neutralizing plasmas relatively readily reduced neutralizing activity The presence of good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies does not serve as a surrogate ensuring the presence of good neutralizing activity In selecting good COVID-19-convalescent plasmas, quantification of neutralizing activity in each plasma sample before collection and use is required\\ntitle: Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 with IgG from COVID-19-convalescent plasma', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 562}), Document(page_content='abstract: The new epidemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for severe respiratory illness (i.e. COVID-19).

Given the widespread and increasing prevalence of children with NDID and the impact of family caregiving on psychological, social, and economic implications for both the child and family, understanding and supporting these families is an important public health concern. Objective: We conducted a scoping review on peer support networks to understand their implications on families. Considering increasing prevalence of NDID\\'s, understanding the implications of existing networks is critical to improve and nurture future support networks that can complement and reduce the burden on existing formal support systems. Design: A comprehensive search of multiple databases was conducted. Articles were screened by two reviewers and any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. We explored existing research on parent-to-parent peer support networks, which included networks that developed informally as well as those that involved a formal facilitator for the group interpersonal processes. There were no limits on the study design, date and setting of the articles. We included all research studies in English that included an identifier for (i) \"peer support networks,\" (ii) \"children with neurodevelopmental and intellectual disabilities\" and (iii) \"family caregiver outcomes.\" Results: We identified 36 articles. Majority of the studies were conducted in North America, and were face to face networks. They included families of children with a wide range of NDIDs. Relevant information extracted from different studies highlighted peer support network characteristics and development process, needs of family caregivers attending these networks, factors affecting caregiver participation and the impact of peer support networks on family caregivers. These networks represent a way to strengthen family caregivers, developing resilience and social interactions. Family caregivers sharing similar experiences support one another and provide critical information to each other. Although results are encouraging, future studies incorporating improved study designs are needed to better evaluate the effectiveness of peer support networks. Furthermore, studies where peer support networks develop organically while the child is supported are warranted. Conclusion: Although results obtained are encouraging, our findings support the need for further research studies of peer support networks with better designs and more detailed description of the factors involved in the development.\\ntitle: Understanding the Implications of Peer Support for Families of Children With Neurodevelopmental and Intellectual Disabilities: A Scoping Review', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 566}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries are common but can lead to devastating outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, it is thought that the burden of traumatic MSK injuries is minimized. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the epidemiological characteristics of traumatic MSK injuries during the lockdown period in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study included all patients who were admitted to the orthopedic department at a single tertiary hospital level 1 trauma center due to traumatic injuries from March 23 to June 21, 2020. RESULTS: The study included 92 patients. The majority were male (68.5%). The most common comorbidity was hypertension (30.4%). Falls were the most common mechanism of injury (47%). The most common sites to be fractured were the proximal femur (22.8%) followed by the distal tibia/fibula (14%). Skull fractures (12%), rib fractures (6.5%), and pneumothorax (6.5%) were the most common associated injuries. Age and the number of injuries were significant predictors of increased length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Major considerations for primary prevention must be taken into account during long periods of time with no direct patient interaction. Patient education is important to help avoid any burden that might be caused by otherwise preventable injuries. Further studies should be conducted to assess this phenomenon more in depth and to establish the appropriate method of educating patients on primary prevention.\\ntitle: Epidemiological characteristics of traumatic musculoskeletal injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic at a single tertiary hospital', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 567}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: BACKGROUND: In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German government and the 16 German federal states implemented a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to decelerate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus prevent a collapse of the health care system. These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.\\ntitle: Interests, Motives, and Psychological Burdens in Times of Crisis and Lockdown: Google Trends Analysis to Inform Policy Makers\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 568}), Document(page_content='abstract: Numerous evidences have highlighted the efficient role of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in multi-organ protection. In the present study, the neuroprotective role of DEX on cerebral ischemic injury and the underlining signaling mechanisms were explored. In order to simulate cerebral ischemic injury, we performed middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation in neurons. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR were used to examine expression of HDAC5, NPAS4, MDM2, and PSD-95 in hippocampus tissues of MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. MCAO mice received treatment with DEX and sh-PSD-95, followed by neurological function evaluation, behavioral test, infarct volume detection by TTC staining, and apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function approaches were conducted in OGD-treated neuron after DEX treatment. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed with the application of CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The interaction between MDM2 and PSD-95 was evaluated using Co-IP assay, followed by ubiquitination of PSD-95 detection. As per the results, HDAC5 and MDM2 were abundantly expressed, while NPAS4 and PSD-95 were poorly expressed in hippocampus tissues of MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. DEX elevated viability, and reduced LDH leakage rate and apoptosis rate of OGD-treated neurons, which was reversed following the overexpression of HDAC5. Moreover, HDAC5 augmented MDM2 expression via NPAS4 inhibition. MDM2 induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and degradation. In MCAO mice, DEX improved neurological function and behaviors and decreased infarct volume and apoptosis, which was negated as a result of PSD-95 silencing. DEX plays a neuroprotective role against cerebral ischemic injury by disrupting MDM2-induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and degradation via HDAC5 and NPAS4.\\ntitle: Neuroprotective Effects Against Cerebral Ischemic Injury Exerted by Dexmedetomidine via the HDAC5/NPAS4/MDM2/PSD-95 Axis', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 569}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: Prisons and detention centers in Ethiopia lack adequate hand washing, personal protective equipment, and quarantine areas As a result, they are vulnerable to the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic Despite its high risk for the COVID-19 pandemic, no study has been made to assess the preparedness and readiness in prison institutions and detention centers Methods: A cross-sectional study design mixed with a qualitative approach was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2020 A total of four prison institutions and 17 detention centers were included in the study A simple random sampling technique was employed to select the institutions The data were entered into the EpiData and exported to SPSS Windows version 22 for data management and analysis Descriptive statistics was employed for the quantitative section and content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data Results: Five out of 17 detention centers and three out of four prison facilities did not fulfill the standards related to human rights Almost all detention centers and prison facilities did not implement recommended activities of risk assessment and management of COVID-19 In addition, none of the prison facilities and detention centers had quick access to laboratory tests for suspected cases Neither the prison facilities nor the detention centers had a contingency plan for the COVID-19 pandemic Moreover, all staff working in prison facilities and detention centers mentioned that training regarding COVID-19 had not yet been given However, in all prisons and detention centers, preventive measures such as physical distancing, utilization of hand washing facilities, wearing masks, and keeping respiratory hygiene were not practiced\\ntitle: Preparedness and Readiness Against COVID-19 Pandemic in Prison Institutions and Detention Centers in Southwest Ethiopia', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 570}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: To present the new trends in epidemiology of road traffic injuries (RTIs) during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Suzhou.

However, thorough quantitative analyses of the pandemic's effects on energy use and emissions are still lacking. This is largely because well-known published datasets of greenhouse gas emissions are based on annual statistics that commonly become available one or more years after they are gathered. A high temporal resolution emission dataset is critical to capture the immediate effects of an event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an improved resolution might also allow policy makers to more quickly observe the effects of policies aimed at decreasing CO2 emissions, facilitating rapid adjustments. Here, based on a newly developed, near real-time global emission dataset, Carbon Monitor, we estimate China's daily energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions and use this dataset to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on CO2 emission trends. Such a near-real-time CO2 emission database based on activity data quantifies both anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. We show that the higher-resolution emission dataset can be used to assess the impact of COVID-19 (and similar future disruptions) within a reasonable range of uncertainty. This study finds that China's CO2 emissions in the first four months of 2020 decreased by 6.9% compared to the same period in 2019, with a total emission reduction of 234.5 million tons of CO2. The provinces of Jiangsu, Hubei, and Zhejiang were most severely affected by COVID-19, accounting for 19.4%, 17.0% and 12.5% of the total reduction in CO2 emissions, respectively. The reduction of CO2 emissions from Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Henan and Chongqing provinces is more than 10 Mt CO2, and the sum of the reduction from these five provinces accounts for 28.8% of the national total reductions. CO2 emissions in Yunnan Province, Gansu Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Shaanxi Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region increased slightly compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, COVID-19 has a little effect on CO2 emissions from Qinghai Province and Tibet Autonomous Region. This decrease in atmospheric pollutants is the largest decrease recorded and is consistent with the decrease in air pollutants observed by ground observation stations. This study finds that China's national economy has recovered rapidly. In April 2020, China's carbon emissions returned to the same level observed last year. This study predicts that China's full-year CO2 in 2020 will be 2% lower than in 2019. This will be the first time China has experienced a decline since 1997. China's carbon emissions have not rebound significantly, and the dynamic changes in China's CO2 indicate a rapid recovery of the Chinese economy. Regarding long-term trends, it is still unclear how much China's CO2 emissions will change at the end of this year and how fast the economy and industry will return to normal. With policy support, the economy will be stimulated as the pandemic fades. The IMF predicts that the global annual economic output will decrease sharply by -3.0% in 2020, which is worse than the financial crisis in 2008, based on the assumption that COVID-19 will fade globally in the second half of this year. Based on current emission dynamics, China's emission decline is estimated to be less than 5%, and the future trend will be affected by whether there will be another pandemic in the future. Current statistics are still not capable of comprehensively capturing the dynamics of CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and further monitoring, observation and data collection are urgently needed. © 2021, Science Press.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This exploratory cross-sectional study evaluated a non-probabilistic sample of women above 20 years old, carried out between August and September of 2020, through a snowball sampling using a Google Forms application. RESULTS: From a total of 2495 women, more than 70% have not been screened for cervical cancer (77.8% of 2244 women aged for screening), and more than 80% have not been screened for breast cancer (80.2% from 1325 women aged for mammography) during the pandemic. Also, 55.2% of the women did not undergo routine blood tests during the same period. The most frequent reasons for not performing screening and routine tests were: they were up to date; fear of contracting Covid-19; they decided to postpone it until after the end of the pandemic; they were unable to schedule the appointment at the healthcare center for whatever reason; and the healthcare center was only attending Covid-19 patients. Women with no comorbidities have performed significantly more mammograms and routine blood tests than women with comorbidities. In addition, women with comorbidities who were used to perform periodic medical follow-up have done it substantially more than women with no comorbidities during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: As observed, there was a significant decrease in women’s access to the healthcare system during this pandemic. Many participants reported that they had not attended any screening tests, and some reasons included fear of getting infected and due to the public measures of social distancing. The consequences are late diagnoses and a worse prognosis. It might impact the healthcare systems around the world in the next few years.

The restrictions on colocated meetings due to the Covid-19 pandemic have therefore created challenges for the management of building design. This study sought to develop an alternative method for design coordination in a cloud-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) environment, which reduces the need for such meetings. This was also seen as an opportunity to improve the way design coordination is currently managed in the construction industry, by changing several practices that for a long time have been assumed to be the default choice. It was found that online design coordination requires a more structured and formal approach and the definition of design tasks at a much higher level of detail or granularity than is currently common. There is consequently a need for a systematic process and supporting tools to correctly plan and effectively control the execution of a larger number of individual design tasks. A suitable method has been defined for online design coordination, which incorporates tools such as resource leveling and four-dimensional BIM that have not previously been used in this context. The method was successfully implemented in a real project, highlighting its feasibility and the ability to reduce the need for colocated meetings, while at the same time improving the design process.

By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.

The unknown mechanisms of infection used by SARS-CoV-2 and the absence of effective antiviral pharmacological therapy, diagnosis methods, and vaccines evoked scientific efforts on the COVID-19 outcome. In general, COVID-19 clinical features are a result of local and systemic inflammatory processes that are enhanced by some preexistent comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases, and biological factors, like gender and age. However, the discrepancies in COVID-19 clinical signs observed among those patients lead to investigations about the critical factors that deeply influence disease severity and death.

Our study demonstrated that gamification nudges young adults to adopt in-person counseling while subjective usability mediates the relationship, and vividness moderates the relationship between gamification and subjective usability. Our findings provide counselors fresh insights into motivating people to access counseling services.\\ntitle: A Behavioral Strategy to Nudge Young Adults to Adopt In-Person Counseling: Gamification', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 585}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: The Hawai'i Emergency Management Agency Community Care Outreach Unit (CCO) conducted a survey to gauge the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the health and social welfare of individuals and their families across the state of Hawai'i.

This article presents a descriptive analysis of the data to provide a basic overview of the impact of COVID-19 in Kaua'i County (KC), as assessed in August/September 2020. A total of 420 participants in KC responded to the statewide survey. Approximately one-third reported that they or their family members experienced reduced work hours or lost their job because of COVID-19. Many reported difficulties paying for many types of living essentials and expected these difficulties to increase in the near future. Prevalent challenges for the fall school semester included access to funds for school supplies and face-coverings. About one-third reported feeling nervous more than half the time or nearly every day in the past 2 weeks, and one-fourth reported feeling worried more than half the time or nearly every day in the past 2 weeks. The majority perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate/very high and most had at least a moderate level of knowledge about risks for contracting severe COVID-19. Less than half said they would know how to provide care for someone in their family with COVID-19. Half of the respondents in KC reported maintaining social distancing usually/all of the time, the majority reported wearing a face-covering usually/always when needed. The results provide a baseline for understanding the impact, needs, and threats to the health and social welfare of households and their families in KC as a result of COVID-19. Local stakeholders can utilize this information for developing priorities, strategies, and programs to address the pandemic where needed and also to assess progress in areas of need.\\ntitle: A Report on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Health and Social Welfare in the County of Kaua'i, Hawai'i\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 586}), Document(page_content='abstract: Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China.

Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results.

About 50% of the variance of g is due to inherited DNA differences (heritability) which increases across development. Much less is known about the genetics of the middle level of the CHC model, which includes 16 broad factors such as fluid reasoning, processing speed, and quantitative knowledge. We provide a meta-analytic review of 863,041 monozygotic-dizygotic twin comparisons from 80 publications for these middle-level factors, which we refer to as specific cognitive abilities (SCA). Twin comparisons were available for 11 of the 16 CHC domains. The average heritability across all SCA is 55%, similar to the heritability of g. However, there is substantial differential heritability and the SCA do not show the dramatic developmental increase in heritability seen for g. We also investigated SCA independent of g (g-corrected SCA, which we refer to as SCA.g). A surprising finding is that SCA.g remain substantially heritable (53% on average), even though 25% of the variance of SCA that covaries with g has been removed. Our review frames expectations for genomic research that will use polygenic scores to predict SCA and SCA.g.

In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs. Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication.

We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015-2016 to 2019-2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5-6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015-2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population.

The use of advanced therapies in the form of durable left ventricular assist device or heart transplant in this patient population remains a data free zone. We present, to our knowledge, the first case of durable LVAD implantation in a recovered COVID-19 patient. Case Report A 63-year old, previously healthy, male was admitted to OSH with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. This hospitalization was complicated by anterior STEMI, cardiomyopathy with severe LV dysfunction and cardiogenic shock. Due to widespread COVID-19 pandemic, invasive evaluation was deferred and the patient was medically managed. He was then transferred to our institution after re-admission for recurrent cardiogenic shock. Echocardiogram revealed dilated LV cavity (6.3 cm), LVEF 10% and large apical aneurysm. Chest CT showed sequelae of prior COVID-19 with changes suggestive of fibrosis. CMR which showed LV dilatation, severe LV systolic dysfunction, LVEF 7% and large apical aneurysm with evidence of thrombus. A large transmural infarct in the LAD territory without viability was confirmed. Cardiogenic shock was managed with Dobutamine and attempts to wean inotrope resulted in worsening hemodynamic and clinical profile. Axillary IABP was placed to facilitate physical and respiratory rehabilitation. The patient underwent placement of HeartMate™ 3 device as DT and LV aneurysm repair. Post-operative course was uneventful and he was ultimately discharged to acute rehabilitation in stable condition. Summary As the global case rate continues to climb and the threat of an exponential surge of long-term cardiac complications looms in the not so distant future, the use of durable MCS in recovered COVID-19 patients may evolve. This case highlights LVAD as a feasible option in end-stage HF and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in assessing candidacy for advanced HF therapies in post-COVID-19 patients. Continued international collaboration and further study regarding use of MCS will be paramount in optimizing care and outcomes in this growing patient population.\\ntitle: To VAD or Not to VAD: A Case of Durable Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation in a COVID-19 Patient', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 595}), Document(page_content='abstract: Coronavirus disease has unarguably been the largest pandemic of recent times.

The pathogenesis of myocardial damage could be direct or indirect, including inflammation, coronary spasm, plaque rupture, and cytokine storm. Thromboembolism is also an important feature of cardiovascular affliction with both arterial and venous systems being affected. Hence, anticoagulation has also been a matter of debate. Fulminant myocarditis is the most severe form and can lead to circulatory shock with a high mortality. Management of cardiac patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is not considerably different from non-COVID-19 cardiovascular disease, but interaction between cardiovascular drugs and anti-COVID-19 therapy requires careful attention. More recently, vaccines have emerged as a ray of hope for the disease. But simultaneously, there have been reports of thromboembolism following vaccination.

Using data science in digital health raises significant challenges regarding data privacy, transparency, and trustworthiness. Recent regulations enforce the need for a clear legal basis for collecting, processing, and sharing data, for example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (2016) and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act (2018). For health care providers, legal use of the electronic health record (EHR) is permitted only in clinical care cases. Any other use of the data requires thoughtful considerations of the legal context and direct patient consent. Identifiable personal and sensitive information must be sufficiently anonymized. Raw data are commonly anonymized to be used for research purposes, with risk assessment for reidentification and utility. Although health care organizations have internal policies defined for information governance, there is a significant lack of practical tools and intuitive guidance about the use of data for research and modeling. Off-the-shelf data anonymization tools are developed frequently, but privacy-related functionalities are often incomparable with regard to use in different problem domains. In addition, tools to support measuring the risk of the anonymized data with regard to reidentification against the usefulness of the data exist, but there are question marks over their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic literature mapping study, we aim to alleviate the aforementioned issues by reviewing the landscape of data anonymization for digital health care. METHODS: We used Google Scholar, Web of Science, Elsevier Scopus, and PubMed to retrieve academic studies published in English up to June 2020. Noteworthy gray literature was also used to initialize the search. We focused on review questions covering 5 bottom-up aspects: basic anonymization operations, privacy models, reidentification risk and usability metrics, off-the-shelf anonymization tools, and the lawful basis for EHR data anonymization. RESULTS: We identified 239 eligible studies, of which 60 were chosen for general background information; 16 were selected for 7 basic anonymization operations; 104 covered 72 conventional and machine learning–based privacy models; four and 19 papers included seven and 15 metrics, respectively, for measuring the reidentification risk and degree of usability; and 36 explored 20 data anonymization software tools. In addition, we also evaluated the practical feasibility of performing anonymization on EHR data with reference to their usability in medical decision-making. Furthermore, we summarized the lawful basis for delivering guidance on practical EHR data anonymization. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature mapping study indicates that anonymization of EHR data is theoretically achievable; yet, it requires more research efforts in practical implementations to balance privacy preservation and usability to ensure more reliable health care applications.\\ntitle: Data Anonymization for Pervasive Health Care: Systematic Literature Mapping Study', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 597}), Document(page_content='abstract: A review of the literature on COVID-19 pandemic in patients with thalassemias is presented.

Most cerebrovascular events described have been ischemic strokes, but both intracerebral hemorrhage and rarely cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) have also been reported. The diagnosis of CVST can be elusive, with wide-ranging and nonspecific presenting symptoms that can include headache or altered sensorium alone. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, barriers to diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of CVST in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We abstracted data on all patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 from March 1 to August 9, 2020 at Boston Medical Center. Subsequently, we reviewed the literature and extracted all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 through August 9, 2020 and included all studies with case descriptions. RESULTS: We describe the clinical features and management of CVST in 3 women with COVID-19 who developed CVST days to months after initial COVID-19 symptoms. Two patients presented with encephalopathy and without focal neurologic deficits, while one presented with visual symptoms. All patients were treated with intravenous hydration and anticoagulation. None suffered hemorrhagic complications, and all were discharged home. We identified 12 other patients with CVST in the setting of COVID-19 via literature search. There was a female predominance (54.5%), most patients presented with altered sensorium (54.5%), and there was a high mortality rate (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: During this pandemic, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CVST in patients with a recent history of COVID-19 presenting with non-specific neurological symptoms such as headache to provide expedient management and prevent complications. The limited data suggests that CVST in COVID-19 is more prevalent in females and may be associated with high mortality.\\ntitle: Cerebral Venous Sinus Thromboses in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Three Cases and a Review of the Literature', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 601}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is continuously disseminating worldwide.

Here we present novel machine learning frameworks for identifying common and rare disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants, is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness. Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE, enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals, potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function. Overall, our study characterizes a comprehensive genetic landscape of COVID-19 severity and provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of severe disease, leading to new therapeutic targets and sensitive detection of at-risk individuals.\\ntitle: Common and rare variant analyses combined with single-cell multiomics reveal cell-type-specific molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 severity', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 604}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background Morocco was affected, as were other countries, by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Methods In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, we included all adult patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to Sheikh Khalifa International University Hospital in Casablanca between March 18 and May 20, 2020. Patients were separated into two groups: Non-severe patients were those with mild or moderate forms of COVID-19, and severe patients were those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who had one of the following signs-respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; oxygen saturation < 93% on room air; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); or required mechanical ventilation. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and outcomes were reviewed. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to explore predictive factors of severity. Results We reported 134 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age was 53 years (interquartile range [IQR], 36-64), and 73 (54.5%) were men. Eighty-nine non-severe patients (66.4%) were admitted to single bedrooms, and 45 (33.6%) were placed in the ICU. The median time from illness onset to hospital admission was seven days (IQR, 3.0-7.2). Ninety-nine patients (74%) were admitted directly to the hospital, and 35 (26%) were transferred from other structures. Also, 68 patients (65.4%) were infected in clusters. Of the 134 patients, 61 (45.5%) had comorbidities, such as hypertension (n = 36; 26.9%), diabetes (n = 19; 14.2%), and coronary heart disease (n = 16; 11.9%). The most frequent symptoms were fever (n = 61; 45.5%), dry cough (n = 59; 44%), and dyspnea (n = 39; 29%). A total of 127 patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (95%). Eleven critical cases received lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%). Five patients received tocilizumab (3.7%). We reported 13 ARDS cases in ICU patients (29%), eight with acute kidney injury (17.8%), and four thromboembolic events (8.8%). Fourteen ICU patients (31.1%) died at 28 days. In univariable analysis, older men with one or more comorbidities, infection in a cluster, chest scan with the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) 5, lymphopenia, high rates of ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with severe forms of COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression model founded increasing odds of severity associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.09, P = .0039), men (OR 3.19, CI 1.06-9.60, P = .016), one or more comorbidities (OR 4.36, CI 1.32-14.45, P = .016), CRP > 10 mg/L (OR 5.47, CI 1.57-19.10, P = .008), and lymphopenia lower than 0.8 x10(9)/L (OR 6.65, CI 1.43-30.92, P = .016). Conclusions Clinicians should consider older male patients with comorbidities, lymphopenia, and a high CRP rate as factors to predict severe forms of COVID-19 earlier.

PARTICIPANTS: Frontline HCWs aged 18 years of age or older, at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (including staff of emergency departments, intensive care units, intubation teams, COVID-wards, and staff deployed to Long Term Care facilities) of five academic hospitals in downtown Toronto, Canada. Exclusion criteria include: currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study period, and/or breast feeding; known hypersensitivity/allergy to hydroxychloroquine or to 4-aminoquinoline compounds; current use of hydroxychloroquine; known prolonged QT syndrome and/or baseline resting ECG with QTc>450 ms and/or concomitant medications which simultaneously may prolong the QTc that cannot be temporarily suspended/replaced; known pre-existing retinopathy, G6PD deficiency, porphyria, liver disease including cirrhosis, encephalopathy, hepatitis or alcoholism, diabetes on oral hypoglycemics or insulin, or renal insufficiency/failure; disclosure of self-administered use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine within 12 weeks prior to study; confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 at time of enrollment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: hydroxychloroquine, 400mg (2 tablets) orally per day. Comparator: placebo, two tablets visually identical to the intervention, orally per day MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 infection). This is a composite endpoint which includes positive results from any validated SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay including detection of viral RNA, and/or seroconversion. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and then undergo monthly follow-up at day 30, 60, and 90, 120. At each visit, participants will provide an oropharyngeal sample, blood sample, and will undergo electrocardiogram monitoring of the QTc interval. Secondary outcome measures include: adverse events; symptom duration of COVID-19; days of hospitalization attributed to COVID-19; respiratory failure requiring ventilator support attributed to COVID-19; mortality attributed to COVID-19; total days off work attributed to COVID-19; seropositivity (reactive serology by day 120); and short term psychological impact of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at day 1, 60, 120 days using the K10, a validated measure of non-specific psychological distress. RANDOMISATION: Within each site, participants will be individually randomized to either the intervention arm with HCQ or the placebo arm using a fixed 1:1 allocation ratio using an interactive web-based response system to ensure concealment of allocation. Randomization schedules will be computer-generated and blocked using variable block sizes. BLINDING (MASKING): All participants, research coordinators, technicians, clinicians and investigators will be blinded to the participant allocation group. Numbers to be randomised (sample size) N=988, randomised into two groups of 494 patients. TRIAL STATUS: This summary describes protocol version No. 1.6, May 15, 2020.

While most of these strategies rely heavily on specific PCRs targeting the characteristic mutations of some lineages, several approaches using the alterations at the cycle threshold (Ct) of different commercial PCR diagnostic tests have been described. The objective of this study is to analyse the use of the Ct difference at the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay (Seegene, Korea) between the Nucleocapside (N) and the Spike (S) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes as a preliminary screening for variant tracking. METHODS: The samples analysed with the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay from 1(st) of March 2021 to 26(th) of December 2021 were selected. The Ct values for N, S, RdRP were collected, and the differences between N and S (ΔS) and N and RdRP (ΔRdRP) were calculated. Using ΔS and ΔRdRP a diagnostic test was designed and these results were compared to the routine Variant assessment. RESULTS: The mean ΔS and ΔRdRP were characteristic for Alpha and Delta. This difference was statistically significant. For Every analysed Variant the diagnostic test achieved a higher than 90% sensitivity with a noteworthy performance with the Omicron variant (97% sensitivity and 90% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the Ct alterations at the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay may be a suitable method for an early approach to SARS-CoV-2 variant assessment.\\ntitle: Use of the Ct difference between the Nucleocapside (N) and the Spike (S) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes as a preliminary screening for SARS-CoV-2 variants with the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay: Searching the N in Variants', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 607}), Document(page_content='abstract: COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV2 virus is an acute respiratory illness which was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

Zoonotic transmission events have increased in frequency in recent decades due to changes in human behavior, including increased international travel, the wildlife trade, deforestation, and the intensification of farming practices to meet demand for meat consumption. Influenza A viruses (IAV) possess a number of features which make them a pandemic threat and a major concern for human health. Their segmented genome and error-prone process of replication can lead to the emergence of novel reassortant viruses, for which the human population are immunologically naïve. In addition, the ability for IAVs to infect aquatic birds and domestic animals, as well as humans, increases the likelihood for reassortment and the subsequent emergence of novel viruses. Sporadic spillover events in the past few decades have resulted in human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, with high mortality. The application of conventional vaccine platforms used for the prevention of seasonal influenza viruses, such as inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) or live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs), in the development of vaccines for HPAI viruses is fraught with challenges. These issues are associated with manufacturing under enhanced biosafety containment, and difficulties in propagating HPAI viruses in embryonated eggs, due to their propensity for lethality in eggs. Overcoming manufacturing hurdles through the use of safer backbones, such as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAI), can also be a challenge if incompatible with master strain viruses. Non-replicating adenoviral (Ad) vectors offer a number of advantages for the development of vaccines against HPAI viruses. Their genome is stable and permits the insertion of HPAI virus antigens (Ag), which are expressed in vivo following vaccination. Therefore, their manufacture does not require enhanced biosafety facilities or procedures and is egg-independent. Importantly, Ad vaccines have an exemplary safety and immunogenicity profile in numerous human clinical trials, and can be thermostabilized for stockpiling and pandemic preparedness. This review will discuss the status of Ad-based vaccines designed to protect against avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential.\\ntitle: Adenoviral Vectors as Vaccines for Emerging Avian Influenza Viruses', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 611}), Document(page_content='abstract: This case report presents a large left rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) case developed in a COVID-19 patient who had received no anticoagulant therapy before hospital admission.

Progressive NAFLD leads to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and ultimately causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and NASH is currently a frequent cause of liver transplantation. Oxidative stress is often contributed to the progression of NAFLD, and hence, antioxidants such as silymarin, silybin, or silibinin, pentoxifylline, resveratrol, and vitamins A, C, and E are used in clinical trials against NAFLD. Silymarin induces the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a fatty acid sensor, which promotes the transcription of genes that are required for the enzymes involved in lipid oxidation in hepatocytes. Silybin inhibits sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and carbohydrate response element-binding protein to downregulate the expression of genes responsible for de novo lipogenesis by activating AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Pentoxifylline inhibits TNF-α expression and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. Thus, it prevents NAFLD to NASH progression. Resveratrol inhibits methylation at Nrf-2 promoters and NF-κB activity via SIRT1 activation in NAFLD conditions. However, clinically, resveratrol has not shown promising beneficial effects. Vitamin C is beneficial in NAFLD patients. Vitamin E is not effectively regressing hepatic fibrosis. Hence, its combination with antifibrotic agents is used as an adjuvant to produce a synergistic antifibrotic effect. However, to date, none of these antioxidants have been used as a definite therapeutic agent in NAFLD patients. Further, these antioxidants should be studied in NAFLD patients with larger populations and multiple endpoints in the future.\\ntitle: A Molecular Insight into the Role of Antioxidants in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 614}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Contact tracing during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the USA has been met with various challenges.

METHODS: Between October and November 2020, close contacts were elicited from persons under investigation (PUIs) at one COVID-19 testing site in Fulton County, GA. Secure online data collection forms were used to record PUI demographic data, close contact information and reasons for not providing contacts. RESULTS: Of 1238 PUIs, 48% reported at least one contact. Among the 66 people who tested positive, 16 (24%) reported contacts compared to 578/1165 (50%) who tested negative. PUIs of increasing age were less likely to provide contacts; Black and Hispanic PUIs were also less likely to report any contacts compared to White and Asian PUIs.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with acute stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between March 15 to May 15, 2020 to one of the six participating comprehensive stroke centers. Baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, workup, treatment and outcome are presented as total number and percentage or median and interquartile range. Outcome at discharge was determined by the modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS). Variables and outcomes were compared for males and females using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The study included 83 patients, 47% of which were Black, 28% Hispanics/Latinos, and 16% whites. Median age was 64 years. Approximately 89% had at least one preexisting vascular risk factor (VRF). The most common complications were respiratory failure (59%) and septic shock (34%).

Then, we reviewed published literature along two orthogonal directions, health certificates and exchange systems. We studied different health certificates published during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the categories of health certificates and their characteristics. Meanwhile, we further studied different design paradigms and characteristics of health certificate exchange systems. Last, we mapped our findings on health certificate exchange into the four challenges of movement management systems in a pandemic, namely flexible controllability, scalable accessibility, adaptive reusability, and spatiotemporal traceability, and conceptualized how such the requirements should be achieved and a complete system should operate. © 2021 IEEE.\\ntitle: Reopen Offline Business during a Pandemic?

This study aimed at proving a research hypothesis whereby living close to Green Infrastructure (GI) during the confinement period was beneficial for mental health. To this end, La Palma (Canary Islands) and Zaragoza (Peninsular Spain) were taken as case studies, since both locations distributed a questionnaire to address citizenry’s self-reported mental health under strict lockdown conditions. A spatial statistical analysis of the responses collected by these questionnaires revealed that variables such as stress, anger, medication use, alcohol consumption or visits to the doctor significantly decreased if citizens were close to GI, whereas people having very high expectations of enjoying the city after the confinement were positively correlated to proximity of green areas. Although these outcomes are limited by the inferential capacity of correlation analysis, they point out to a sense of relief derived from having visual contact with vegetated landscapes and feeling stimulated about using them for recreation, aesthetical or sporting purposes.

Previous studies established that osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the inner ear inhibits otic capsule remodeling. OPG acts as a decoy receptor of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) to disrupt the interaction between RANKL and RANK, the primary regulators of bone metabolism. Here we studied the expression and function of RANK and RANKL in the murine cochlea. Using a combination of in situ hybridization, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and western blot, we demonstrate that Rankl and Rank genes and their protein products are expressed in the intracochlear soft tissues and the otic capsule in a developmentally regulated manner. Using a culture of neonatal murine cochlear neurons, we show that the interaction between RANK and RANKL inhibits neurite outgrowth in these neurons, and is associated with upregulation of Nogo-A expression. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to regulating otic capsule bone remodeling, RANK and RANKL expressed by intracochlear soft tissues may also regulate spiral ganglion neuron function by affecting neurite outgrowth.\\ntitle: Postnatal Expression and Possible Function of RANK and RANKL in the Murine Inner Ear.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 622}), Document(page_content='abstract: Host species-specific fitness landscapes largely determine the outcome of host switching during pathogen emergence.

Methods: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. Results: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO2/FiO2&gt; 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO2/FiO2≤ 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04).

We developed a model that predicts reporting completeness at the country/pathogen level from input variables accessible from the literature. Methods: We performed a literature search that collected estimates of reporting completeness for 32 pathogens, representing reporting estimates from 52 countries. We combined epidemiological and social science theory to identify factors that may influence empirical reporting rates, developed a model that can be used to estimate reporting completeness. We then applied this model to estimate reporting rates for SARS-CoV-2. Findings: Pathogen- and country-specific factors were predictive of reporting rates. Country epidemic preparedness was positively associated with reporting completeness, while countries with high levels of media bias in favor of incumbent governments were less likely to report infectious disease cases. Deadlier pathogens and sexually transmitted pathogens were more likely to be reported. Our model predicts that COVID-19 cases are widely underreported, with the true number of infections ranging from approximately 2·5 to 43 times the reported cases.Interpretation: Underreporting is a complex phenomenon that is driven by pathogen-level, health system, and political factors. This model can characterize and correct for the uncertainty in reported infectious disease statistics, particularly when outbreak-specific empirical estimates of underreporting are unavailable. More precise estimates can inform control policies and improve the accuracy of infectious disease models.Funding: None reported.Declaration of Interests: No competing interests to declare.\\ntitle: Estimating Infectious Disease Underreporting at the Country Level: A Model and Application to the COVID-19 Pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 626}), Document(page_content='abstract: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the biggest threat to human being globally.

However, despite the established importance of hope, little research to date has examined its developmental origins. Specifically, a lack of appropriate instrumentation represents a significant barrier to detecting hope in children under the age of eight years old. The current study meets this need by examining the reliability and validity of a novel parent-report measure of hope in early childhood, titled the Parent Report of Child Hope (PRCH). The PRCH represents an initial step towards understanding individual differences in early childhood hope. The present study also sought to provide an understanding of the developmental influences on hope in early childhood using the PRCH. The PRCH was hypothesized to be a reliable and valid measure of hope in children younger than 8 years old. Specific Aims of the current study included, Aim 1: To provide evidence of the construct validity of the PRCH as an assessment of hope in young children, Aim 2: To provide evidence of the reliability and criterion-related validity of the Parent PRCH as an assessment of hope in young children, and Aim 3: To understand whether factors hypothesized to either contribute to or undermine hope development are predictors of hope, as well as agency and pathways thinking individually, in young children in order to provide a foundational understanding of hope development.Participants included 263 caregivers of children between the ages of 60 and 82 months. Parents completed online surveys containing the PRCH, an adapted, parent-report version of the Children's Hope Scale, and measures assessing child behaviors, social understanding, school readiness, and ego resilience. Parents also reported on the quality of their relationship with their child, their own level of depression, and the impact that COVID-19 has had on their family structure. The overall findings of the present study support the PRCH as a reliable and valid measure of hope in early childhood. The PRCH sufficiently captured individual differences in hope among young children and followed the expected two factor structure, confirming construct validity. The PRCH demonstrated good internal consistency and criterion-related validity. Child social understanding, parent-child closeness, and school readiness positively predicted PRCH scores. Parent-child conflict negatively predicted PRCH scores. Scores on the PRCH predicted ego resilience and prosocial behaviors in children. These findings are consistent with hope theory, which suggested that the developmental origins of hope could be measured in early childhood (Snyder, 2000).

An on-line screening registry allowed a daily report of ICU beds occupancy rate by flu infected patients (Flu-OR) admitted in French ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective inception cohort study with results of an on-line screening registry designed for daily assessment of ICU burden. RESULTS: Among the 108 centers participating to the French H1N1 research network on mechanical ventilation (REVA) - French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF) registry, 69 ICUs belonging to seven large geographical areas voluntarily participated in a website screening-registry. The aim was to daily assess the ICU beds occupancy rate by influenza-infected and non-infected patients for at least three weeks. Three hundred ninety-one critically ill infected patients were enrolled in the cohort, representing a subset of 35% of the whole French 2009 pandemic cohort; 73% were mechanically ventilated, 13% required extra corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22% died. The global Flu-OR in these ICUs was only 7.6%, but it exceeded a predefined 15% critical threshold in 32 ICUs for a total of 103 weeks. Flu-ORs were significantly higher in University than in non-University hospitals. The peak ICU burden was poorly predicted by observations obtained at the level of large geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: The peak Flu-OR during the pandemic significantly exceeded a 15% critical threshold in almost half of the ICUs, with an uneven distribution with time, geographical areas and between University and non-University hospitals.

The literature on the dermoscopic aspects of mucosal LP is still scarce. This study aimed to describe the dermoscopic aspects of mucosal LP and to provide a comprehensive updated summary of the literature. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in Charles Nicolle, La Rabta, and Habib Thameur hospitals from December 2019 to October 2020. We included patients with histologically confirmed mucosal LP for whom a dermoscopic examination was performed. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. The main dermoscopic structures observed were as follows: Wickham's striae (WS) (91%), vessels (88%), pigmentated structures (41%), erosions (63%), scales (34%), and blunting of lingual papillae (3.1%). WS patterns were as follows: reticular (67%), radial (48%), annular (30%), globular (15%), dotted/starry sky (15%), and veil-like blue or grey-white homogenous pattern (19%). Vascular structures were as follows: linear (85%), dotted (70%), looped (22%), and peripheral sea anemone-like vessels (37%). These vessels were distributed in a radial arrangement at the periphery of the lesions in 67% of the cases. Pigmented structures included brown/blue globules (33%), grey-blue dots (30%), and brown dots (26%). CONCLUSION Dermoscopic features of mucosal LP are varied. WS is the hallmark of LP.

To assess whether EPAC could regulate vWF release during inflammation, we utilized our EPAC1-null mouse model and revealed increased secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice in the absence of the EPAC1 gene. Pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 in vitro mimicked the EPAC1-/- phenotype. In addition, EPAC1 regulated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-triggered vWF secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a manner dependent upon inflammatory effector molecules phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Furthermore, EPAC1 activation reduced inflammation-triggered vWF release, both in vivo and in vitro.

One of the most widely used measures of mental wellbeing is the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). We conducted four studies to validate the Polish version of the WEMWBS. Their objectives are the following: (1) to present the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the WEMWBS (study 1: n = 1197); (2) to evaluate the test–retest reliability of the Polish version of the WEMWBS (study 2: n = 24); (3) to determine the validity of the WEMWBS (study 3: n = 610); (4) to examine sensitivity of the WEMWBS scale to detect population with different levels of pro-health behaviours (study 4: n = 430). METHODS: To explore the dimensional structure of the scale we tested a one-factor model. The evaluation employed explanatory and confirmatory factor analyses and tested reliability and stability. To determine the convergent validity of the WEMWBS we analysed correlations among wellbeing and life satisfaction and risk depression. To examine sensitivity of the WEMWBS scale to detect a population with different levels of health-related behaviours we used Student’s t test. RESULTS: The results presented confirm that the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of WEMWBS are very good. Using EFA and CFA it was shown that a one-factor solution is optimal. Reliability, measured using the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and McDonald's omega proved to be very high. The estimation of the stability of the Polish version of the WEMWBS proved to be high. Our validation studies also provided data demonstrating sensitivity of the WEMWBS to detect a population with different levels of health-related behaviours, indicating that group with high level of pro-health behaviours achieved higher WEMWBS wellbeing results than group with low level of pro-health behaviours.

Due to the high indicators for its psychometric properties, the scale may therefore prove to be a particularly useful tool not only in empirical research, but also in mental wellbeing monitoring, and could serve as support in educational and preventive.\\ntitle: Factor structure and psychometric properties of a Polish adaptation of the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 649}), Document(page_content='abstract: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many emergency departments (EDs) initiated continuous use of N95 disposable respirators (N95s) rather than discarding them after each use to conserve respirators. This study investigates the efficacy of wearing disposable N95s continuously during clinical work. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of ED staff required to wear N95s continuously throughout their shifts. Subjects were doctors, nurses, and technicians who were previously fitted for their assigned N95 by employee health. Subjects were fit tested periodically throughout their shifts. Investigators filled out a questionnaire for each subject noting the hours of continuous N95 wear. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen N95s were evaluated, with 23 failures at first testing. These were not retested. Twenty-seven N95s passed at the start of a shift and did not have repeat testing during the course of the shift. These were excluded from further analysis. Seventeen N95s passed testing after several hours of continuous wear, but only had a single fit test done partway or at the end of a shift. These were assumed to have passed if tested at shift start, and were assigned as \"passes\" for continuous use. Forty-six N95s had an initial pass and were evaluated for continuous use, of which 6 subsequently failed later in the shift, giving a fail rate with continuous use of 9.5%. CONCLUSION: Continuous use of disposable N95s throughout an ED shift is reasonable during a PPE shortage if wearers are assured of fit at the start of their shift.\\ntitle: The efficacy of continuous use disposable N95 masks in clinical practice in the emergency department', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 650}), Document(page_content='abstract: AIMS The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between depressive symptoms, burnout and perceptions of patient safety. A mediation model was proposed whereby the association between symptoms of depression and patient safety perceptions was mediated by burnout. BACKGROUND There is growing interest in the relationships between depressive symptoms and burnout in healthcare staff and the safety of patient care. Depressive symptoms are higher in healthcare staff than the general population and overlap conceptually with burnout. However, minimal research has investigated these variables in nurses. Given the conceptual overlap between depressive symptoms and burnout, there is also a need for an explanatory model outlining the relative contributions of these factors to patient safety. DESIGN A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed at three acute NHS Trusts. METHOD Three-hundred and twenty-three hospital nursing staff completed measures of depressive symptoms, burnout and patient safety perceptions (including measures at the level of the individual and the work area/unit) between December 2015 - February 2016. RESULTS When tested in separate analyses, depressive symptoms and burnout facets were each associated with both patient safety measures. Furthermore, the proposed mediation model was supported, with associations between depressive symptoms and patient safety perceptions fully mediated by burnout. CONCLUSION These results suggest that symptoms of depression and burnout in hospital nurses may have implications for patient safety. However, interventions to improve patient safety may be best targeted at improving burnout in particular, with burnout interventions known to be most effective when focused at both the individual and the organisational level.\\ntitle: Burnout mediates the association between depression and patient safety perceptions: a cross-sectional study in hospital nurses.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 651}), Document(page_content='abstract: Hash table is a fundamental data structure that provides efficient data store and access. It is a key component in AI applications which rely on building a model of the environment using observations and performing lookups on the model for newer observations. In this work, we develop FASTHash, a “truly” high throughput parallel hash table implementation using FPGA on-chip SRAM. Contrary to state-of-the-art hash table implementations on CPU, GPU, and FPGA, the parallelism in our design is data independent, allowing us to support p parallel queries ([Formula: see text]) per clock cycle via p processing engines (PEs) in the worst case. Our novel data organization and query flow techniques allow full utilization of abundant low latency on-chip SRAM and enable conflict free concurrent insertions. Our hash table ensures relaxed eventual consistency - inserts from a PE are visible to all PEs with some latency. We provide theoretical worst case bound on the number of erroneous queries (true negative search, duplicate inserts) due to relaxed eventual consistency. We customize our design to implement both static and dynamic hash tables on state-of-the-art FPGA devices. Our implementations are scalable to 16 PEs and support throughput as high as 5360 million operations per second with PEs running at 335 MHz for static hashing and 4480 million operations per second with PEs running at 280 MHz for dynamic hashing.

Three groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and a sample of cognitively unimpaired elders underwent an eye-tracking evaluation. All participants in the discovery sample, including controls, had a biomarker-supported diagnosis. Oculomotor correlates of neuropsychology and brain metabolism evaluated with 18F-FDG PET were explored. Machine-learning classification algorithms were trained for the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease, bvFTD and controls. A total of 93 subjects (33 Alzheimer's disease, 24 bvFTD, seven svPPA, and 29 controls) were included in the study. Alzheimer's disease was the most impaired group in all tests and displayed specific abnormalities in some visually-guided saccade parameters, as pursuit error and horizontal prosaccade latency, which are theoretically closely linked to posterior brain regions. BvFTD patients showed deficits especially in the most cognitively demanding tasks, the antisaccade and memory saccade tests, which require a fine control from frontal lobe regions. SvPPA patients performed similarly to controls in most parameters except for a lower number of correct memory saccades. Pursuit error was significantly correlated with cognitive measures of constructional praxis and executive function and metabolism in right posterior middle temporal gyrus. The classification algorithms yielded an area under the curve of 97.5% for the differentiation of Alzheimer's disease vs. controls, 96.7% for bvFTD vs. controls, and 92.5% for Alzheimer's disease vs. bvFTD. In conclusion, patients with Alzheimer's disease, bvFTD and svPPA exhibit differentiating oculomotor patterns which reflect the characteristic neuroanatomical distribution of pathology of each disease, and therefore its assessment can be useful in their diagnostic work-up.

This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and 95% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression with robust options. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically different. RESULTS: A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 ± 10.6 years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (93.7%) via television and social media (72.8% and 62.1%, respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4%) answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8%), although some misconceptions existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2%) maintained good practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10–1.41, P<0.05). Also, the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83–0.99, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe symptoms, including death from COVID-19.

METHODS Between November 2006 and November 2009, 41 patients with a mean age of 69.6 years (range 51-86) underwent 51 bicompartmental knee arthroplasties with the Journey-Deuce knee prosthesis. All patients presented with symptomatic medial and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis, with intact cruciate ligaments and a preserved lateral compartment on plain radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Clinical assessment was undertaken pre-surgery and at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-surgery using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Group 5-Dimension self-reported questionnaire (EQ-5D) and maximal active range of motion (ROM). RESULTS 30 patients (37 knees) were followed-up at a mean time of 11.4 years (SD 1.1; range 10.5-14.0). Eight patients (ten knees) were deceased and three could not be contacted at final review. No major component revision was performed. Pre-operative OKS 25.4 (SD 5.2; range 15-40), knee flexion 116.4° (SD 10.3°; range 100°-140°) and EQ-5D 70.5 (SD 19.9; range 25-95). 10-year OKS 43.5 (SD 4.1; range 32-48), knee flexion 127.3° (SD 11.1°; range 105°-144°) and EQ-5D 77.4 (SD 9.3; range 60-100). The OKS (p < 0.0001), EQ-5D (p = 0.024) and active knee flexion ROM (p < 0.0001) all significantly improved from pre-surgery to 1-year post-surgery, with no further significant changes in these scores between any post-operative time period up until 10 years. 32% (7/22) of tibial and 45% (10/22) of femoral components showed progressive radiolucencies between 2 and 5-year and 10-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest cohort of patients having undergone BCKA (with the Journey-Deuce prosthesis) with longest follow-up described in the literature. At 10 years, patients presented with significantly improved clinical outcomes, comparable to other surgical arthroplasty options. No major component revision was performed. Progressive radiolucencies were noted in 32% of tibial and 45% of femoral components without corresponding clinical signs of loosening.

Objective: To assess whether racial/ethnic disparities in very preterm birth (VPTB) and preterm birth (PTB) increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 8026 Black, Latina, and White women who gave birth during the study period. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of Black vs White disparities in VPTB or PTB in a pandemic cohort was compared with a prepandemic cohort by using electronic medical records obtained from 2 hospitals in New York City. Exposures: Women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2020, were considered the pandemic cohort, and women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2019, were considered the prepandemic cohort. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were performed using samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab at the time of admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical estimates of gestational age were used to calculate VPTB (<32 weeks) and PTB (<37 weeks). Log binomial regression was performed to estimate Black vs White risk differences, pandemic cohort vs prepandemic cohort risk difference, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Covariate-adjusted models included age, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, and parity. Results: Of 3834 women in the pandemic cohort, 492 (12.8%) self-identified as Black, 678 (17.7%) as Latina, 2012 (52.5%) as White, 408 (10.6%) as Asian, and 244 (6.4%) as other or unspecified race/ethnicity, with approximately half the women 25 to 34 years of age. The prepandemic cohort comprised 4192 women with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In the prepandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.4% (20 of 451) and PTB risk was 14.4% (65 of 451) among Black infants compared with 0.8% (17 of 2188) VPTB risk and 7.1% (156 of 2188) PTB risk among White infants. In the pandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.3% (21 of 491) and PTB risk was 13.2% (65 of 491) among Black infants compared with 0.5% (10 of 1994) VPTB risk and 7.0% (240 of 1994) PTB risk among White infants. The DID estimators indicated that no increase in Black vs White disparities were found (DID estimator for VPTB, 0.1 additional cases per 100 [95% CI, -2.5 to 2.8]; DID estimator for PTB, 1.1 fewer case per 100 [95% CI, -5.8 to 3.6]). The results were comparable in covariate-adjusted models when limiting the population to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. No change was detected in Latina vs White PTB disparities during the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of women who gave birth in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic, no evidence was found for increased racial/ethnic disparities in PTB, among women who tested positive or tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\\ntitle: Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Very Preterm Birth and Preterm Birth Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 661}), Document(page_content='abstract: Abstract Regarding to the recent work of engineering SARS-CoV-19 virus and the publication “Rapid reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic genomics platform” by researchers at University of Bern, this paper comments on the “dual-use” problem and regulation issue of synthetic biology from the perspective of responsible (research and) innovation, biosafety and biosecurity.

However, several studies have identified parenchymal changes in their placental tissues, suggesting a placental response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the maternal-fetal interface. Although many COVID-19 placental studies have focused on the expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2, further characterization of subcellular molecules involved in viral trafficking have not yet been investigated in these tissues. Of interest are Rab proteins, a family of small GTPase proteins that direct intracellular transport between different endocytic organelles. Rab5 and Rab7 in particular have previously been implicated in HIV and cytomegalovirus invasion of placental trophoblast cells in vitro; the localization of these molecules has not been fully characterized within the human maternal-fetal interface, however, or within placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnancies. METHODS: Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry, Rab5 and Rab7 placental localization and comparative fluorescence intensity were explored in a cohort of placental tissues from pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19 disease (COVID, n = 15) compared with contemporary control subjects (Control, n = 10). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by using corrected total cell fluorescence values. FINDINGS: Within placental villi, Rab5 was consistently localized in syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells. Rab5 had significantly higher mean (SEM) fluorescence intensity in the COVID cohort (Control, 1.96 [0.16]; COVID, 2.62 [0.09]; P = 0.0014). In contrast, although Rab7 was also localized within placental villous syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, mean (SEM) Rab7 fluorescence intensity was significantly downregulated in COVID vs Control placentas (Control, 35.9 [4.1]; COVID, 20.1 [0.52]; P = 0.0001). IMPLICATIONS: This differential expression of Rab5 and Rab7 suggests that placental endocytic pathways may be altered at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnancies affected by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. As key molecules governing intracellular vesicle transport, including viral trafficking, Rab GTPase proteins may be of interest for ongoing studies examining placental responses to COVID-19 in pregnancy.\\ntitle: Differential Expression of Rab5 and Rab7 Small GTPase Proteins in Placental Tissues From Pregnancies Affected by Maternal Coronavirus Disease 2019', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 670}), Document(page_content='abstract: Definitive pharmacological therapies for COVID-19 have yet to be identified.

PIDA has a high iodine payload (>84 wt%), and the aggregation of nanofibrous PIDA can further amplify CT intensity and has improved geometrical and positional stability in vivo. Moreover, with a conjugated backbone, PIDA is in deep blue color, making it dually visible by both CT imaging and the naked eyes. The performance of PIDA in CT-guided preoperative planning and visualization-guided surgery is validated using orthotopic xenograft rat models. In addition, PIDA excels clinical fiducial markers of imaging-guided radiotherapy in efficiency and biocompatibility, and exhibits successful guidance of robotic radiotherapy on Beagles, demonstrating clinical potential to translate CT diagnosis accuracy into therapeutic intervention for precision medicine.\\ntitle: Precisely translating computed tomography diagnosis accuracy into therapeutic intervention by a carbon-iodine conjugated polymer', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 674}), Document(page_content='abstract: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China rapidly became a pandemic across the world, including the US.

We reviewed 15 peripheral blood smears from 15 most recently admitted patients (Table 1). These patients range from 26 to 90 years of age and include 8 males and 7 females.

The underlying molecular mechanisms behind these clinical observations have not yet been explained. Herein, we investigated the disease-specific gene expression signatures that may induce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We studied 30 frequently occurring acute, chronic, or infectious diseases of recent times that have shown comorbidity in one or another respiratory disease(s) caused by pathogenic human infecting coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. We retrieved array-based gene expression data for each disease and control from relevant datasets. Subsequently, all the datasets were quantile normalized, and log-2 transformed data was used for analysis. Results The expression of ACE2 receptor and host proteases, namely FURIN and TMPRSS2 that are essential for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, was upregulated in all six studied subtypes of leukemia (hereafter, referred as leukemia). The expression of ACE2 was also increased in psoriasis, lung cancer, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), breast cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. The expression of FURIN was higher in psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, and in type II diabetic liver, whereas it was lowered in breast cancer. Similarly, the expression of TMPRSS2 was increased during lung cancer and type II diabetes;it was decreased during psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.Furthermore, a heightened expression of genes that are involved in immune response was observed in leukemia patients, as shown by the higher expression of IFNA2, IFNA8, IFNA10, IFNA14, IFNA16, IFNA21, IFNB1, CXCL10, and IL6. The expression of JAK1, STAT1, IL6, and CXCL10 was higher in NAFLD. Besides, JAK1 and STAT1 were upregulated in type II diabetic muscles. In addition, most of the upregulated genes in COVID-19 patients showed a similar trend in leukemia, NAFLD, and psoriasis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, were found to commonly alter two genes, namely, CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 11 and CLUSTERIN. Conclusions: The genes that may confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly upregulated in leukemia patients;hence, leukemia patients are relatively more susceptible to develop COVID-19, followed by other chronic disorders, such as, NAFLD, type II diabetes, psoriasis, and hypertension. This study identifies key genes that are altered in the studied diseases types, which may aid in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and underlie COVID-19 associated comorbidities.\\ntitle: A Meta-analysis of Comorbidities in COVID-19: Which Diseases increase the Susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Infection?', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 676}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: OBJECTIVE To examine dietary behaviors and diet quality among caregivers of children regarding the number of policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) change interventions implemented in their neighborhoods.

Methods: Data were collected from 2004 individuals through an online survey conducted 6 to 8 weeks after the first lockdown in France. Participants were asked whether they supported eight COVID-19 preventive measures. COVID-19-related perceptions were also assessed using an adapted version of Witte’s Extended Parallel Process Model, together with sociodemographic and environmental variables. Results: Acceptance rate reached 86.1 % for individual protective measures, such as make mask mandatory in public open space, and 70.0% for collective restrictions, such as isolating the most vulnerable people (80%) or forbidding public gatherings (79.3%). The least popular restrictions were closing all schools/universities and non-essential commerce such as bars and restaurants (57.2%). Acceptance of collective restrictions was positively associated with their perceived efficacy, fear, and perceived severity of COVID-19, and negatively with age older than 60 years. Acceptance of individual protective measures was associated with their perceived efficacy, fear, and perceived severity of COVID-19.

While taste perception in the laboratory has been widely studied, it has rarely been taken into account when exploring dietary patterns in a population (3). The aim of this work is to identify consumers' taste perceptions for a list of foods. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) rolling programme year 9 was used to generate a list of foods consumed by adolescents (10-19 years old). 1748 different foods were grouped by type/food group, and/or sugar/salt contents into 7 main and 23 subgroups. A pilot test identified foods with high agreement to further limit the list. The shortened food list was included in an online survey which was distributed to Facebook groups and Twitter. Food-taste classification questions asked participants to allocate one main taste to each food: sweet, salty, sour, bitter and savoury/umami;neutral and never tried. To minimize participant burden, the food list was divided into 3 and participants were asked to complete one part with an option to complete the rest. Foods were allocated to taste categories based on agreement by ≥ 50% of respondents. If there was a &lt; 50% agreement, foods were classified by allocation to two+ taste categories based on the highest scoring taste combinations The pilot questionnaire was completed by 19 participants. 15/19 rated 55 foods as the same taste and these were removed from the final questionnaire. The final food list contained 184 items. The main online questionnaire obtained 209 responses from 162 females, 44 males, (3 not known). The age range was from 18-70+ years with the majority between 40-59 years old. Seven reported having COVID-19, but only 3 were tested positive (none experienced a taste loss). Food items were classified as 29% neutral, 22% sweet, 11% savoury/umami, 9% salty, 7% bitter, and 5% sour. Six mixed tastes categories were identified: savoury/umami-salty (11%), sweet-sour (3%), sweet-bitter (2%), sour-bitter (1%), salty-bitter (0.5%) and savoury/umami-bitter (1%). In the next step of the study, taste categories will be applied to the remaining foods consumed by adolescents reported in the NDNS to generate taste patterns allowing us to explore links with nutrition and anthropometry. We have characterised major tastes for all foods consumed in the most recent NDNS. This will allow us to create a UK food-taste database and explore dietary-taste patterns in the NDNS.\\ntitle: Taste classification of foods consumed in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 680}), Document(page_content='abstract: Nordic walking is an increasingly popular form of exercise among the elderly. Using poles is thought to facilitate a more upright posture; however, previous studies primarily investigated the effects of Nordic walking on respiratory function and physical fitness. The aims of this study were to investigate the influence of Nordic walking on spinal posture, physical functions, and back pain in community-dwelling older adults. Thirty-one community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 60 years participated in a twice weekly Nordic walking training program for 12 weeks. The outcome measures, including spinal posture, physical functions, back pain, and the strength and endurance of back extensor muscles were assessed before and after a 12-week program. After training, spinal posture, back pain, and the strength and endurance of back extensor muscles did not show any statistically significant changes. Among the seven clinical tests of physical function, only the 30 s arm curl test, the 30 s chair stand test, and the single leg stance test showed significant improvements. Nordic walking has limited influence on age-related hyperkyphosis and back pain, but may be effective for physical function.

Design: With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a real-world cohort study using the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform. Setting: Patient-level electronic health record data were obtained from 24 million people registered with a general practice in England that uses TPP software. The primary care data were securely linked with data on COVID-19 infection and therapeutics, hospital admission and death within the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, covering a period where both medications were frequently prescribed in community settings. Participants: Non-hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients at high-risk of severe outcomes treated with sotrovimab or molnupiravir between December 16, 2021 and February 10, 2022. Interventions: Sotrovimab or molnupiravir administered in the community by COVID-19 Medicine Delivery Units. Main outcome measure: COVID-19 related hospitalisation or COVID-19 related death within 28 days after treatment initiation. Results: Patients treated with sotrovimab (n=3288) and molnupiravir (n=2663) were similar with respect to most baseline characteristics. The mean age of all 5951 patients was 52 (SD=16) years; 59% were female, 89% White and 87% had three or more COVID-19 vaccinations. Within 28 days after treatment initiation, 84 (1.4%) COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were observed (31 treated with sotrovimab and 53 with molnupiravir). Cox proportional hazards models stratified by area showed that after adjusting for demographics, high-risk cohort categories, vaccination status, calendar time, body mass index and other comorbidities, treatment with sotrovimab was associated with a substantially lower risk than treatment with molnupiravir (hazard ratio, HR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.88; P=0.014). Consistent results were obtained from propensity score weighted Cox models (HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.31-0.83; P=0.007) and when restricted to fully vaccinated people (HR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.90; P=0.020). No substantial effect modifications by other characteristics were detected (all P values for interaction>0.10). Conclusion: In routine care of non-hospitalised high-risk adult patients with COVID-19 in England, those who received sotrovimab were at lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes than those receiving molnupiravir.\\ntitle: Comparative effectiveness of sotrovimab and molnupiravir for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes in non-hospitalised patients: an observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 682}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic of global public health concern. We aimed to summarize the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the pandemic and explore the risk factors of disease progression. METHODS We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, searching three databases for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. We used random-effects models to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases. RESULTS Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID-19 patients were included. Hypertension (19.1%) and diabetes (9.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (78.4%), cough (58.5%), and fatigue (26.4%). Increased serum ferritin (74.2%), high C-reactive protein (73.3%), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (72.2%) were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities. Most patients had bilateral lung involvement (82.2%) and showed peripheral (66.9%) and subpleural (62.1%) distribution, with multifocal involvement (73.1%). And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement (64.3%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (60.7%), and thickened interlobular septa (55.1%). Respiratory failure was the most common complication (30.7%) and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 4.2%. Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis. Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease. Some specific laboratory indicators implied the deterioration of disease, such as leucocytosis, lymphopenia, platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer. Besides, the risk of bilateral pneumonia, consolidation, pleural effusion, and enlarged mediastinal nodes was higher in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS Most COVID-19 patients have fever and cough with lymphopenia and increased inflammatory indices, and the main CT feature is GGO involved bilateral lung. Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression.\\ntitle: Clinical characteristics, laboratory abnormalities and CT findings of COVID-19 patients and risk factors of severe disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 683}), Document(page_content='abstract: A significant correlation has been shown between the binding antibody responses against original SARS-CoV-2-S-protein all performed in one laboratory and vaccine efficacy of four approved COVID-19 vaccines.

The granulation experiment was conducted in four sequencing batch reactors (SBR), of which two were conventional SBRs (RC1, RC2) used as control, and two were photo-SBRs (R1, R2). R1 and RC1 were operated with a 40-min feeding during the reactors´ anaerobic cycle period, whereas R2 and RC2 with a 60-min feeding. All the reactors were operated in two phases with a C:N = 4:1 in Phase I and 8:1 in Phase II. In Phase I, AGS in RC1 and RC2 was formed 15 days before the AAGS development in R1 and R2. However, the AAGS generally presented better stability and higher diameter. On the other hand, AGS presented greater abundance of extracellular polymeric substances producing organisms, such as Xanthomonadacea and Rhodocyclaceae. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4+-N removal efficiencies were similar in all the four reactors of approximately 70% and 60%, respectively. In this phase, despite the good biomass structure, the reactors were not able to completely oxidize the high influent concentration of NH4+-N (100 mg.L-1) and COD (400 mg.L-1). This can be associated to the short time of the aerobic phase and low biomass content. In Phase II in all the reactors, a good increase in COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies to values above 95% and 93%, respectively, was achieved under a higher C:N ratio of 8 with lower influent concentration of NH4+-N (50 mg.L-1). The 60-min anaerobic feeding period in R2 and RC2 resulted in greater removal efficiency of nitrogen, confirming that small variation on cycle periods can affect the biomass composition; the biomass presented more compact granules and larger diameters under 60 min-feeding when compared with those obtained with 40 min-feeding in Phase I.\\ntitle: Start-up strategies to develop aerobic granular sludge and photogranules in sequential batch reactors.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 686}), Document(page_content='abstract: In the context of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic, we have developed a novel negative pressure aerosol protector for upper endoscopy (TRACEY).

Recent developments include new oral medicines to reduce cardiovascular events and death. They also include new modes to improve insulin administration to enhance adherence and subsequent patient management thereby reducing hypoglycaemia and improving long-term outcomes. In the case of insulins, this includes long-acting insulin analogues as well as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion systems, combined with sensor-augmented pump therapy and potentially hybrid closed-loops. The benefits of such systems have been endorsed by endocrine societies and governments in patients with Type 1 diabetes whose HbA1c levels are not currently being optimised. However, there are concerns with the low use of such systems across higher-income countries, exacerbated by their higher costs, despite studies suggesting their cost-effectiveness ratios are within accepted limits. This is inconsistent in higher-income countries when compared with reimbursement and funding decisions for new high-priced medicines for cancer and orphan diseases, with often limited benefits, given the burden of multiple daily insulin injections coupled with the need for constant monitoring. This situation is different among patients and governments in low- and low-middle income countries struggling to fund standard insulins and the routine monitoring of HbA1c levels.

METHODS: Extracted data on patient characteristics, acute illness severity, organ support and outcomes from the Case Mix Programme, the national clinical audit for adult critical care, for a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 (February to August 2020) are compared with a recent retrospective cohort of patients with other viral pneumonias (non-COVID-19) (2017-2019) and with other international cohorts of critical care patients with COVID-19, the latter identified from published reports. RESULTS: 10,834 patients with COVID-19 (70.1% male, median age 60 years, 32.6% non-white ethnicity, 39.4% obese, 8.2% at least one serious comorbidity) were admitted across 289 critical care units.

An emphasis is placed on the need to transition to telemedicine to reduce exposure rates. The effects of the pandemic have been especially significant in the geriatric population, which is at increased risk of hospital mortality with infection: 35% mortality for patients aged 70 to 79 years and greater than 60% mortality for patients aged 80 to 89 years (Gómez-Belda et all., 2020, Wiersinga et al., 2020). Physicians, as well as patients, have had to quickly adapt to telemedicine for outpatient services to reduce rates of transmission and infection. However, the barriers to telemedicine are also higher in the geriatric population. The lack of smart devices with cameras, microphones, internet, and the lack of ability and comfort in using these are some of the barriers in which the older population face (Hawley, et al. 2020). With confounding factors of dementia limiting instrumental activities of daily living, learning new technology can also be an additional burden to this population. This can lead to unwillingness or hesitation in participation of telehealth visits by both the patient and the caretaker. An increase in caregiver burden has also been shown secondary to the coronavirus pandemic and the increased isolation (Alexopoulos et al., 2020). Methods At the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, the needs of this population led to the development of the Hybrid model of care, which allows some patients to be present in person at the office but distanced in a separate room from the providers. In a separate room, a screen with a camera is set up so the appointment can occur as a “remote” visit. When indicated, short direct contact is made to complete a physical exam. This reduced time of close contact is important for infection control, especially when as testing prior to visits is not widespread for outpatient services. Prolonged exposure is defined as within 6 feet of contact with infected persons for at least 15 minutes (Wiersinga et al., 2020). This hybrid model allows for decreased time of contact, and therefore decreases exposure risk while removing the initial barrier of access to and difficulty navigating technology in this population. With more hybrid visits, patients may even develop more comfort and confidence in technology use for fully remote visits. We analyzed data routinely collected by the department regarding patient and provider satisfaction. We analyzed ratings on front desk interactions, provider interactions, ease of care, office net promoter score (NPS), and provider NPS. We compared the ratings from June to October of 2020, when the hybrid model was in use, to the ratings from June to October of 2019 using a paired t-test. Results None of the measures analyzed showed any statistically significant difference between the scores. Conclusions To provide care to the high-risk geriatric population, we developed this hybrid model of treatment. A key concern was the potential for patient dissatisfaction with not being able to see the provider in person. However, this was not seen on the patient satisfaction survey results. One reason could be related to increased flexibility from patients considering the pandemic, the quality of video visits, and a perception of valuing safety over in person visits. In the evaluation of this model, using the typical measure of patient and provider satisfaction, we did not see significant differences between the previous and new models of care. This is an encouraging result and argues for the increased use of this hybrid model in the future to optimize infection prevention while maintaining patient satisfaction. With the use of the hybrid model, geriatric patients can be partially exposed to use of technology first in the office and be provided with in person tutorials on video use. This can normalize the use of video visits with time and practice and therefore lead to more confidence when applying the use of technology at home. The hybrid model can also mitigate concern over continuous exposure, and therefore address the wellbeing of physicians.

In the current study, a novel Kunitz-like trypsin inhibitor, Kunitzin-AH, was isolated from the skin secretion of Amolops hainanensis. The novel peptide displayed a modest trypsin inhibitory activity with the inhibitor constant (K(i)) value of 1.18 ± 0.08 µM without inducing damage to healthy horse erythrocytes. Then, a series of shortened variants of Kunitzin-AH were designed by truncating a peptide loop and site mutation inside the loop to illustrate the structure–activity relationship of the trypsin inhibition function. Among the variants, a significant decrease was observed for the Cys-Cys loop domain, while the extension of an Arg at N-terminus (RCKAAFC) retained the inhibitory activity, indicating that the -RCK-motif is essential in forming the reactive domain for exerting the inhibitory activity. Furthermore, substitutions of Ala by hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues decreased the activity, indicating suitable steric hindrance provides convenience for the combination of trypsin. Additionally, the conformational simulation of the analogues processed with Chimera and Gromacs and further combination simulations between the peptides and trypsin conducted with HDOCK offered a potential opportunity for the natural trypsin inhibitory drug design. The truncated sequence, AH-798, may be a good replacement for the full-length peptide, and can be optimized via cyclization for further study.\\ntitle: Structure–Activity Relationship and Molecular Docking of a Kunitz-Like Trypsin Inhibitor, Kunitzin-AH, from the Skin Secretion of Amolops hainanensis', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 694}), Document(page_content='abstract: CONTEXT: The LMU University Hospital is among the largest healthcare facilities in Germany.

METHODS: Between July and September 2020 the disaster management team of LMU University Hospital conducted a mixed-method evaluation of the hospital’s pandemic management. A workshop series based on the After Action Review working group format was organized to examine the management structure, decision-making processes, documentation, and crisis preparedness response for a second COVID-19 wave. Further, the satisfaction of employees with the hospital’s COVID-19 management was examined through an anonymous survey. RESULTS: The workshop series highlighted a need for structural and operational adaptation of the COVID-19 management at LMU University Hospital. The results of the employee survey (N = 2182) provided positive feedback for the measures taken during the first pandemic wave. Specific actions were derived concerning the availability of personal protective equipment and emergency childcare services. A key outcome of both evaluation activities was the identified need for further improvement in communication between stakeholders.

Ocrelizumab has been shown to reduce the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, but the T-cell response to vaccination has not been fully characterized. We sought to provide data regarding B and T-cell mediated responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in ocrelizumab-treated patients, and to determine what variables correlate with vaccine immunogenicity. We hypothesized that patients without a humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination would still have intact T-cell responses. METHODS: : We conducted a prospective, observational, single center cohort study of patients with MS treated with either ocrelizumab or natalizumab as a comparator between March 2, 2021, and July 1, 2021. Eligible patients were age 18 to 55 and had no known prior infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Patients with prior use of immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents, or treatment with any anti-CD20 therapy other than ocrelizumab within 12 months of enrollment, were excluded. The Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay was performed prior to and 3-4 weeks post vaccination to evaluate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG. The Adaptive Biotechnologies T-Detect COVID Test was performed to evaluate the adaptive T-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in OCR-treated patients with no detectable antibodies. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum. RESULTS: : Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study, 69% treated with ocrelizumab and 31% treated with natalizumab. Eighteen percent of ocrelizumab and 100% of natalizumab patients had a positive antibody response. In ocrelizumab-treated patients, there was no correlation between age, sex, BMI, total number of infusions, immunoglobulin G, CD19, or absolute lymphocyte count and antibody response. There was a trend suggesting that a longer interval between the last infusion and vaccination increased the likelihood of producing antibodies (P=0.062). All ocrelizumab patients with negative antibody responses had positive T-cell responses. CONCLUSIONS: : Treatment with ocrelizumab substantially impaired the humoral response to SAR-CoV-2 vaccination but did not impair T-cell responses. Further research is needed to determine if the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is sufficient to prevent infection or reduce severity of COVID in patients who did not produce antibodies.\\ntitle: Humoral and T-Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated with Ocrelizumab\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 696}), Document(page_content='abstract: INTRODUCTION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the German health system has faced major challenges since spring 2020. In addition to restrictions in the inpatient health care sector, the maintenance of outpatient care by health care providers has also been affected by the pandemic-related restrictions. Both a decline in treatment frequencies and temporary practice closures have been observed. The aim of the study was to survey the work and care situation in outpatient physiotherapy practices during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous online survey including quantitative and qualitative items was conducted among physiotherapists in the outpatient sector in Germany between June 1 and August 31, 2020. The survey is part of the mixed-methods study “ArTheCo”, which was conducted throughout Germany including outpatient therapists and patients in physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. RESULTS: In total, 577 physiotherapists from all over Germany took part in the survey. During the first wave of the pandemic, the occupancy rate fell below 50% at 45% of the facilities. 15% of the facilities had to close temporarily. Short-time work was announced at 58% of the respondents’ practices. This and the implementation of hygiene measures restricted the provision of physiotherapy. This mainly affected patients with a higher risk of a severe clinical course of disease, such as nursing home patients. Due to complex changes in practice organisation and patient care, many of the interviewees felt that their economic existence was threatened and also described a large physical and psychological burden. Existing dissatisfaction seemed to have increased by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: To maintain continuous physical therapy, a reorganisation of the reimbursement system as well as easily accessible, consistent and feasible action plans for practices are needed. In combination with threats to existence due to the pandemic and increasing skill shortage, the outpatient physiotherapeutic care also appears to be threatened beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The current pandemic has highlighted long-standing challenges causing dissatisfaction and making the profession increasingly unattractive for some of the respondents. Political action to support physiotherapists needs to be initiated. This study indicates potential starting points.\\ntitle: Einfluss der COVID-19 Pandemie auf die ambulante Physiotherapie', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 697}), Document(page_content='abstract: This article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement on the arts and cultural sector in the United States, placing the 2020 crises in the context of the United States’s historically decentralized approach to supporting the arts and culture.

In this conceptual paper, we aim to review and adapt our existing understanding of rural adversity. We undertook a wide-ranging review of the literature, sought insights from multiple disciplines and critically developed our findings with an expert disciplinary group from across Australia. We propose that rural adversity be understood using a rural ecosystem lens to develop greater clarity around the dimensions and experiences of adversity, and to help identify the opportunities for interventions. We put forward a dynamic conceptual model of the impact of rural adversity on mental health and wellbeing, and close with a discussion of the implications for policy and practice.

Information on changes in the status of species, size of populations, and extent and condition of habitats is patchy, with little data available for many of the taxa, regions and habitats of greatest importance to the delivery of ecosystem services. However, what we do know strongly suggests that, while exceptions exist, the changes currently underway are for the most part negative, anthropogenic in origin, ominously large and accelerating. The impacts of these changes on human society are idiosyncratic and patchily understood, but for the most part also appear to be negative and substantial. Forecasting future changes is limited by our poor understanding of the cascading impacts of change within communities, of threshold effects, of interactions between the drivers of change, and of linkages between the state of nature and human well-being. In assessing future science needs, we not only see a strong role for ecological data and theory, but also believe that much closer collaboration with social and earth system scientists is essential if ecology is to have a strong bearing on policy makers.\\ntitle: Trends in the state of nature and their implications for human well-being.\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 701}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE: Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the global outbreak of \"2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV\" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.

In recent years, despite the use of China’s current vaccine immunization strategy, multiple types of PEDV strains were still found in immunized swine herds. Our research aims to explore a new rapid differentiation method to distinguish the different types of PEDV strains and assess the safety evaluation of classical attenuated vaccine strains in swine herds. RESULTS: In the study, a differential one-step quantitative real-time fluorescent reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (real-time RT-RPA) method based on the PEDV universal real-time RT-RPA assay was established according to the ORF1 deletion sequences of three classical attenuated vaccine strains (PEDV attenuated vaccine KC189944, attenuated CV777 and DR13) and five Vero cell-adapted isolates (JS2008, SDM, SQ2014, SC1402, HLJBY), which could effectively differentiate PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strains from wild-type strains (PEDV classical wild strains and variant strains). The detection limits of PEDV RNA in the both PEDV real-time RT-RPA assays were 300 copies within 20 min at 39 °C, and the detection limits of classical attenuated vaccine strain CV777, Vero-cell-adapted isolate JS2008, and PEDV wild-type strain DX were 10(0.5) TCID(50)/100 μL, 10(1.1) TCID(50)/100 μL, and 10(1.2) TCID(50)/100 μL, respectively. Both assays were highly specific for PEDV, showing no cross-reactivity with other enteral viruses.

In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics.

L8-BO with the branched alkyl chains on the beta position of the thiophene unit has previously shown improved structural order and charge transport compared to those of Y6. It was found that the molecular packing of SMA-HD featuring 2-hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY-HD is similar to L8-BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high-order molecular assembly in SMA-HD molecules.

Os documentos apresentam diferenças quanto ao formato e o conteúdo das recomendações, porém a construção discursiva de todos os guias é normativa e reproduz uma perspectiva fundamentalmente biomédica centrada nos nutrientes e na responsabilização individual, sem considerar com profundidade a multidimensionalidade do ato alimentar e as especificidades dos contextos micro e macrossociais. Revela-se também a necessidade da inclusão das dimensões interseccionais de gênero, raça, etnia e classe nas recomendações propostas.Alternate abstract:In response to the health, social, economic and political impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have adopted social isolation as a preventive measure. The concern with “healthy” eating was accentuated in this context and food norms were developed as an orientation strategy related to eating habits. The scope of this article is to carry out a critical and comparative analysis of four food guidelines published in Brazil and Spain in this period, based on three principles: concepts regarding healthy eating;the place attributed to the multidimensionality of the act of eating;and the relevance of intersectionality. Comparison of the documents was conducted using a qualitative approach based on discourse analysis. The documents feature differences in terms of the format and content of the recommendations, but the discursive construction of all the guidelines is normative and reproduces a fundamentally biomedical perspective centered on nutrients and on individual responsibility, without taking into consideration the multidimensionality of the act of eating and the specificities of the micro- and macrosocial contexts. The analysis also reveals the need to include the intersectional dimensions of gender, race, ethnicity and class into the proposed recommendations.\\ntitle: Normativizando o comer: análise crítica de guias alimentares brasileiros e espanhóis no contexto da pandemia de COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 715}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: OBJECTIVES: : Since 25th March 2020 India went into a complete and extended lockdown. Alcohol production, sales, and purchase were barred with this overnight prohibition order. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the media reports published within the first month of the nationwide lockdown with the objectives (a) using the media reports as indications of possible public health impact and population response of a sudden alcohol prohibition in India, (b) suggesting areas for future research. METHODS: : We performed thematic and content analysis of 350 articles published online in national newspapers between the 26th March, 2020 and 25th April, 2020. Initial inductive, followed by deductive coding was done in this exploratory thematic analysis. Results: The thematic analysis revealed four main themes: the beneficial aspects of the policy, the harmful aspects of the policy, non-compliance and attempts to change and / or subvert the policy, popularity and level of public buy-in of the policy. We generated relevant sub-themes under main themes. Two additional themes, not directly related to the sudden prohibition, were use of stigmatizing language and ethical concerns. The content analysis showed the frequency of the appearance of the main themes and proportions of sub-themes and codes under those main themes. CONCLUSION: : The harms, perceived from the media reports, should be balanced against the potential benefits. Absence of a national-level alcohol policy was made apparent by the reflexive, disconnected , and conflictual measures. Future research could systematically examine the potential ramifications of alcohol prohibition on public health, social, and economic aspects.\\ntitle: Extended lockdown and India's alcohol policy: a qualitative analysis of newspaper articles\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 716}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is taking many lives every day. It affects literally all aspects of life and changes humanity communication tools, mobility, lifestyle, and feasibly their level of perceived stress and depression. The present study aims to investigate the psychological health status in terms of perceived stress and depression among the UAE population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study in the UAE during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Validated assessment tools (PHQ-9 and PSS) were used to assess depression and perceived stress, respectively. Data were analyzed using categorical data and mean± SD for scores of perceived stress, and depression scales were calculated. The SPSS statistical software (version 24.0) was used for data analysis purposes. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the pandemic has significantly influenced the daily routine and psychological health. Depressive symptoms were prevalent in 47.8% of the participants. A concerned percent of participants around 84% were anxious. Age, gender, school attendance, and the impact of the pandemic on work performance were the major factors of developing depression and perceived stress symptoms. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a considerable negative psychological impact on the public in the UAE. The importance of the current study also came from the fact that only very few or no study has holistically evaluated the psychological state of the public during the lockdown in the UAE. The figures that reflect the depression and the perceived stress level among the public during the lockdown also struck our attention. Almost half of the participants in this study suffered from depression. Also, approximately 85% of the same were anxious during the lockdown. These figures should not be overlooked when further psychological assessment studies are conducted.\\ntitle: A look behind the scenes: COVID-19 impact on depression and perceived stress of UAE population', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 717}), Document(page_content='abstract: The simulation of stable distributions was performed to study an ideal movement pattern for the spread of a virus using an autonomous carrier.

Methods: Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high fat diet comprising of standard laboratory rat chow 84.3%, lard 5%, egg yolk powder 10%, cholesterol 0.2% and bile salt 0.5% for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the animals were kept in an overnight fast and injected with low dose of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.w). Results: Theaflavin (100 mg/kg b.w /day) was administered orally to diabetic rats for 30 days. At the end of the experimental period, diabetic control rats showed significant increase in plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with concomitant decrease in plasma insulin, total hemoglobin and body weight. The activities of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes, glycogen content and glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase were also altered in diabetic rats. Discussion: Oral administration of theaflavin to diabetic rats significantly ameliorated all the biochemical alterations to near normal levels. The results of the present study suggest that theaflavin exhibits antidiabetic effect through its antioxidant activity.\\ntitle: Antioxidant potential of theaflavin ameliorates the activities of key enzymes of glucose metabolism in high fat diet and streptozotocin – induced diabetic rats', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 719}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Poor sleep is associated with an increased risk of infections and all-cause mortality, and acute sleep loss and disruption have been linked with inflammation and poorer immune control. Previous studies, however, have been unable to evidence causality between the chronic effects of poor sleep and respiratory infection risk. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks, understanding the risk factors for these infections is of great importance. AIM: Our goal was to understand if chronic poor sleep could be identified as a causal risk factor for respiratory infections including influenza, upper respiratory infections and COVID-19. METHODS: We used population cohorts from the UK Biobank (N ≈ 231,000) and FinnGen (N ≈ 327,000) with ICD-10 based electronic health records and obtained diagnoses of insomnia, influenza and upper respiratory infections (URIs) from primary care and hospital settings. We computed logistic regression to assess association between poor sleep and infections, disease free survival hazard ratios, and used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of insomnia, influenza, URI and COVID-19 to perform Mendelian randomization analyses and assess causality. FINDINGS: Utilizing 23 years of registry data and follow-up, we saw that insomnia diagnosis associated with increased risk for infections in FinnGen and in UK Biobank (FinnGen influenza HR = 5.32 [4.09, 6.92], P = 1.02×10(−35), UK Biobank influenza HR = 1.54 [1.37, 1.73], P = 2.49×10(−13)). Mendelian randomization indicated that insomnia causally predisposed to influenza (OR = 1.59, P = 6.23×10(−4)), upper respiratory infections (OR = 1.71, P = 7.60×10(−13)), COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.08, P = 0.037) and risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR = 1.47, P = 4.96×10(−5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that chronic poor sleep is a causal risk factor for contracting respiratory infections, and in addition contributes to the severity of respiratory infections. These findings highlight the role of sleep in maintaining sufficient immune response against pathogens as suggested by earlier work. As the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of people suffering from poor sleep, safe interventions such as sleep management and treating individuals with insomnia could be promoted to reduce infections and save lives.\\ntitle: The public health impact of poor sleep on severe COVID-19, influenza and upper respiratory infections', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 720}), Document(page_content='abstract: There are many young people who experience mental health and wellbeing challenges. A potential negative mental health trigger for some youth is a struggle to cope with stress at school, feelings of depression and anxiety and availability of adequate help for these stressors. In response to youth needs a mental health and wellbeing Chatbot has been co-developed with youth, technology partners and expert stakeholders. An element of the Chatbot is powered by artificial intelligence and rules based AI using natural language processing. It is created to communicate evidence based resources, wellbeing support, educational mental health information and adaptive coping strategies. This paper will discuss how the Chatbot has been developed, highlighting its participatory, co-design process with youth who are the key stakeholders to benefit from this digital tool. Research from interviews and surveys informed the creation of the Chabots personality and its character design. Examples of the conversation design and content development are provided.

This high mortality rate leads many providers to feel that the treatment of pTBI is futile. Contrary to this point of view, several studies have shown that victims of pTBI who present with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &#8805;6 have a reasonable chance of a meaningful outcome. This study sought to investigate outcomes of pTBI patients based on GCS score who underwent neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy or craniectomy) and compare them with patients who did not undergo surgical intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study represents a secondary analysis of the data that were collected from 2006 to 2016 from 17 institutions as part of a multi-center study, investigating clinical outcomes for adult patients sustaining pTBI and surviving >72 h. Patients were divided into those with GCS 3-5 and those with GCS &#8805;6. Within these groups, patients were stratified by whether they received surgical intervention, compared with standard non-surgical care. Patient level data (age and gender), clinical data (Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score), GCS on admission, post-op infection rates, and outcomes data (mortality, length of stay [LOS], intensive care unit LOS) were collected. Both groups were compared using independent sample t-test or chi-squared test. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty patients with pTBI were identified over 11 y, out of which 336 (46.7%) underwent surgery. The mean Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score on admission were higher in the surgical intervention group than their non-surgical counterpart in patients with a GCS &#8805;6 (P < 0.0001). Patients with GCS of 3-5 with surgical intervention demonstrated a higher survival rate than non-surgical patients (P < 0.0001). In the GCS &#8805;6 group, surgical intervention did not impact near-term mortality. Intensive care unit LOS was significantly longer in the surgical intervention group in patients with GCS &#8805; 6 (P < 0.0001) and GCS of 3-5 (P < 0.0001), as was total hospital LOS (P < 0.0001). Patients with a GCS 3-5 and &#8805;6 who underwent surgical intervention were more likely to develop a central nervous system infection (P = 0.016; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention in pTBI patients with GCS 3-5 results in improved mortality but comes at a cost of increased resource utilization in the form of longer LOS and higher infection rate. On the other hand, in patients with GCS &#8805;6, surgery does not provide significant benefits in patient survival. Future prospective studies providing insight as to the impact of surgery on the resource utilization and quality of survival would be beneficial in determining the need for surgical intervention in this population.\\ntitle: Management of Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury: Operative versus Non-Operative Intervention', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 722}), Document(page_content='abstract: Purpose: To describe how a referral center for cardiac electrophysiology (EP) rapidly changed to comply with the ongoing COVID-19 healthcare emergency. Methods: We present retrospective data about the modification of daily activities at our EP unit, following the pandemic outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Italy. In particular, in the context of a pre-existing \"hub-and-spoke\" network, we describe how procedure types and volumes have changed in the last 3 months. Results: Since our institution was selected as a COVID-19 referral center, the entire in-hospital activity was reorganized to assist more than 1000 COVID-positive cases. Only urgent EP procedures, including ventricular tachycardia ablation and extraction of infected devices, were both maintained and optimized to meet the needs of external hospitals. In addition, most of the non-urgent EP procedures were postponed. Finally, following prompt internal reorganization, both outpatient clinics and on-call services underwent significant modification, by integrating telemedicine support whenever applicable. Conclusion: We presented the fast reorganization of an EP referral center during the ongoing COVID-19 healthcare emergency. Our hub-and-spoke model may be useful for other centers, aiming at a cost-effective management of resources in the context of a global crisis.\\ntitle: The COVID-19 challenge to cardiac electrophysiologists: optimizing resources at a referral center', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 723}), Document(page_content='abstract: In December 2019, the world became aware of an epidemic of a very severe infection caused by a new coronavirus Later, WHO declared a pandemic The pediatricians were ready for the worst The novel infection was expected to promptly spread among the most vulnerable population, children But the clinicians soon understood that the situation is unbelievable: adults develop severe disease and die, while the children remain almost excluded from the infection spreading 9 months have passed in the “new reality” The humankind was learning to respond to the new infection challenge by empirical search for the potential therapeutic and diagnostic solutions and conducting wide clinical studies in parallel A few questions have been answered because of consolidated and/or isolated actions of researchers and clinicians at the national, regional, and international levels However, most aspects of how the new coronavirus affects the humans, including children, is still unclear and our knowledge of these aspects cannot be transferred in the routine practice This review presents latest understanding of the course of the novel coronavirus infection in children, its treatment and outcomes В декабре 2019 г началась эпидемия тяжелой инфекции, вызванной новым представителем семейства коронавирусов, позже объявленная Всемирной организацией здравоохранения пандемией Педиатры приготовились к самому худшему - быстрому распространению новой коронавирусной инфекции (КВИ) среди самых уязвимых - детей, однако вскоре осознали, что впервые столкнулись с невероятной ситуацией, когда тяжело заболевали и умирали люди взрослые, а дети оставались практически вне распространения инфекционного процесса В течение 9 мес жизни в новой реальности человечество училось реагировать на новый инфекционный вызов в процессе его развития, чаще эмпирически нащупывая возможные лечебные или диагностические интервенции и параллельно широким фронтом осуществляя клинические исследования В результате иногда разрозненных, иногда консолидированных действий ученых и клиницистов на страновом, региональном и международном уровнях на некоторые вопросы уже получены ответы, однако большая часть информации, касающейся воздействия нового коронавируса на организм человека, в т ч ребенка, пока еще недоступна для внедрения в рутинную практику В данном обзоре представлены современные представления о течении, лечении и исходах новой КВИ у детей\\ntitle: COVID-19 and children', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 724}), Document(page_content='abstract: IMPORTANCE: In-hospital cardiac arrest survival among coronavirus disease 2019 patients has been reported to range from 0% to 12%.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest survival of coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 subsequently found to have in-hospital cardiac arrest and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). SETTING: Multiple hospitals of the Cleveland Clinic Health System. PATIENTS: All adult patients (age ≥ 18 yr) admitted to Cleveland Clinic Health System with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From March 01, 2020 to October 15, 2020, 3,555 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were hospitalized; 1,372 were admitted to the ICU; 58 patients had in-hospital cardiac arrest. Median age of this cohort was 66.5 years (interquartile range, 55.0–76.0 yr). Patients were predominantly male (62.5%), White (53.4%), with a median body mass index of 29.7 (interquartile range, 25.8–34.6). Most in-hospital cardiac arrests were in critical care environments (ICU), 51 of 58 (87.9%); seven of 58 (12.1%) were on ward locations. Thirty-four of 58 patients (58.6%) were on mechanical ventilation prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest with a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 9 days (interquartile range, 2–18 d). Twenty-four of 58 patients (44%) were on vasopressors prior to arrest. Initial arrest rhythm was pulseless electrical activity at (63.8%), asystole (29.3%), and pulseless ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (6.9%). Of the 58 patients, 35 (60.3%) attained return of spontaneous circulation, and 13 of 58 (22.4%) were discharged alive.

SARS-CoV2 evades the innate immune system resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) which causes AT2 cell damage. Krebs von den Lungen (KL-6) is a specific biomarker of AT2 cell damage. KL-6 is produced in AT2 cells that are injured/regenerated.

METHODS: This study was an analytical study with a prospective design on 75 COVID-19 patients who were treated. Subjects were divided into two large groups according to their degree of severity, 57 subjects with severe degrees and 18 subjects with non-severe degrees. The serum KL-6 levels were measured on days 0 and 6. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test for data were normally distributed and Wilcoxon test and Mann Whitney test for data that were not normally distributed. RESULT: In this study, the mean serum KL-6 for day 0 in the severe group was higher than the non-severe group with values of 45.70 U/mL and 44.85 U/mL. On day 6, the mean serum KL-6 in the severe group was lower than that in the non-severe group with values of 41.3 U/mL and 41.95 U/mL.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinicians’ views of the ReSPECT process was unknown. We examined whether there were changes in clinicians’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes regarding ReSPECT during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of clinicians at one acute hospital in the UK. We developed a questionnaire with a defined 5-point Likert scale and asked clinicians to recall their pre-pandemic views on ReSPECT and report their current views at the time of survey distribution (May 2020, end of the first COVID-19 wave in the UK). We compared their self-reported views before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: We analysed 171 questionnaire responses. Clinicians reported ReSPECT telephone discussions with relatives were more challenging (pre-pandemic median 4, IQR 3-4; during pandemic median 4, IQR 4-5; p <0.001) and negative emotions whilst conducting these discussions with relatives increased during the pandemic (pre-pandemic median 3, IQR 2-3.5; during pandemic median 3, IQR 2-4; p < 0.001). Clinicians also reported an increase in the importance of reaching a shared understanding of decisions with patients and relatives (pre-pandemic median 4, IQR 4-5; during pandemic median 5, IQR 4-5; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There were differences in clinicians’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes scores before and during the pandemic. Our findings highlighted that clinicians could benefit from training in remote ReSPECT conversations with relatives.\\ntitle: Comparison of clinicians’ perceptions of the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 729}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVES: Serologic assay performance studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-\\u200b2) in pediatric populations are lacking, and few seroprevalence studies have routinely incorporated orthogonal testing to improve accuracy. METHODS: Remnant serum samples for routine bloodwork from 2,338 pediatric patients at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh were assessed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (EuroIGG) assay. Reactive cases with sufficient volume were also tested using 3 additional commercial assays. RESULTS: Eighty-five specimens were reactive according to the EuroIGG, yielding 3.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-4.48%) seropositivity, of which 73 specimens had sufficient remaining volume for confirmation by orthogonal testing. Overall, 19.18% (95% CI, 10.18%-28.18%) of samples were positive on a second and/or third orthogonal assay. This 80.82% false positivity rate is disproportionate to the expected false positivity rate of 50% given our pediatric population prevalence and assay performance. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric populations, false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology may be more common than assay and prevalence parameters would predict, and further studies are needed to establish the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology in children.\\ntitle: Unexpected False-Positive Rates in Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 Serology Using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG Assay', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 730}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: BACKGROUND: Though the socio-emotional significance of psychiatric diagnoses and the frequency of transitions between diagnostic classifications are widely acknowledged, minimal research reveals how “diagnostic shifts” are subjectively experienced by psychiatric service-users. AIM: This study investigated how adult service-users make sense of diagnostic shifts and their impacts on one's life. METHODS: Twenty-seven people with self-reported experiences of diagnostic shifts opted into this qualitative study. Virtual narrative interviews invited participants to share their “diagnosis stories.” Interview transcripts were analyzed using narrative thematic analysis to identify common and divergent experiences across participants. RESULTS: Diverse experiences of diagnostic shifts were related: diagnostic shifts could both promote and undermine clinical trust, therapeutic engagement and self-understanding. The analysis suggested that shared and divergent experiences could be attributed to two dimensions of narratives: participants' Interpretations of Diagnostic Shifts and Diagnosis-Specific Factors. Regarding the former, analysis produced a typology of three possible interpretations of diagnostic shifts, which were linked with consistently different antecedents, experiences and consequences. The latter dimension captured how experiences of diagnostic shifts also hinged on the unique meanings ascribed to the specific diagnoses gained and lost, particularly in relation to their perceived severity, stigma, personal associations, and related communities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed how diagnostic shifts can be experienced as both traumatic and life-enhancing, depending on their social and subjective context. Understanding the range and predictors of variable experiences of diagnostic shifts is vital for sensitive clinical practice and communication.\\ntitle: How Does It Feel to Have One's Psychiatric Diagnosis Altered?

More importantly, we also collected clinical data for verification to make the analysis results more reliable. METHODS: Download the serum proteomics and metabolomics data of COVID-19 patients and describe their changes in serum proteins and metabolites, and use bioinformatics analysis methods to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Finally, clinical data and experimental data of cell infection were combined for verification. RESULTS: It was found that the serum apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) protein level in COVID-19 patients was down-regulated (log2FC = −0.39, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001), and the degree of reduction in the severe group was more significant (kruskal-test p = 2.5e-05). What is more, APOA1 was not only expressed lower in male patients (Wilcox-test p = 0.012), but also negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP, r = −0.37, p = 0.019). The experiment data from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells further showed that the protein and transcript level of APOA1 gradually decreased as the infection time increased, and the transcription level (log(2)FC = −8.3, FDR = 0.0015) was more down-regulated than protein level (log2FC = −0.95, FDR = 0.0014). More importantly, the collected clinical data also confirmed that APOA1 was down-regulated in COVID-19 patients (kruskal-test p = 0.001), and APOA1 levels are negatively correlated with IL6 (r = −0.396, p = 2.22e-07), D-dimers (DD, r = −0.262, p = 8.19e-04), prothrombin time (PT, r = −0.464, p = 6.68e-10) and thrombin time (TT, r = −0.279, p = 3.46e-04). CONCLUSION: The degree of down-regulation of APOA1 is positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and the expression level of APOA1 is negatively correlated with CRP, IL6, DD, PT, TT, and positively correlated with HD and LDL.

HF admissions declined compared with both control periods by 29-38%. Cardiac resynchronization therapy was implanted in 0.55% during the study period, 0.32% [odds ratio (OR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-4.04, P = 0.27] in the previous year and 0.43% (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64-2.84, P = 0.43) in the same year control.

Incorporation of fluorogenic probe or DNA intercalating dyes (such as SYBR Green) into the PCR mixture allowed real-time reaction monitoring and extraction of quantitative information (qPCR). Probes with different excitation spectra enable multiplex qPCR of several DNA segments using multi-channel optical detection systems. Here we show multiplex qPCR using an economical EvaGreen-based system with single optical channel detection. Previously reported non quantitative multiplex real-time PCR techniques based on intercalating dyes were conducted once the PCR is completed by performing melting curve analysis (MCA). The technique presented in this paper is both qualitative and quantitative as it provides information about the presence of multiple DNA strands as well as the number of starting copies in the tested sample. Besides important internal control, multiplex qPCR also allows detecting concentrations of more than one DNA strand within the same sample. Detection of the avian influenza virus H7N9 by PCR is a well established method. Multiplex qPCR greatly enhances its specificity as it is capable of distinguishing both haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes as well as their ratio.\\ntitle: Single Fluorescence Channel-based Multiplex Detection of Avian Influenza Virus by Quantitative PCR with Intercalating Dye', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 735}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: In this prospective study, nasal swab samples from patients with acute respiratory infections were evaluated for the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Patients A total of 31 patients, ranging from 24 to 83 years of age, with a mean age of 61 years (22 men, 9 women) with head and neck cancer (26 patients), malignant glomus tumor (1 patient) or giant carotid aneurysms (4 patients) as possible candidates for surgical carotid artery sacrifice were evaluated from September 2005 to September 2012. Methods All patients underwent unilateral internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion with SPECT analysis (20 mCi technetium 99m-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime [HMPAO]) imaging before and during carotid occlusion. Carotid angiography with carotid cross-compression (manual compression of the cervical artery contralateral to the side of contrast injection) was used to analyze filling through the anterior communicating artery to the contralateral hemisphere. Intervention The balloon occlusion was terminated in two patients because of deterioration of the neurologic exam. Main Outcome Measures All patients who passed the neurologic examination during BTO and also passed the SPECT occlusive study underwent successful carotid sacrifice without neurologic sequelae. Patients failing the occlusive neurologic examination and/or the SPECT study elected chemoradiation, with the exception of one patient who underwent a successful carotid bypass graft and carotid resection. Results The success of carotid sacrifice in patients passing both the occlusive test and the SPECT analysis for carotid sacrifice was 100%. Three patients failed both the BTO and the SPECT, with two demonstrating no anterior circulation cross-fill, but one showed some cross-fill.

Hence, we conducted a review of symptoms and pathophysiology associated with post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) condition in children and adolescents. We reviewed the scientific literature for reports on persistent COVID-19 symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in both children/adolescents and adults from 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2022 (based on their originality and relevance to the broad scope of this review, 26 reports were included, 8 focused on adults and 18 on children/adolescents). Persistent sequelae of COVID-19 are less common in children/adolescents than in adults, possibly owing to a lower frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to the lower impact of the infection itself in this age group. However, cumulative evidence has shown prolonged COVID-19 to be a clinical entity, with few pathophysiological associations at present. The most common post-COVID-19 symptoms in children/adolescents are fatigue, lack of concentration, and muscle pain.

As several recent reports have described the onset of thyroid dysfunction in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we performed a systematic review to assess the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 as this information could be clinically relevant for the management of these patients. Methods: A comprehensive computer literature search using PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases was performed until November 14, 2020 to search original articles evaluating thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Information about thyroid dysfunction assessed by thyroid function test was retrieved by the eligible articles. Qualitative analysis (systematic review) only was performed whether a significant heterogeneity of data was detected. Results: Seven studies including 1237 patients with COVID-19 were included. A significant heterogeneity across the studies was found. Most COVID-19 patients were euthyroid with TSH levels in the normal range (from 44 to 94% of the COVID-19 patients assessed in the included studies). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients (defined as abnormal thyroid function tests) largely varies among the included studies between 13 and 64% of COVID-19 patients as well as clinical presentation. A positive correlation between thyroid dysfunction and clinical severity of COVID-19 was reported. Conclusion: Literature data show that thyroid dysfunction is present in a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19. Assessment of thyroid function may be considered in symptomatic COVID-19 patients to have a baseline before introducing thyroid-interfering drugs and those requiring high-intensity care.

Most recently, studies on confirmed COVID-19 cases have suggested that mortality might be due to virally induced hyperinflammation. Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating &#945;-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia.

Separately, 3 T images were aggregated from open-source databases spanning four neuropathologies: low-grade glioma (LGG, N = 76), high-grade glioma (HGG, N = 259), stroke (N = 28), and multiple sclerosis (MS, N = 20). The transformation method was then applied to the open-source data to generate simulated low-field images for each pathology. Convolutional neural networks (DenseNet-121) were trained to detect pathology in axial slices from either 3 T or simulated 64 mT images, and their relative performance was compared to characterize the potential diagnostic capabilities of low-field imaging. Algorithm performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

However, nonstandard conditions necessitate the use of subjective correction factors or preclude the use of Henssge's nomogram altogether. To address this, we developed a powerful method for early PMI reconstruction using skin thermometry in conjunction with a comprehensive thermodynamic finite-difference model, which we validated using deceased human bodies.

Transfusions early during disease course was found to be beneficial. Lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could inform early responses to future pandemics and may continue to be relevant in lower resource settings. We sought to identify factors correlating to high antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors and understand the magnitude and pharmacokinetic time course of both transfused antibody titers and the endogenous antibody titers in transfused recipients. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected up to 174 days after convalescence from 93 CCP donors with mild disease, and from 16 COVID-19 patients before and after transfusion. Using ELISA, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, S1, and N-protein antibodies, as well as capacity of antibodies to block ACE2 from binding to RBD was measured in an in vitro assay. As an estimate for viral load, viral RNA and N-protein plasma levels were assessed in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking capacity were highest within the first 60 days after symptom resolution and markedly decreased after 120 days. Highest antibody titers were found in CCP donors that experienced fever. Effect of transfused CCP was detectable in COVID-19 patients who received high-titer CCP and had not seroconverted at the time of transfusion. Decrease in viral RNA was seen in two of these patients. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high titer CCP should be collected within 60 days after recovery from donors with past fever. The much lower titers conferred by transfused antibodies compared to endogenous production in the patient underscore the importance of providing CCP prior to endogenous seroconversion.\\ntitle: Use of Outpatient-Derived COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19 Patients Before Seroconversion', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 755}), Document(page_content='abstract: IntroductionThe psychological stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has a complex multifactorial nature.ObjectivesThe aim: to evaluate the level of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian-speaking population with(-out) affective disorders in different cities of residence.MethodsThe data obtained from an online survey of 4803 Russian-speaking respondents (age over 18) from March 30 to May 18, 2020.

However the occurrence of MUC1 cleavage, which leads to the release of the extracellular α subunit into the circulation where it can sequester many anti-MUC1 antibodies, renders the target problematic to some degree. To address this issue, we generated a set of unique MUC1 monoclonal antibodies that target a region termed the SEA domain that remains tethered to the cell surface after MUC1 cleavage. In breast cancer cell populations, these antibodies bound the cancer cells with high picomolar affinity. Starting with a partially humanized antibody, DMB5F3, we created a recombinant chimeric antibody that bound a panel of MUC1+ cancer cells with higher affinities relative to cetuximab (anti-EGFR1) or tratuzumab (anti-erbB2) control antibodies. DMB5F3 internalization from the cell surface occurred in an efficient temperature-dependent manner. Linkage to toxin rendered these DMB5F3 antibodies to be cytotoxic against MUC1+ cancer cells at low picomolar concentrations. Our findings show that high-affinity antibodies to cell-bound MUC1 SEA domain exert specific cytotoxicity against cancer cells, and they point to the SEA domain as a potential immunogen to generate MUC1 vaccines.\\ntitle: Antibody targeting of cell-bound MUC1 SEA domain kills tumor cells.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 757}), Document(page_content='abstract: The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 has caused great number of cases and deaths, but our understanding about the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear. The attachment of the virus with the cell-surface receptor and a co-factor is the firstly important step for the infection. Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 at the interface are identical to those as bound to the MERS-CoV spike. Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with that of SARS-CoV-S, which does not interact with DPP4.

The established literature, focusing on household responses, has found an increase in emergency calls for service when cities implement shelter-in-place orders.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study. 336 nurses who worked in inpatient wards with COVID-19 patients were randomly selected and studied. NASA-TLX Workload Questionnaire, WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire and Multidimensional Social Support Perception Scale were used to data collection. Structural equation modelling in PLS software was used to modelling. RESULTS: The results showed that the average score of workload, perceived social support and quality of life were 80.87±20.17, 56.23±11.46 and 55.87±13.74, respectively. A significant inverse relationship was observed between workload and quality of life (Pâ\\x80\\x8a<â\\x80\\x8a0.05).

These include two mutations in the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, HV69-70del and Y144del (also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions). We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, characterized by Membrane (M) protein mutations, including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the US that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021.

In the present study, a comprehensive review was made by sourcing the National Library of Medicine resources to provide updated data on epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of feline leishmaniosis. Cats were found infected with Leishmania parasites worldwide, and feline leishmaniosis appears as an emergent disease mostly reported in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and in Brazil. Cats with impaired immunocompetence seem to have a higher risk to develop clinical disease. The main clinical and clinicopathological findings are dermatological lesions and hypergammaglobulinemia, respectively. Diagnosis of feline leishmaniosis remains a challenge for veterinarians, in part due to the lack of diagnosis support systems. For this reason, a diagnostic algorithm for clinical decision support is herein proposed. No evidence-based treatment protocols are currently available, and these remain empirically based.

The conditions of some patients can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Current studies suggest that an outbreak of inflammatory response known as cytokine storm may play a key role in the process. This study was performed to investigate the relativity of the production of circulating microparticles (cMPs) and the expression of inflammatory factors (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8 and IL-10) expression in the blood on the degree of COVID-19. Methods A total of 89 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were divided into four groups, namely, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill groups, according to China's COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program (6th trial version), and 30 healthy persons were selected as the control group. The groups were compared in terms of cMP production and IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels in their blood, and the correlation between cMP production and the expression of inflammatory factors with the degree of COVID-19 were analysed. Results Differences in cMP production and IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 expression levels among the five groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cMP production or the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and the degree of COVID-19 (cMP, r=0.981;IL-6, r=0.954;IL-8, r=0.863;IL-10, r=0.895;P<0.05). Conclusion Increased levels of cMP, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 aggravate COVID-19. cMP production and the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 may predict the degree of COVID-19 to a certain extent.

Effective inflammatory responses integrate molecular and cellular functions to prevent further tissue damage, initiate repair, and restore homeostasis, while futile or dysfunctional responses allow escalating injury, delay recovery, and may hasten death(2). Elevation of white blood cell count (WBC) and altered levels of other acute phase reactants are cardinal signs of inflammation, but the dynamics of these changes and their resolution are not established(3,4). Patient responses appear to vary dramatically with no clearly defined signs of good prognosis, leaving physicians reliant on qualitative interpretations of laboratory trends(4,5). We retrospectively, observationally studied the human acute inflammatory response to trauma, ischemia, and infection by tracking the longitudinal dynamics of cellular and serum markers in hospitalized patients. Unexpectedly, we identified a conserved pattern of recovery defined by co-regulation of WBC and platelet (PLT) populations. Across all inflammatory conditions studied, recovering patients followed a consistent WBC-PLT trajectory shape that is well-approximated by exponential WBC decay and delayed linear PLT growth. This recovery trajectory shape may represent a fundamental archetype of human physiologic response at the cellular population scale, and provides a generic approach for identifying high-risk patients: 32x relative risk of adverse outcomes for cardiac surgery patients, 9x relative risk of death for COVID-19, and 5x relative risk of death for myocardial infarction.\\ntitle: White Blood Cell and Platelet Dynamics Define Human Inflammatory Recovery', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 765}), Document(page_content='abstract: To combat the COVID-19 pandemic strict contact restrictions have been imposed on institutions for both older and younger people, social structures have been locked down, families have been urged to reduce contact with older relatives, and people over 65 have been temporarily banned from their workplaces and from attending events, both in public and private spaces. These measures are assumed to have a number of psychosocial consequences. For this questionnaire study, 268 pupils (7-to-10 years-old) of nine different schools in Hamburg, Germany, with different social index were asked about how they experienced, perceived, and behaved during the COVID-19 pandemic. 75% of the children reported on restricted contact to their grandparents: While 41% did not meet their grandparents at least for a certain time at the beginning of the pandemic, 34% did not meet their grandparents during the whole first year of the pandemic.

METHODS A randomized controlled noninferiority trial was performed at a single academic institution. Women undergoing planned cesarean delivery who desired sterilization were randomized to salpingectomy or standard tubal ligation. The primary outcome was length of time of the sterilization procedure, with the noninferiority margin set at 5 minutes. With a one-sided independent sample t test, to achieve a power of 90% with an α of 0.05, 18 women needed to complete each intervention. RESULTS Forty-four women were enrolled, with 19 successfully undergoing salpingectomy and 18 undergoing standard tubal ligation. Salpingectomy could not be completed in 1 of 20 patients (as a result of adhesions). Baseline demographics were equivalent between groups. Salpingectomy procedure time was noninferior to standard tubal ligation, with a mean difference of 0.5 minutes, with a mean sterilization procedure time of 5.6 minutes in the salpingectomy group and 6.1 minutes in the standard tubal ligation group (P <.05, one-sided 95% CI upper bound 1.8 minutes). There was no difference between cesarean delivery with salpingectomy compared with cesarean delivery with standard tubal ligation in median total operating time (60 vs 68 minutes, P=.34) or estimated blood loss (600 vs 700 mL, P=.09). No patients in either group required reoperation or readmission. CONCLUSION Salpingectomy procedure time was not longer than standard tubal ligation during cesarean delivery, with a mean difference of 30 seconds.

However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperatures or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know if life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we wanted to know if the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism on adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affects adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not.

In municipalities with p.d. <200 inhabitants/km2, standardized SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate was lower than the expected, both in men (SIR=0.85, 95%CI=0.81;0.90, p<0.0001) and women (SIR=0.84, 95%CI=0.80;0.88, p<0.0001). Stratified analysis by months with likelihood ratio test showed heterogeneity of the p.d. effect in men and women (p<0.05). SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate seemed to be higher in most densely populated areas, both in men and women. Our results confirmed the great importance of restrictive measures as well as the importance of limiting the epidemic wave in the initial stages and could help guide pandemic management strategies according to urban context and population density.\\ntitle: Densità di popolazione e SARS-CoV-2: uno studio epidemiologico di urban health', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 778}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic telemedicine was rapidly expanded and incorporated into day-to-day practice by primary care providers to allow continued access to care for patients during this time. The quick adoption of telemedicine occurred out of necessity for social distancing, and evidence-based approaches are needed to determine the future utility of this approach to delivering care. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with both provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This survey-based study was conducted in 2020. Surveys were distributed electronically by e-mail to providers and patients. Participants: Surveys related to satisfaction levels with telemedicine were distributed to 73 primary care providers and 6,626 patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measures of this study were satisfaction level with telemedicine in primary care. Results: Studies were completed by 23 primary care providers and 1,692 patients. Most patient participants were female (70.8%), white (89.7%), non-Hispanic or non-Latino (96.6%), and Massachusetts residents (96.9%). Variables that were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits included: travel time saved >30 min (odds ratio [OR] 1.8), having an easy visit connection (OR = 3.2), use of Zoom© video visit over telephone only (OR = 2.8), and identifying as female (OR 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting. Providers felt that telemedicine visits usually take the same amount or less time than in-person visits. Both providers and patients reported a desire to see telemedicine visits continued after the pandemic. Patients who saved more than 30 min of travel time found it easy to connect or those who were female were more likely to be satisfied with telemedicine visits, while those that had telephone visits were less likely to be satisfied than those that had Zoom© visits.\\ntitle: Telemedicine in Primary Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Provider and Patient Satisfaction Examined.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 779}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background: COVID-19 cases in children are gradually increasing with limited information Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children with mild dis\\ntitle: Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Children with Mild COVID-19 and Clinical Significance of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 780}), Document(page_content='abstract: The global COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous stress on healthcare systems and hospital staffing However, through all this, families will continue to become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed Unfortunately, care of the childbearing family has been de-prioritized during the pandemic Additionally, many healthcare practices during the pandemic have not been positive for the childbearing family or breastfeeding Despite recommendations from the World Health Organization to promote early, direct breastfeeding and skin to skin contact, these and other recommendations are not being followed in the clinical setting For example, some mothers have been forced to go through labor and birth alone in some institutions whilst some hospitals have limited or no parental visitation to infants in the NICU Furthermore, hospitals are discharging mothers and their newborns early, limiting the amount of time that families receive expert lactation care, education, and technical assistance In addition, some hospitals have furloughed staff or transferred them to COVID-19 wards, further negatively impacting direct care for families and their newborns We are concerned that these massive changes in the care of childbearing families will be permanently adopted Instead, we must use the pandemic to underscore the importance of human milk and breastfeeding as lifesaving medical interventions We challenge healthcare professionals to change the current prenatal and post-birth practice paradigms to protect lactation physiology and to ensure that all families in need receive equal access to evidence-based lactation education, care and technical assistance\\ntitle: Promoting and Protecting Human Milk and Breastfeeding in a COVID-19 World', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 781}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: The article is an autoethnographic account written by three Italian academic researchers and mothers with children of different ages.

With RDV clinical trials on COVID-19 patients showing a reduced hospitalisation time. During the spread of the virus, the RdRp has developed several mutations, with the most frequent being A97V and P323L. The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (−24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (−17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.\\ntitle: Remdesivir MD Simulations Suggest a More Favourable Binding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase Mutant P323L Than Wild-Type', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 783}), Document(page_content='abstract: Abstract In a previous report, we showed that proteolytic processing of an 87-kDa mature viral protein from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins was mediated by two putative overlapping papain-like proteinase domains (PLPDs) encoded within the region from nucleotides 4243 to 5553 of ORF 1a (Liuet al.,1995). In this study, we demonstrate that only the first domain, PLPD-1, is responsible for this cleavage, as deletion of the second domain did not affect the formation of the 87-kDa protein. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further showed that a previously predicted nucleophilic cysteine residue (Cys1274) and a histidine residue (His1437) were essential for the proteinase activity, indicating that they may be important components of the catalytic center of the proteinase. Meanwhile, expression of a series of deletion mutants revealed that the 87-kDa protein was encoded by the 5′-most 2.6 kb of ORF 1a. Deletion and amino acid substitution mutation studies demonstrated that the Gly673–Gly674dipeptide bond was most likely the cleavage site responsible for releasing the C-terminus of the 87-kDa protein from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins.\\ntitle: Characterization of the Two Overlapping Papain-like Proteinase Domains Encoded in Gene 1 of the Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus and Determination of the C-Terminal Cleavage Site of an 87-kDa Protein', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 784}), Document(page_content='abstract: Purpose Beyond intravenous thrombolysis, evidence is lacking on acute treatment of minor stroke caused by large artery occlusion. To identify candidates for additional endovascular therapy, we aimed to determine the frequency of non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration in patients with intravenous thrombolysis-treated minor stroke caused by occlusion of large proximal and distal cerebral arteries. Secondary aims were to establish risk factors for non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration and report three-month outcomes in patients with and without non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration. Method We analysed data from the SITS International Stroke Thrombolysis Register on 2553 patients with intravenous thrombolysis-treated minor stroke (NIH Stroke Scale scores 0-5) and available arterial occlusion data. Non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration was defined as an increase in NIH Stroke Scale score ≥4 at 24 h, without parenchymal hematoma on follow-up imaging within 22-36 h. Findings The highest frequency of non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration was seen in 30% of patients with terminal internal carotid artery or tandem occlusions (internal carotid artery + middle cerebral artery) (adjusted odds ratio: 10.3 (95% CI 4.3-24.9), p < 0.001) and 17% in extracranial carotid occlusions (adjusted odds ratio 4.3 (2.5-7.7), p < 0.001) versus 3.1% in those with no occlusion. Proximal middle cerebral artery-M1 occlusions had non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration in 9% (adjusted odds ratio 2.1 (0.97-4.4), p = 0.06). Among patients with any occlusion and non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration, 77% were dead or dependent at three months. Conclusions Patients with minor stroke caused by internal carotid artery occlusion, with or without tandem middle cerebral artery involvement, are at high risk of disabling deterioration, despite intravenous thrombolysis treatment. Acute vessel imaging contributes usefully even in minor stroke to identify and consider endovascular treatment, or intensive monitoring at a comprehensive stroke centre, for patients at high risk of neurological deterioration.\\ntitle: Minor stroke due to large artery occlusion.

It typically presents with isolated psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depressed mood) at first and neurological abnormalities (e.g. seizures, movement disorders) only develop later. Thus, there is a high risk of overlooking NMDAR-E in patients with preexisting psychiatric illness due to symptom overlap in the prodromal period of the disease when treatment is most effective. Although rare, concomitant or sequential development of a demyelinating disorder is increasingly recognized as an associated disease entity (overlap syndrome), with immediate diagnostic and therapeutic implications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient with a borderline personality disorder (BPD), which developed NMDAR-E and an overlapping demyelinating disorder with anti-Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) -IgG positivity. The initial clinical presentation with predominantly affective symptoms (e.g. mood lability, anxiety, depressed mood) lead us to suspect an exacerbation of the BPD at first. However, acute changes in premorbid behavior, newly developed psychotic symptoms and memory deficits lead us to the correct diagnosis of an AE, which was further complicated by the development of a demyelinating disorder. As a result of impaired illness awareness and psychosis, diagnostic and treatment was difficult to carry out. The symptoms completely remitted after treatment with methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 5 days and 5 cycles of plasma exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous awareness for neuropsychiatric clinical warning signs in patients with a pre-diagnosed psychiatric disorder is important for a timely diagnosis. Therefore, we believe that the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm provided here, for the first time specifically addressing patients with preexisting psychiatric illness and integrating overlap syndromes, can be a useful tool. Moreover, in order to timely perform diagnostics and treatment, judicial approval should be obtained rapidly.\\ntitle: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and overlapping demyelinating disorder in a 20-year old female with borderline personality disorder: proposal of a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for autoimmune encephalitis in psychiatric patients “case report”', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 786}), Document(page_content='abstract: The respiratory protection equipment (RPE) used by health professionals consists of an essential device to prevent infectious diseases, especially those caused by biological agents such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

The aim of this work is to present a low-cost alternative as an FFP2-like filter for a reusable respirator face mask. This study presents the comparison of different cellulose-based filtering materials performed by retention testing, time saturation testing, aerosol penetration testing, nanoparticle (~140 nm) filtration testing, bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), analysis of material morphology and usability. The reusable respirator face mask used in this study is an open-source innovation, using 3D printing. Cotton disc proved to be the best filter material for the reusable mask, with satisfactory results and a performance similar to that shown by the N95-type mask. The cotton disc ensured effectiveness over 6 h of use, and after that, the reusable respirator face mask (here, Delfi-TRON®) needed to be sanitized and replenished with a new cotton disc.

However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center, retrospective study. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared. RESULTS: Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00-5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/mL [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/mL [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/mL [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/mL [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.

Saliva droplets or aerosols expelled by heavy breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing may carry this virus. People in close distance may be exposed directly or indirectly to these droplets, especially those droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces and people may end up contracting COVID-19 after touching the mucosa tissue on their faces. It is of great interest to quickly and effectively detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an environment, but the existing methods only work in laboratory settings, to the best of our knowledge. However, it may be possible to detect the presence of saliva in the environment and proceed with prevention measures. However, detecting saliva itself has not been documented in the literature. On the other hand, many sensors that detect different organic components in saliva to monitor a person's health and diagnose different diseases that range from diabetes to dental health have been proposed and they may be used to detect the presence of saliva. This paper surveys sensors that detect organic and inorganic components of human saliva. Humidity sensors are also considered in the detection of saliva because a large portion of saliva is water. Moreover, sensors that detect infectious viruses are also included as they may also be embedded into saliva sensors for a confirmation of the virus' presence. A classification of sensors by their working principle and the substance they detect is presented. This comparison lists their specifications, sample size, and sensitivity. Indications of which sensors are portable and suitable for field application are presented.

However, intravenously infused cells may be blocked in the lung, increasing the risk of vascular obstruction, which needs to be optimized to further improve safety and efficacy. METHODS: We derived small UCMSCs (S-UCMSCs) from filtering UCMSCs with a 10-μm filter, and compared with UCMSCs by flow cytometry, directional differentiation culture and transcriptome sequencing. Then the S-UCMSCs and UCMSCs were intravenously infused in the Royal College Surgeons (RCS) rats to evaluate the safety and the efficacy. RESULTS: The diameter of S-UCMSCs ranged from 5.568 to 17.231 μm, with an average diameter of 8.636 ± 2.256 μm, which was significantly smaller than that of UCMSCs. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and transcriptome sequencing demonstrated that the S-UCMSCs and UCMSCs were the same kind of MSCs, and the S-UCMSCs were more proliferative. After the S-UCMSCs and UCMSCs were intravenously infused into the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats at a dose of 1 × 10(6) cells/rat, the S-UCMSCs blocked in the lungs were significantly fewer and disappeared more quickly than UCMSCs. The b wave of the flash electroretinogram was improved at 7 d, and the retinal outer nuclear layer thickness was thicker at 7 d and 14 d. The expression level of inflammation was inhibited, and the expression level of neurotrophic factors was upregulated in the retina and serum after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: S-UCMSCs intravenous infusion was safer than UCMSCs and could delay retinal degeneration and protect visual function in RCS rats, which may be a preferable therapeutic approach for RP.

METHODS: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. RESULTS: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001), but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults.

METHODS: A large group of Italian urologists directly involved in the reorganization of their urological wards during the first and second phase of the pandemic agreed on a set of updated recommendations for current urology practice. RESULTS: The updated recommendations included strategies for the prioritization of both surgical and outpatient activities, implementation of perioperative pathways for patients scheduled for elective surgery, management of urological conditions in infected patients. Future scenarios with possible implementation of telehealth and reshaping of clinical practice following the effects of vaccination are also discussed.

Details about the structure and number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered/vaccinated individuals from the contact layer are simultaneously transferred to the information layer. The ever-growing wealth of information that is becoming available about the COVID virus was modelled at each individual level by a simplified proxy predictor of the amount of disease spread. Each informed individual, a node in a heterogeneous graph, makes a decision about vaccination \"motivated\" by their benefit. The obtained results showed that disease information type, global or local, has a significant impact on an individual vaccination decision. A number of different scenarios were investigated. The scenarios showed that in the case of the stronger impact of globally broadcasted disease information, individuals tend to vaccinate in larger numbers at the same time when the infection has already spread within the population. If individuals make vaccination decisions based on locally available information, the vaccination rate is uniformly spread during infection outbreak duration. Prioritising elderly population vaccination leads to an increased number of infected cases and a higher reduction in mortality. The developed model accuracy allows the precise targeting of vaccination order depending on the individuals\\' number of social contacts. Precisely targeted vaccination, combined with pre-existing immunity, and public health measures can limit the infection to isolated hotspots inside the population, as well as significantly delay and lower the infection peak.\\ntitle: Modelling Voluntary General Population Vaccination Strategies during COVID-19 Outbreak: Influence of Disease Prevalence', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 796}), Document(page_content='abstract: At present, the world is facing an unprecedented employment challenge due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered. METHODS: Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as “cough,” “acute bronchitis,” and “acute viral respiratory infection.” RESULTS: Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period. CONCLUSION: Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.\\ntitle: Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 800}), Document(page_content='abstract: This study investigates the changes of short-lived climate pollutants and other air pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran, Iran. Concentrations of air pollutants were obtained from 21 monitoring stations for the period from 5 January 2019 to 5 August 2019, representing normal conditions unaffected by COVID-19, and the period 5 January 2020 to 5 August 2020, i.e., during the COVID-19 crisis. We concentrated our analysis on three time windows (23 February 2020 to 15 March 2020, 18 March 2020 to 3 April 2020, and 5 April 2020 to 17 April 2020) during the lockdown when different sets of measures were taken to limit the spread of COVID-19. In comparison to the period not affected by COVID-19 measures, mean concentrations of pollutants were increased during the first lockdown period; when the number of COVID-19 patients increased sharply compared to the other periods, the mean surface concentrations of NO(2), SO(2), and CO were decreased and concentrations of other pollutants (i.e., O(3), PM(10), and PM(2.5)) were increased during the second lockdown period compared to the corresponding period in 2019. In the third period, the mean concentrations were decreased compared to the corresponding period in 2019. For the full period, decreases in mean concentrations of O(3), NO(2), SO(2), CO, and PM(10) and increases in PM(2.5) were observed during the COVID-19 crisis, compared to 2019. Overall, the strongest reductions, 12% and 6%, respectively, were observed for CO and NO(2), pointing to reduced emissions from traffic as a result of lockdown measures. The concentrations of other pollutants changed little, suggesting that the lockdown measures did not result in strong changes in the emissions from stationary sources.\\ntitle: Changes in short-lived climate pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran, Iran', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 801}), Document(page_content='abstract: Reports of rotavirus excretion in calves usually result from cross-sectional studies, and in face of the conflicting results regarding protection of calves born to vaccinated dams against diarrhea, the aim of the present study was to evaluate rotavirus excretion in dairy calves born to vaccinated or unvaccinated dams, to identify the genotypes of bovine rotavirus group A (RVA) strains isolated from these animals as well as to investigate characteristics of the disease in naturally occurring circumstances throughout the first month of life. Five hundred fifty-two fecal samples were taken from 56 calves, 28 from each farm and, in the vaccinated herd, 11/281 samples (3.91%) taken from six different calves tested positive for RVA while in the unvaccinated herd, 3/271 samples (1.11%) taken from 3 different calves tested positive. The genotyping of the VP7 genes showed 91.2% nucleotide sequence identity to G6 genotype (NCDV strain), and for the VP4 gene, strains from the vaccinated herd were 96.6% related to B223 strain, while strains from the unvaccinated herd were 88% related to P[5] genotype (UK strain). Genotypes found in this study were G6P[11] in the vaccinated herd and G6P[5] in the unvaccinated herd. All calves infected with rotavirus presented an episode of diarrhea in the first month of life, and the discrepancy between the genotypes found in the commercial vaccine (G6P[1] and G10P[11]) and the rotavirus strains circulating in both vaccinated and unvaccinated herds show the importance of keeping constant surveillance in order to avoid potential causes of vaccination failure.\\ntitle: Longitudinal study of bovine rotavirus group A in newborn calves from vaccinated and unvaccinated dairy herds', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 802}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite advances in cystic fibrosis (CF) management and survival, the optimal treatment of pulmonary exacerbations remains unclear. Understanding the variability in treatment approaches among physicians might help prioritise clinical uncertainties to address through clinical trials. METHODS: Physicians from Australia and New Zealand who care for people with CF were invited to participate in a web survey of treatment preferences for CF pulmonary exacerbations. Six typical clinical scenarios were presented; three to paediatric and another three to adult physicians. For each scenario, physicians were asked to choose treatment options and provide reasons for their choices. RESULTS: Forty-nine CF physicians (31 paediatric and 18 adult medicine) participated; more than half reported 10+ years of experience. There was considerable variation in primary antibiotic selection; none was preferred by more than half of respondents in any scenario. For secondary antibiotic therapy, respondents consistently preferred intravenous tobramycin and a third antibiotic was rarely prescribed, except in one scenario describing an adult patient. Hypertonic saline nebulisation and twice daily chest physiotherapy was preferred in most scenarios while dornase alfa use was more variable. Most CF physicians (>80%) preferred to change therapy if there was no early response. Professional opinion was the most common reason for antibiotic choice. CONCLUSIONS: Variation exists among CF physicians in their preferred choice of primary antibiotic and use of dornase alfa. These preferences are driven by professional opinion, possibly reflecting a lack of evidence to base policy recommendations. Evidence from high-quality clinical trials is needed to inform physician decision making.\\ntitle: Variation in treatment preferences of pulmonary exacerbations among Australian and New Zealand cystic fibrosis physicians', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 803}), Document(page_content='abstract: Germ cell tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors that can present primarily as gonadal tumors in either a localized or metastatic pattern.

Thus, group A (n=7) was given G-CSF and group B (n=7) was not. G-CSF therapy reduced both the incidence and duration of ADM-induced oral mucositis, and a positive correlation was also seen between the incidence of mucositis and ADM-induced leukopenia (<2,000/mm(3)). Group A was further divided into two subgroups according to whether G-CSF was given after or before the leukopenia had dropped below 2,000/mm(3): group A-1 (n=3) and group A-2 (n=4), respectively.

Given the steadily increasing importance of accounting for multiple preferences of the decision-makers and assessing the robustness of the decision recommendations, this tool is a timely instrument that can be used primarily by non-multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) experts to dynamically shape and evaluate their indices. The MCDA Index Tool allows the user to (i) input a dataset directly from spreadsheets with alternatives and indicators performance, (ii) build multiple indices by choosing several normalization methods and aggregation functions, and (iii) visualize and compare the indices’ scores and rankings to assess the robustness of the results. A novel perspective on uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of preference models offers operational solutions to assess the influence of different strategies to develop indices and visualize their results. A case study for the assessment of the energy security and sustainability implications of different global energy scenarios is used to illustrate the application of the MCDA Index Tool.

These cells are usually defective for many normal activities or functions due to significant genetic and epigenetic changes. Normal primary cell yields and viability from any original tissue specimens are usually relatively low or highly variable. These normal cells cease after a few passages or population doublings due to very limited proliferative capacity. Animal models (ferret, mouse, etc.) are often used to study virus-host interaction. However, viruses usually need to be adapted to the animals by several passages due to tropism restrictions including viral receptors and intracellular restrictions. Here we summarize applications of conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs), long-term cultures of normal airway epithelial cells from human nose to lung generated by conditional cell reprogramming (CR) technology, as an ex vivo model in studies of emerging viruses. CR allows to robustly propagate cells from non-invasive or minimally invasive specimens, for example, nasal or endobronchial brushing. This process is rapid (2 days) and conditional. The CRCs maintain their differentiation potential and lineage functions, and have been used for studies of adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parvovirus, and SARS-CoV. The CRCs can be easily used for air-liquid interface (ALI) polarized 3D cultures, and these coupled CRC/ALI cultures mimic physiological conditions and are suitable for studies of viral entry including receptor binding and internalization, innate immune responses, viral replications, and drug discovery as an ex vivo model for emerging viruses.\\ntitle: Conditionally Reprogrammed Human Normal Airway Epithelial Cells at ALI: A Physiological Model for Emerging Viruses', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 809}), Document(page_content='abstract: We present a common methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic data, be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer patient. The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same patient. The heterogeneity in a patient’s tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The article is organized as follows. Initially the article explores the basic assumption that deontic operators acquire their meaning via social conventions generating “personal rules” having a “mental content” which belongs to a wider “normative mind”, a mind that obviously encompasses all sorts of choices. The article then describes the different types of personal rules, distinguishing social, moral, and legal rules across the normative mind, focusing on social rules within institutions, conceived as sets of rules in equilibrium. The core of this study puts to the test the taxonomy of personal (social, moral, and legal) rules within the normative mind by exploring a situation of “dense normativity” addressed by a 2021 Lancet paper concerning findings about “tight-loose cultures” during the Covid-19 crisis, and, for the sake of explanation, focuses on one of the main normative constraints that epitomizes the challenge of the Covid-19 crisis to “tight-loose” cultures: the “wear-mask rule”. These observations can be extended to other normative constraints of that crisis, but in essence they parse the interplay between the different types of personal rules, which not only are social, but also moral and legal, drawing conclusions that complement the findings of the Lancet paper with some critical observations. The article critically concludes with remarks about the co-existence of different normative systems of personal rules in a context of biopolitics and suggests that individual morality appears to be the core of normativity to address collective threats such as those caused by the Covid-19 crisis. © 2021 De Gruyter.

Data on confirmed cases, population migration, and socioeconomic factors for 121 counties were collected from 1 December 2019 to 17 February 2020, during which there were a total of 1,328 confirmed cases. County-level infected migrants of Guangdong moving from Hubei were calculated by integrating the incidence rate, population migration data of Baidu Qianxi, and the resident population. Using the spatial autocorrelation method, we identified high-cluster areas of the epidemic. We also used a geographical detector to explore infected migrants and socioeconomic factors associated with transmission of COVID-19 in Guangdong. Our results showed that: 1) the epidemic exhibited significant positive global spatial autocorrelation;high–high spatial clusters were mainly distributed in the Pearl River Estuary region;2) city-level population migration data corroborated with the incidence rate of each city in Hubei showed significant association with confirmed cases;3) in terms of potential factors, infected migrants greatly contributed to the spread of COVID-19, which has strong ability to explain the COVID-19 epidemic;besides, the companies, transport services, residential communities, restaurants, and community facilities were also the dominant factors in the spread of the epidemic;4) the combined effect produced by the intersecting factors can increase the explanatory power.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and its association with mortality using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), specifically global longitudinal strain (GLS) and myocardial work efficiency (MWE). We also tested the hypothesis that reduced myocardial function was associated with increased systemic inflammation in COVID-19. Methods and Results: We conducted a retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing echocardiography (n = 136), of whom 83 and 75 had GLS (abnormal >−16%) and MWE (abnormal <95%) assessed, respectively. We performed adjusted logistic regression to examine associations of GLS and MWE with in-hospital mortality. Patients were mean 62 ± 14 years old (58% men). While 81% had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), prevalence of myocardial dysfunction was high by STE; [39/83 (47%) had abnormal GLS; 59/75 (79%) had abnormal MWE]. Higher MWE was associated with lower in-hospital mortality in unadjusted [OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.85–0.99); p = 0.048] and adjusted models [aOR 0.87 (95% CI 0.78–0.97); p = 0.009]. In addition, increased systemic inflammation measured by interleukin-6 level was associated with reduced MWE. Conclusions: Subclinical myocardial dysfunction is common in COVID-19 patients with clinical echocardiograms, even in those with normal LVEF. Reduced MWE is associated with higher interleukin-6 levels and increased in-hospital mortality.

To inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), testing of patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of their close contacts have been used as major non-pharmaceutical interventions. The advantages of antigen tests, such as low cost and rapid turnaround, may allow for the rapid identification of larger numbers of infectious persons. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Biomed Central databases from inception to January 2, 2021. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 with reference standards were included. We included studies that provided sufficient data to construct a 2 × 2 table on a per-patient basis. Only articles in English were reviewed. Summary sensitivity and specificity for antigen tests were generated using a random-effects model. RESULTS Fourteen studies with 8,624 participants were included. The meta-analysis for antigen testing generated a pooled sensitivity of 79% (95% CI: 66-88%; 14 studies, 8,624 patients) and a pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99-100%; 14 studies, 8,624 patients). The subgroup analysis of studies that reported specimen collection within 7 days after symptom onset showed a pooled sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 78-99%; 4 studies, 1,342 patients) and pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI: 97-100%; 4 studies, 1,342 patients). Regarding the applicability, the patient selection, index tests, and reference standards of studies in our meta-analysis matched the review title. CONCLUSION Antigen tests have moderate sensitivity and high specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests might have a higher sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after symptom onset.

We present results from a naturalistic at-home study in which objective sleep measurements were made using both a wrist actigraph (Actiwatch-2, Philips Respironics) and a non-contact monitoring device (SleepScore Max, SleepScore Labs), comparing sleep measurements obtained immediately before and after the start of the first mandatory COVID-19 stay-at-home order in Washington State. METHODS: As part of a larger study, nine Washington State residents (ages 22–48, 5 female, 4 male; 6 insomniacs, 3 normal sleeper) were enrolled in a 10-week at-home sleep monitoring study, which involved 1 week of actigraphy, 8 weeks of non-contact monitoring (data available for 6 subjects), and 1 week of actigraphy. During the study, the Washington State governor issued a stay-at-home order, effective March 15, 2020. We compared sleep measurements obtained before this date (mean ± SD: 25.0 ± 15.0 nights) and after this date (25.2 ± 13.9 nights) using mixed-effects ANOVA. RESULTS: Non-contact monitoring measurements indicated that after the start of the lockdown, participants woke up later by 63.2 ± 12.1 min (mean ± SE; F[1,299]=27.40, p<0.001) without significant change in bedtime (F[1,299]=0.29, p=0.59). Sleep latency lengthened by 4.0 ± 2.3 min (F[1,295]=4.92, p=0.027), and there were increases in number of awakenings (F[1,295]=6.22, p=0.013) and wake after sleep onset (F[1,295]=12.58, p<0.001). Actigraphy data complemented these results, showing delayed sleep onset by 53.4 ± 15.1 min (F[1,101]=12.46, p<0.001) and delayed final awakening by 104.3 ± 19.6 min (F[1,101]=28.43, p<0.001), with longer sleep duration (F[1,101]=6.06, p=0.016), increased number of awakenings (F[1,101]=13.00, p<0.001), and a trend for increased intermittent wakefulness (F[1,101]=3.88, p=0.052) post-lockdown. CONCLUSION: In this sample, we found evidence of increased sleep disruption following the first Washington State stay-at-home order related to COVID-19. Our findings are consistent with previous studies based on self-report data, which observed later wake times and decreases in sleep quality post-lockdown. SUPPORT (IF ANY): NIH grant KL2TR002317.

For India, reliable baseline prepandemic mortality patterns at national and subnational level are necessary for such assessments. However, available data from the Civil Registration System (CRS) is affected by incompleteness of death recording that varies by sex, age and location. METHODS: Under-reporting of CRS 2019 deaths was assessed for three age groups (< 5 years, 15–59 years and ≥60 years) at subnational level, through comparison with age-specific death rates from alternate sources. Age-specific corrections for under-reporting were applied to derive adjusted death counts by sex for each location. These were used to compute life expectancy (LE) at birth by sex in 2019, which were compared with subnational LEs from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 Study. RESULTS: A total of 9.92 million deaths (95% UI 9.70 to 10.02) were estimated across India in 2019, about 2.28 million more than CRS reports. Adjustments to under-five and elderly mortality accounted for 30% and 56% of additional deaths, respectively. Adjustments in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh accounted for 75% of all additional deaths. Adjusted LEs were below corresponding GBD estimates by ≥2 years for males at national level and in 20 states, and by ≥1 year for females in 12 states. CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first-ever subnational mortality estimates for India derived from CRS reported deaths, and serve as a baseline for assessing excess mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted life expectancies indicate higher mortality patterns in India than previously perceived. Under-reporting of infant deaths and those among women and the elderly is evident in many locations. Further CRS strengthening is required to improve the empirical basis for local mortality measurement across the country.\\ntitle: Subnational mortality estimates for India in 2019: a baseline for evaluating excess deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 823}), Document(page_content='abstract: INTRODUCTION: the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Brazilian North region is worrying.

We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T ≥ 37.5 °C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1–June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7–8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. CONCLUSIONS: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization. In the future infectious disease prevention and control practice, M. pneumoniae should be paid more attention. It is necessary to establish and improve the pathogen and drug resistance surveillance system in order to prevent and control such mutated strains of M. pneumoniae from causing future outbreaks or epidemics in China.\\ntitle: Outbreak of macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumoniae in a primary school in Beijing, China in 2018', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 825}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus, has been rapidly spreading worldwide since December 2019, causing a public health crisis. Recent studies showed SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect humans via airborne routes. These motivated the study of aerosol and airborne droplet transmission in a variety of settings. This study performs a large-scale numerical simulation of a real-world dentistry clinic that contains aerosol-generating procedures. The simulation tracks the dispersion of evaporating droplets emitted during ultrasonic dental scaling procedures. The simulation considers 25 patient treatment cubicles in an open plan dentistry clinic. The droplets are modeled as having a volatile (evaporating) and nonvolatile fraction composed of virions, saliva, and impurities from the irrigant water supply. The simulated clinic's boundary and flow conditions are validated against experimental measurements of the real clinic. The results evaluate the behavior of large droplets and aerosols. We investigate droplet residence time and travel distance for different droplet diameters, surface contamination due to droplet settling and deposition, airborne aerosol mass concentration, and the quantity of droplets that escape through ventilation. The simulation results raise concerns due to the aerosols' long residence times (averaging up to 7.31 min) and travel distances (averaging up to 24.45 m) that exceed social distancing guidelines. Finally, the results show that contamination extends beyond the immediate patient treatment areas, requiring additional surface disinfection in the clinic. The results presented in this research may be used to establish safer dental clinic operating procedures, especially if paired with future supplementary material concerning the aerosol viral load generated by ultrasonic scaling and the viral load thresholds required to infect humans.\\ntitle: Computer simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 contamination risk in a large dental clinic\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 826}), Document(page_content='abstract: Analysis is a key part of usability testing where UX practitioners seek to identify usability problems and generate redesign suggestions.

It inhibits host-cell translation, primarily through a direct interaction between its C-terminal domain and the mRNA entry channel of the 40S small ribosomal subunit, with an N-terminal β-barrel domain fine-tuning the inhibition and promoting selective translation of viral mRNA. SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 is a target of recurring deletions, some of which are associated with altered COVID-19 disease progression. To provide the biochemical basis for this, it is essential to characterize the efficiency of translational inhibition by the said protein variants. Here, we use an in vitro translation system to investigate the translation inhibition capacity of a series of clinically observed Nsp1 deletion variants. We find that a frequently observed deletion of residues 79-89 destabilized the N-terminal domain (NTD) and severely reduced the capacity of Nsp1 to inhibit translation. Interestingly, shorter deletions in the same region have been reported to effect the type I interferon response but did not affect translation inhibition, indicating a possible translation-independent role of the Nsp1 NTD in interferon response modulation. Taken together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how deletions in Nsp1 influence SARS-CoV-2 induction of interferon response and COVID-19 progression.\\ntitle: Clinically observed deletions in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 affect protein stability and its ability to inhibit translation', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 828}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is important to monitor epidemic dynamics. Given difficulties of large-scale RT-PCR implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as alternatives in settings such as Mexico. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate diagnostic performance of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications compared to RT-PCR testing in Mexico. METHODS: We analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology up to December 31st, 2020 (n=3,374,165) and cases with both RT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n=18,446). We evaluated diagnostic performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in AUROC. We also explored test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 and mortality. RESULTS: Rapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6-38.7), high specificity 95.4% (95%CI 95.1-95.8) and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0-86.6) and negative predictive values 67.2% (95%CI 66.2-69.2). Rapid Ag-T has optimal diagnostic performance up to days 7-10 after symptom, and its performance is modified by testing location, comorbidity, and age. RT-PCR(-) / Rapid Ag-T(+) cases had higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes and were older, RT-PCR(+)/ Rapid Ag-T(-) cases had slightly higher risk or adverse outcomes and [≥]7 days from symptom onset. Cases detected with rapid Ag-T were younger, without comorbidities, and milder COVID-19 course.

Atrial fibrillation often goes undetected with traditional electrocardiogram monitoring techniques. We evaluated whether atrial fibrillation detection using continuous long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor is cost-effective for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke, in comparison to the standard of care. METHODS A lifetime Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of insertable cardiac monitors from a UK National Health Service perspective using data from the randomized CRYSTAL-AF trial and other published literature. We also conducted scenario analyses (CHADS2 score) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS Monitoring cryptogenic stroke patients with an insertable cardiac monitor was associated with fewer recurrent strokes and increased quality-adjusted life years compared to the standard of care (7.37 vs 7.22). Stroke-related costs were reduced in insertable cardiac monitor patients, but overall costs remained higher than the standard of care (£19,631 vs £17,045). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £17,175 per quality-adjusted life years gained, compared to standard of care in the base-case scenario, which is below established quality-adjusted life years willingness-to-pay thresholds. When warfarin replaced non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants as the main anticoagulation therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £13,296 per quality-adjusted life years gained. CONCLUSION Insertable cardiac monitors are a cost-effective diagnostic tool for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke.

Early data have demonstrated how the host response to this novel coronavirus leads to the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, massive endothelial damage, and generalized vascular manifestations. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the upper and lower respiratory tract, other organ systems are also affected. SARS-CoV-2 relies on 2 host cell receptors for successful attachment: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2. Clinicopathologic reports have demonstrated associations between severe COVID-19 and viral coagulopathy, resulting in pulmonary embolism; venous, arterial, and microvascular thrombosis; lung endothelial injury; and associated thrombotic complications leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Viral coagulopathy is not novel given similar observations with SARS classic, including the consumption of platelets, generation of thrombin, and increased fibrin degradation product exhibiting overt disseminated intravascular coagulation-like syndrome. The specific mechanism(s) behind the thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients has yet to be fully understood. Parenteral anticoagulants, such as heparin and low-molecular-weights heparins, are widely used in the management of COVID-19 patients. Beyond the primary (anticoagulant) effects of these agents, they may exhibit antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects. Direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are also useful in the management of these patients. Tissue plasminogen activator and other fibrinolytic modalities may also be helpful in the overall management. Catheter-directed thrombolysis can be used in patients developing pulmonary embolism.

The present review has aimed to gather and categorize all implemented drugs based on the susceptible virulence mechanisms, and the pathophysiological events in the host cells, discussing and suggesting treatments. RESULTS: As a result, the COVID-19 lifecycle were categorized as following steps: “Host Cell Attachment” which is mainly conducted with ACE(2) receptors and TMPRSS2 from the host cell and Spike (S) protein, “Endocytosis Pathway” which is performed mainly by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and “Viral Replication” which contains translation and replication of RNA viral genome. The virus pathogenicity is continued by “Inflammatory Reactions” which mainly caused moderate to severe COVID-19 disease. Besides, the possible effective therapeutics’ mechanism and the pharmaceutical agents that had at least one experience as a preclinical or clinical study on COVID-19 were clearly defined.

A multivariate analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with early intubation (before H8 following vasopressor onset). RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-nine patients were enrolled. Two hundred and nine patients were intubated early (24%, range 4.5–47%), across the 18 centers with at least 20 patients included. The cumulative intubation rate during the ICU stay was 324/859 (38%, range 14–65%). In the multivariate analysis, seven parameters were significantly associated with early intubation and ranked as follows by decreasing weight: Glasgow score, center effect, use of accessory respiratory muscles, lactate level, vasopressor dose, pH and inability to clear tracheal secretions. Global R-square of the model was only 60% indicating that 40% of the variability of the intubation process was related to other parameters than those entered in this analysis.

Cross-sectional surveys were collected pre-electronic medical record implementation prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2019, and 18-months post-electronic medical record implementation during the pandemic in 2020, and findings compared. RESULTS: A total of 942 surveys were analysed (550 pre-electronic medical record (response rate 15.52%) and 392 post-electronic medical record (response rate 9.50%)). Post-electronic medical record, nurses’ work satisfaction (r = 0.23, p=<0.001), intention to stay (r = 0.11, p = 0.001) and well-being (r = 0.17, p=<0.001) decreased. Nurses’ perceived competence increased (r = 0.10, p = 0.002) despite decreased autonomy (r = 0.10, p = 0.003). Two of three dimensions of work engagement worsened (vigour r = 0.13, p=<0.001; dedication r = 0.13, p=<0.001) and all dimensions of burnout increased (exhaustion r = 0.08, p = 0.012, cynicism r = 0.07, p = 0.04 and reduced efficiency r = 0.32, p=<0.001).

METHODS: From 25 January to 29 March 2020, all URT and LRT samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 received in the virology laboratory of Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital (Paris, France) were simultaneously tested for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1423 consecutive patients were tested: 677 (47.6%) males, 746 (52.4%) females, median age 50 (range, 1-103) years. Twenty-one (1.5%) patients were positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in LRT than in URT (53.6% vs. 13.4%; p<0.0001). The analysis of paired samples from 117 (8.2%) patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 load was lower in URT than in LRT samples in 65% of cases. CONCLUSION: The detection of other respiratory viruses in patients during this epidemic period could not rule out SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Furthermore, LRT samples increased the accuracy of diagnosis of COVID-19.\\ntitle: Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses and performance of lower respiratory tract samples for the diagnosis of COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 840}), Document(page_content='abstract: Motivation Infections by RNA viruses such as Influenza, HIV still pose a serious threat to human health despite extensive research on viral diseases. One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. Results We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction.

This study was designed to investigate health-related aspects of individuals with CF, with and without lung transplantation (LTX), their communication with their specialist healthcare providers during the pandemic, potential changes in peoples’ individual therapy regimes and daily physical activity levels. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among Swiss adults with CF with and without LTX, study period from March 16th, 2020 – the day the “extraordinary situation” was officially declared in Switzerland introducing stringent measures protecting the public – until May 16(th), 2020. RESULTS: 327 individuals (25% LTX recipients) were included, 45 individuals reported coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) like symptoms. Of 28 subjects tested, only three subjects were tested positive, all with mild symptoms, no hospitalization required. Almost half of the survey respondents (45%) reported undertaking less physical activity during the lockdown, while 79% and 91% of participants reported no change in traditional airway clearance and inhalation therapies, respectively. Distress regarding a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection or worsening of lung disease were no major concerns for subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on clinical outcomes of individuals with CF was mild although people with chronic lung diseases like CF are considered a high-risk population; overall, this is reassuring.

The aerosol (defined as droplets smaller than 5 m resulting from 30 seconds of continued speech has o(1h) settling time and a viable viral dose an order-of-magnitude higher than in a short cough. The time-of-flight to reach 2m is only a few seconds resulting in a viral dose above the minimum required for infection, implying that physical distancing in the absence of ventilation is not sufficient to provide safety for long exposure times. The suspended aerosol emitted by continuous speaking for 1 hour in a poorly ventilated room gives 0.1-11% infection risk for initial viral loads of 10^8-10^10 copies/ml, respectively, decreasing to 0.03-3% for 10 air changes per hour by ventilation.

The Spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains at least three regions that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the S1 and S2 domains. We previously characterized a panel of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) but the majority of epitopes recognized by the MAbs remained unknown. METHODS: In this study we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as in vitro and in vivo fitness. RESULTS: Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles. We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a mechanism to overcome neutralization escape by using broadly cross reactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor binding domain, critical for virus replication and virulence.\\ntitle: Escape from Human Monoclonal Antibody Neutralization Affects In Vitro and In Vivo Fitness of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 844}), Document(page_content='abstract: 新型冠状病毒疾病(COVID-19)在全球暴发流行,呼吸道以外的感染症状亦倍受关注 本文对国内外新型冠状病毒感染皮肤表现进行综述分析,以提高皮肤科医师对新型冠状病毒感染相关皮肤损害的识别能力\\ntitle: Cutaneous manifestations associated with Coronavirus Disease ( COVID-19)', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 845}), Document(page_content='abstract: Given the evidence for a hyperactive platelet phenotype in COVID-19, we investigated effector cell properties of COVID-19 platelets on endothelial cells (ECs).

We identified S100A8 and S100A9 as transcripts enriched in COVID-19 platelets and were induced by megakaryocyte infection with SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with increased gene expression, the heterodimer protein product of S100A8/A9, myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8/14, was released to a greater extent by platelets from COVID-19 patients relative to controls.

A new food sourcing mechanism, community-based online group grocery-ordering (CoGGO), was widely adopted by households, particularly among the youngest group studied (18–24 years of age). The same group showed a higher confidence in the food supply system during the quarantine and a greater propensity for weight gain while staying-at-home.

This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS). In addition, important RNTD TPs responsible for NDMA-FP (e.g., chlorinated and hydroxylated RNTD: TP-364) were also confirmed by the relationship between detected peak area and NDMA-FP.

Methods: Two pulmonologists, two radiologists, and two pathologists reviewed 27 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia as the main diagnosis made by non-pulmonologists. To evaluate whether the contribution of specialists, individually and/or in combination, might modify the original diagnosis, a three-step virtual process was planned. The whole lung examination was considered the gold standard for the final diagnosis. The probability of a correct diagnosis was calculated using a model based on generalized estimating equations. The effectiveness of a multidisciplinary diagnosis was obtained by comparing diagnoses made by experienced pulmonologists with those made by non-pulmonologists. Results: In 19% of cases, the diagnosis of COVID-19-related death was mainly incorrect. The probability of a correct diagnosis increased strikingly from an undedicated clinician to an expert specialist. Every single specialist made significantly more correct diagnoses than any non-pulmonologist. The highest level of accuracy was achieved by the combination of 3 expert specialists (p = 0.0003).

Although the influent water quality changed dramatically, the effluent from the experiment tank had a substantially lower percentage increase in water quality parameters compared with the effluent from the control. It was found that in the experiment tank, 75.8% of FW TSS was degraded, whereas only 36.7% of sewage TSS was degraded, and that 18.8% of FW TSS and 44.9% of sewage TSS accumulated in the experiment tank. The addition of FW increased the scum accumulation, even though the dry matter of the scum layer was much less in quantity than the sludge layer. It also increased the lipid content in the sludge. The increase in the scum layer was mainly due to the increase in protein from the addition of the FW.

The correlation between local concentration of cytokines and severity of disease as well as serum acute phase proteins (APP) concentration has been also studied. RESULTS: All co-infected pigs had fever, while in single inoculated pigs fever was observed only in part of animals. Necropsy revealed lesions in the lungs all SIV-inoculated and co-inoculated pigs, while in Hps-single inoculated animals only 1 out of 11 pigs revealed gross lung lesions. The SIV shedding was the highest in co-inoculated pigs. There were no differences between Hps-single inoculated and co-inoculated groups with regard to Hps shedding.

In single-inoculated animals various kinetics of APP response has been observed. The lung concentrations of cytokines were induced mostly in SIV + Hps pigs in the apical and middle lobe. These results correlated well with localization of gross lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that SIV increased the severity of lung lesions and facilitated Hps (PIWetHps192/2015) replication in the porcine lung. Furthermore, Hps influenced the SIV nasal shedding. Enhanced Hps and SIV replication, together with stronger systemic and local inflammatory response contributed to a more severe clinical signs and stronger, earlier immune response in co-inoculated animals. We confirmed the previous evidence that single-Hps infection does not produce significant pneumonic lesions but it should be in mind that other strains of Hps may produce lesions different from that reported in the present study.\\ntitle: Coinfection modulates inflammatory responses, clinical outcome and pathogen load of H1N1 swine influenza virus and Haemophilus parasuis infections in pigs', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 861}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: Lung segmentation is a significant step in developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using Chest Radiographs (CRs).

In this paper, we present the implementation of our ensemble deep learning model for lung segmentation. This model is based on the original DeepLabV3+, which is the extended model of DeepLabV3. Our model utilizes various architectures as a backbone of DeepLabV3+, such as ResNet18, ResNet50, Mobilenetv2, Xception, and inceptionresnetv2. We improved the encoder module of DeepLabV3+ by adjusting the receptive field of the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP). We also studied our algorithm's performance on a publicly available dataset provided by Shenzhen Hospital, that contains 566 CRs with manually segmented lungs (ground truth).

Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID-19. Nonstructural protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development. We have performed in silico based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID-19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules. Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia, respectively, were selected as stronger binder of EndoU. Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250, and Lys290. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU. The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be -141 ± 11 and -136 ± 16 kJ/mol, respectively. The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2 µM and 30 µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin, respectively. Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than to uridine monophosphate (UMP). Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å2 by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide. However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

They are particularly numerous in the field of health, contributing to the movement called ehealth. What is the potential role of these devices as prevention supports? The purpose of this article is to provide an exploratory analysis of the use, efficacy and contribution to conventional prevention strategies. METHODS To address this issue, we conducted a scoping-review on the basis of 105 publications from the fields of medicine and human sciences. RESULTS Three dimensions of the use of smart devices in the field of health were identified: 1/a quantification tool allowing the users to measure their activities; 2/a tool of self-positioning in the community; 3/an interface between the medical world and the population, modifying the hierarchy of knowledge. However, few published studies have investigated the determinants of the efficacy of these devices and their impact on individual behaviours and professional health practices. CONCLUSION Based on the hypothesis of possible integration of these devices in prevention policies, it would be interesting to investigate two research issues: how and under what psycho-socio-environmental conditions can smart devices contribute to the adoption of positive health behaviours? To what degree does the use of smart devices modify the health care professional-patient relationship? Finding answers to these questions could help to define the real place of these devices in prevention strategies by determining their complementarity with respect to other prevention strategies, and the conditions of their efficacy on behaviours and inequalities.\\ntitle: Exploratory study of the implications of research on the use of smart connected devices for prevention: a scoping review.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 868}), Document(page_content='abstract: Background.

Methods Prospective study based on structured questionnaires and additional outcomes. Results 304/354 patients completing the survey at baseline also completed the follow-up interview (85.9%; median [range] age, 47 [18-76] years; 185 [60.9%] women).

Assuming a pre-vaccination reproduction number for the Delta variant of 5, we show that for the current Mixed program of vaccinating over 60s with AstraZeneca and 16-60s with Pfizer we would not achieve herd immunity. We would need to cover 85% of the population (including many 5-16 year-olds to achieve herd immunity). At lower reproduction number of 3 and our current Mixed strategy, we can achieve herd immunity without vaccinating 5-15 year olds. This will be achieved at a 60% coverage pursuing a strategy targetting high transmitters or 70% coverage using a strategy targetting the vulnerable first. A reproduction number of 7 precludes achieving herd immunity, however vaccination is able to prevent 75% of deaths compared with no vaccination. We also examine the impact of vaccination on death in the event that herd immunity is not achieved. Direct effects of vaccination on reducing death are very good for both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. However we estimate that the Mixed or Pfizer program performs better than the AstraZeneca program. Furthermore, vaccination levels below the herd immunity threshold can lead to substantial (albeit incomplete) indirect protection for both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Epistemonikos COVID-19 in LOVE Platform, and McMaster COVID-19 Evidence Alerts, and select websites were searched to 15 June 2020. Studies needed to be conducted in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and have used multivariate analyses to adjust for potential confounders. After piloting, screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were all performed by a single reviewer. Authors collaborated to synthesize the findings narratively and appraise the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. Results: Of 3,740 unique records identified, 34 were included in the review. The studies included median 596 (range 44 to 418,794) participants with a mean age between 42 and 84 years. Half of the studies (17/34) were conducted in the United States and 19/34 (56%) were rated as good quality. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large ([≥]2-fold) association with increased risk of hospitalization in people having confirmed COVID-19, for the following risk factors: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age over 45 years (vs. younger), male gender, Black race/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic white), homelessness, and low income (vs. above average). Age over 60 and 70 years may be associated with large increases in the rate of mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large association with increased risk may exist for liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs. British white), age over 45 years (vs. <45 years), age over 80 years (vs. 65-69 years), and male gender in those 20-64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalization and mortality may be very large ([≥]5-fold increased risk) for those aged over 60 years. Conclusion: Among other factors, increasing age (especially >60 years) appears to be the most important risk factor for severe outcomes among those with COVID-19. There is a need for high quality primary research (accounting for multiple confounders) to better understand the level of risk that might be associated with immigration or refugee status, religion or belief system, social capital, substance use disorders, pregnancy, Indigenous identity, living with a disability, and differing levels of risk among children.

We addressed the suitability of EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood as an alternative sample material for antibody testing against SARS-CoV-2 by electro-CLIA (ECLIA; Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and ELISA (IgG and IgA; Euroimmun, Germany). Simultaneously drawn venous serum and EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples from 223 individuals were included. Correction of the whole blood results for hematocrit led to a good agreement with the serum results for weakly to moderately positive antibody signals. In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, all three assays displayed comparable diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) using corrected whole blood and serum (AUCs: 0.97 for ECLIA and IgG ELISA; 0.84 for IgA ELISA).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of dietary Ferulic acid against Lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatic injuries in Tianfu broiler chickens. The results showed that supplementation of FA in daily feed increased body weight (BW) and decreased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in LPS treatment broilers significantly (p < 0.05). Additionally, supplement of FA alleviated histological changes and apoptosis of hepatocytes in LPS treatment broilers. Supplement of FA significantly decreases the activities of ROS. Interestingly, the levels of antioxidant parameters including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and glutathione (GSH) in LPS group were significantly increased by the FA supplementation (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, administration of LPS to broilers decreased the expressions of Nrf2, NQO1, SOD, GSH-Px, CAT and Bcl-2, whereas it increased the expressions of Bax and Caspase-3 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expressions of Nrf2, NQO1, SOD, CAT, Bcl-2 were significantly upregulated and Caspase-3 were significantly downregulated in the FL group when compared to LPS group (p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to expand on the literature on the impact of the pandemic on college students by a) examining domains of impact of the pandemic on psychiatric and alcohol outcomes and b) controlling for pre-pandemic outcomes. METHOD: Participants included 897 college students (78.6% female) from a larger longitudinal study on college student mental health. Structural equation models were fit to examine how COVID-19 impact (exposure, worry, food/housing insecurity, change in social media use, change in substance use) were associated with PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and alcohol phenotypes. Models were fit to adjust for pre-pandemic symptoms. RESULTS: No effects of COVID-19 exposure remained after adjusting for earlier outcomes. COVID-19 worry predicted PTSD, depression, and anxiety, even after adjusting for earlier levels of outcomes (β’s: .091–.180, p’s < .05). Housing/food concerns predicted PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as suicidal ideation (β’s: .085–.551, p’s < .05) after adjusting for earlier levels of symptoms. Change in media use predicted alcohol consumption (β’s: ± .116−.197, p’s < .05). Change in substance use affected all outcomes except suicidality (β’s: .112–.591, p’s < .05).

Traditionally, Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV) were considered the major causative agents. Lately, new pathogens have been implicated in the development of CIRDC, namely canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. To better understand the role of the different pathogens in the development of CIRDC and their epidemiological relevance in Europe, prevalence data were collected from peer-reviewed publications and summarized. Evidence of exposure to Bb is frequently found in healthy and diseased dogs and client-owned dogs are as likely to be infected as kennelled dogs. Co-infections with viral pathogens are common. The findings confirm that Bb is an important cause of CIRDC in Europe. CAV-2 and CDV recovery rates from healthy and diseased dogs are low and the most likely explanation for this is control through vaccination. Seroconversion to CHV can be demonstrated following CIRDC outbreaks and CHV has been detected in the lower respiratory tract of diseased dogs. There is some evidence that CHV is not a primary cause of CIRDC, but opportunistically re-activates at the time of infection and exacerbates the disease. The currently available data suggest that CIV is, at present, neither a prevalent nor a significant pathogen in Europe. CPiV remains an important pathogen in CIRDC and facilitates co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens. CnPnV and CRCoV are important new elements in the aetiology of CIRDC and spread particularly well in multi-dog establishments. M. cynos is common in Europe and is more likely to occur in younger and kennelled dogs. This organism is frequently found together with other CIRDC pathogens and is significantly associated with more severe respiratory signs. S. zooepidemicus infection is not common and appears to be a particular problem in kennels. Protective immunity against respiratory diseases is rarely complete, and generally only a reduction in clinical signs and excretion of pathogen can be achieved through vaccination. However, even vaccines that only reduce and do not prevent infection carry epidemiological advantages. They reduce spread, increase herd immunity and decrease usage of antimicrobials. Recommending vaccination of dogs against pathogens of CIRDC will directly provide epidemiological advantages to the population and the individual dog.\\ntitle: Aetiology of Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex and Prevalence of its Pathogens in Europe', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 880}), Document(page_content='abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel illness, which is not fully understood. Whether an individual has traveled outside their respective country or never left their community, COVID-19 is a highly contagious illness, which can result in high death rates. Biobanks will play a role in providing tools to examine data from those receiving treatment along with reviewing the current and long treatment outcomes associated with this novel coronavirus disease. A diverse, global network made up of laboratory scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, data science teams, physicians, and so on must have a standardized, collaborative, virtual biobanking solution to share clinical expertise and evidence-based solutions. This virtual biobank must be centrally managed to ensure standardized quality assurance and quality control efforts. Virtual biobanks will eliminate the need to transport samples between two locations for a specific study, minimizing the risk of contamination. It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Standardized, collected information will be essential in the area of discovery and validation of disease markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies. It is essential for biobanks to collect COVID-19 specimens along with corresponding clinical and demographic data from COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Because COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness, proper collection procedures must be in place to collect respiratory samples for biobanking purposes.

However, the incidence of VTE after discharge and whether postdischarge thromboprophylaxis is beneficial and safe are unclear. In this prospective observational single-center study, we report the incidence of VTE 6 weeks after hospitalization and the use of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were invited to a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic 6 weeks after discharge. D-dimer and C-reactive protein were measured, and all patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis with venous duplex-ultrasound. Additionally, selected high-risk patients received computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan to screen for incidental pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Of 485 consecutive patients hospitalized from March through June 2020, 146 patients were analyzed, of which 39% had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 28% of patients, but was used more frequently after ICU stay (61%) and in patients with higher maximal D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization. Six weeks after discharge, elevated D-dimer values were present in 32% of ward and 42% of ICU patients. Only one asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.7%) and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.7%) were diagnosed with systematic screening. No bleedings were reported. CONCLUSION: In patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19, systematic screening for VTE 6 weeks after discharge revealed a low incidence of VTE. A strategy of selectively providing postdischarge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients seems safe and potentially effective.\\ntitle: Venous Thromboembolism in Patients Discharged after COVID-19 Hospitalization', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 882}), Document(page_content='abstract: INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease is a systemic progressive inflammatory autoimmune disorder. Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS: A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION: Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).\\ntitle: A novel approach utilizing laser acupuncture teletherapy for management of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized clinical trial', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 883}), Document(page_content='abstract: The effect of labor market inequalities during economic crises is a well-established topic. Yet, little is known about this in the contexts of developing countries. We use recently collected phone survey data by Young Lives from four countries—Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State), Peru and Vietnam—to examine whether men and women suffer from coronavirus-triggered economic hardship differently. We find that men are more likely to lose jobs and income in Ethiopia and India—countries with a very high male-dominated formal sector. Conversely, gender effect is not significant in Peru and Vietnam with comparatively higher integration of women in formal employment. We further investigate whether gender effect varies by ‘wealth’ level. Findings suggests that only in India, in the wealthier group, men are more likely to face job and income loss than women, possibly indicating greater male concentration in higher-class occupations. However, gender differences in facing hardship by wealth group is not significant for other countries.\\ntitle: Gender Differences in Experiencing Coronavirus-Triggered Economic Hardship: Evidence from Four Developing Countries', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 884}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: BACKGROUND: Air pollution is one of the world's leading mortality risk factors contributing to seven million deaths annually. COVID-19 pandemic has claimed about one million deaths in less than a year. However, it is unclear whether exposure to acute and chronic air pollution influences the COVID-19 epidemiologic curve. METHODS: We searched for relevant studies listed in six electronic databases between December 2019 and September 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits. Studies presented as original articles, studies that assessed risk, incidence, prevalence, or lethality of COVID-19 in relation with exposure to either short-term or long-term exposure to ambient air pollution were included. All patients regardless of age, sex and location diagnosed as having COVID-19 of any severity were taken into consideration. We synthesised results using harvest plots based on effect direction. RESULTS: Included studies were cross-sectional (n = 10), retrospective cohorts (n = 9), ecological (n = 6 of which two were time-series) and hypothesis (n = 1). Of these studies, 52 and 48% assessed the effect of short-term and long-term pollutant exposure, respectively and one evaluated both. Pollutants mostly studied were PM2.5 (64%), NO2 (50%), PM10 (43%) and O3 (29%) for acute effects and PM2.5 (85%), NO2 (39%) and O3 (23%) then PM10 (15%) for chronic effects. Most assessed COVID-19 outcomes were incidence and mortality rate. Acutely, pollutants independently associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality were first PM2.5 then PM10, NO2 and O3 (only for incident cases). Chronically, similar relationships were found for PM2.5 and NO2. High overall risk of bias judgments (86 and 39% in short-term and long-term exposure studies, respectively) was predominantly due to a failure to adjust aggregated data for important confounders, and to a lesser extent because of a lack of comparative analysis. CONCLUSION: The body of evidence indicates that both acute and chronic exposure to air pollution can affect COVID-19 epidemiology. The evidence is unclear for acute exposure due to a higher level of bias in existing studies as compared to moderate evidence with chronic exposure. Public health interventions that help minimize anthropogenic pollutant source and socio-economic injustice/disparities may reduce the planetary threat posed by both COVID-19 and air pollution pandemics.\\ntitle: Acute and chronic exposure to air pollution in relation with incidence, prevalence, severity and mortality of COVID-19: a rapid systematic review\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 885}), Document(page_content='abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has once again highlighted the importance of access to sufficient quantities of safe water and sanitation in public health.

In Europe, 29.9% of the isolates are oxacillin-resistant. The changing epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections and the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. The objective of our study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the associated molecular mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains isolated from the endotracheal tubes (ETT) of intubated critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, gentamicin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and tetracycline were measured. Resistance mechanisms were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: S. aureus isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The most frequent mutations in quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains were S84L in the gyrA gene, V511A in the gyrB gene, S144P in the grlA gene, and K401R/E in the grlB gene. Strains resistant to erythromycin carried the ermC, ermA, and msrA genes; the same ermC and ermA genes were detected in strains resistant to clindamycin. The aac(6′)-aph(2″) gene was related to gentamicin resistance, while resistance to tetracycline was related to tetK (efflux pump). The fusB gene was detected in the strain resistant to fusidic acid. The most frequent sequence types were ST22, ST8, and ST217, which were distributed in four clonal complexes (CC5, CC22, CC45, and CC59). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of resistance to second-line antimicrobials threatens the treatment of nosocomial respiratory infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus with decreased susceptibility to linezolid and vancomycin. The wide genotypic diversity found reinforces the central role of ICU infection control in preventing nosocomial transmission.\\ntitle: Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains from the endotracheal tubes of patients with nosocomial pneumonia', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 887}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE: Racial/ethnic disparities in obesity may be due, in part, to minority groups consuming more energy-rich diets in response to greater stress exposure. The present study systematically reviewed the literature describing the effects of stress on food consumption among various racial/ethnic groups in the US. METHODS: PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies reporting associations between stress and food consumption by different racial/ethnic groups, conducted between January 1, 1999 to November 25, 2019. The search included terms related to food consumption, stress, and race/ethnicity. After screening 3660 records, 30 studies were included for review. RESULTS: The selected studies assessed diverse stressors and eating constructs; African-American and Hispanic/Latinx were the most commonly studied minority groups. Studies generally supported that diverse forms of stress exposure are associated with reduced healthy eating patterns and increased obesogenic eating patterns across racial/ethnic groups. However, studies that directly compared stress-eating associations among multiple racial/ethnic groups showed mixed results. CONCLUSION: Members of diverse racial/ethnic groups are susceptible to stress-induced unhealthy eating patterns, though evidence is insufficient to conclude whether the degree of susceptibility differs among groups. Additional studies utilizing observational measures of food intake and culturally sensitive measures of stress are needed to identify the most influential stressors on dietary behaviors, to assess whether some stressors are more salient for given racial/ethnic groups, and to examine the extent to which stress-induced eating contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related diseases.\\ntitle: Stress-Induced Eating Among Racial/Ethnic Groups in the United States: a Systematic Review', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 888}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: The analysis of correlation structures among multivariate spatially aggregated data has become increasingly important and poses substantial challenges This article concerns the development of partial and semi-partial statistics of spatial associations in the context of multivariate spatial areal data extending Moran's I and Geary's C The proposed statistical tools describe global or local associations among spatially aggregated measurements for pairs of different components conditional on all remaining components The new statistics are tested through a simulation study and illustrated using aggregated data on the COVID-19 pandemic recorded at the Community level in Spain © 2020 The Ohio State University\\ntitle: Partial and Semi-Partial Statistics of Spatial Associations for Multivariate Areal Data\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 889}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, social networks become the preeminent medium for communication, social discussion, and entertainment.

In this paper, we investigate the reactions and attitudes of people towards topics raised on social media platforms. We collected data of two large-scale COVID-19 datasets from Twitter and Instagram for six and three months, respectively. The paper analyzes the reaction of social network users on different aspects including sentiment analysis, topics detection, emotions, and geo-temporal characteristics of our dataset. We show that the dominant sentiment reactions on social media are neutral while the most discussed topics by social network users are about health issues. The paper examines the countries that attracted more posts and reactions from people, as well as the distribution of health-related topics discussed in the most mentioned countries. We shed light on the temporal shift of topics over countries.

Moreover, in vitro tests were performed to evaluate the antifungal activity of these EOs on Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Fusarium solani. Secondly, the EO antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus pseudointermedius was examined, and their antiviral efficacy against the H1N1 influenza virus was assessed. Leaf volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as the EOs obtained from the arial part of Salvia scabra, were characterized by a high percentage of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (97.8% and 76.6%, respectively), mostly represented by an equal amount of germacrene D (32.8% and 32.7%, respectively). Both leaf and flower spontaneous emissions of S. dentata, as well as the EO composition, showed a prevalence of monoterpenes divided into a more or less equal amount of hydrocarbon and oxygenated compounds. Interestingly, its EO had a non-negligible percentage of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (29.5%). S. aurea EO, on the contrary, was rich in sesquiterpenes, both hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds (41.5% and 33.5%, respectively). S. dentata EO showed good efficacy (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC): 0.5%) against M. canis. The tested EOs were not active against E. coli and S. aureus, whereas a low inhibition of S. dentata EO was observed on S. pseudointermedius (MIC = 10%). Once again, S. dentata EO showed a very good H1N1 inhibition; contrariwise, S. aurea EO was completely inactive against this virus.

The federal Right-to-Try Act created an additional pathway for non-trial access to experimental drugs without institutional review board or FDA approval. This removal of oversight amplifies the responsibility of physicians, but little is known about the role of practicing physicians in non-trial access to investigational drugs. We undertook semi-structured interviews to capture the experiences and opinions of 21 oncologists all with previous EA experience at a major cancer center. We found five main themes. Participants with greater EA experience reported less difficulty accessing drugs through the myriad of administrative processes and drug company reluctance to provide investigational products while newcomers reported administrative hurdles. Oncologists outlined several rationales patients offered when seeking investigational drugs, including those with stronger health literacy and a good scientific rationale versus others who remained skeptical of conventional medicine. Participants reported that most patients had realistic expectations while some had unrealistic optimism. Given the diverse reasons patients sought investigational drugs, four factors—scientific rationale, risk-benefit ratio, functional status of the patient, and patient motivation—influenced oncologists’ decisions to request compassionate use drugs. Physicians struggled with a “right-to-try” framing of patient access to experimental drugs, noting instead their own responsibility to protect patients’ best interest in the uncertain and risky process of off-protocol access. This study highlights the willingness of oncologists at a major cancer center to pursue non-trial access to experimental treatments for patients while also shedding light on the factors they use when considering such treatment.

Methods: We analyzed multiple cell subgroups and their gene expression of peripheral T, B, myeloid, and NK cells from renal allograft recipients with accommodation and healthy control (HC) by single-cell transcriptomics sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. Results: A total of 8,272 cells were isolated and sequenced from three individuals, including 2,758 cells from HC, 2,550 cells from ESRD patient, and 2,964 cells from KTx patient, as well as 396 immune response–related genes were detected during sequencing. 5 T-cell, 4 NK-cell, 5 myeloid, and 4 B-cell clusters were defined.

They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections; looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales; and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population. RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47.08%) and anxiety (27.06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point. There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses.

We located diagnosed HIV infections in Amsterdam using postcode data at time of registration to the cohort, and estimated their date of infection using clinical HIV data. We then inferred the proportion undiagnosed from the estimated times to diagnosis. To determine sources of Amsterdam infections, we used HIV sequences of people living with HIV (PLHIV) within a background of other Dutch and international sequences to phylogenetically reconstruct transmission chains. Frequent late diagnoses indicate that more recent phylogenetically observed chains are increasingly incomplete, and we use a Bayesian model to estimate the actual growth of Amsterdam transmission chains, and the proportion of locally acquired infections. We estimate that 20% [95% CrI 18-22%] of infections acquired among MSM between 2014-2018 were undiagnosed by the start of 2019, and 44% [37-50%] among heterosexuals, with variation by place of birth. The estimated proportion of MSM infections in 2014-2018 that were locally acquired was 68% [61-74%], with no substantial differences by region of birth. In heterosexuals, this was 57% [41-71%] overall, with heterogeneity by place of birth. The data indicate substantial potential to further curb local transmission, in both MSM and heterosexual Amsterdam residents.

However, a standard cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to evaluated the benefits of SDD when performing THA from the perspective of both economic and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Eighty-four participants undergoing primary THA were randomized to either the SDD group or the inpatient group. Outcomes were assessed by an independent orthopedist who was not in the surgical team, using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), SF-36 scores and the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). All the cost information was also collected. RESULTS: The mean stay of patients in the SDD group was 21.70 ± 3.45 h, while the inpatient group was 78.15 ± 26.36 h. This trial did not detect any significant differences in OHS and QALYs. The total cost in the SDD group was significantly lower than that in the inpatient group (¥69,771.27 ± 6,608.00 vs. ¥80,666.17 ± 8,421.96, p < 0.001).

This opens up a whole new research area for energy modelling because although decarbonization pathways have been developed for countries, regions, or communities, few have been developed for industry sectors. In this research, we document the development of energy scenarios for industry sectors classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). A bottom-up energy demand analysis based on market projections for the chemical, aluminium, and steel industries forms the basis for scenario development, with the aim of completely decarbonizing the electricity and process heat supplies for these industries by 2050. We document the individual steps in the energy demand analyses based on industry-specific market projections and energy intensities. In the last step, the carbon budget is calculated.

Significantly, adipocytokines were found to be involved in the physiology of many body functions, including reproduction. The role of body weight, body fat compositions, and nutrition has been largely investigated using animal models and human studies. Malnutrition and/or abnormal body weight may induce disturbances in fertility, puberty, pregnancy, and menstrual cycles. Leptin was the first discovered adipocytokine, and a large body of data over the last 25 years has shown that leptin is not only a molecule that reflects energy stores in the body, but is also an important cytokine involved in many physiological functions, such as inflammatory response, insulin sensitivity, bone metabolism, immunity, and most importantly, reproductive function. Leptin controls the normal physiology of the female reproductive system; it interacts with the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis by a complex mechanism that connects energy homeostasis with reproduction. However, observational studies have demonstrated inconsistent results about leptin variation during normal menstrual cycle, and the mechanisms involved in the interplay between leptin and the hormones of the HPG axis are largely unknown. This review focuses on leptin variation during normal menstrual cycles and its relation to the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, and the effect of overweight/obesity on leptin during menstrual cycle is further reviewed.\\ntitle: Variation of Leptin During Menstrual Cycle and Its Relation to the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Gonadal (HPG) Axis: A Systematic Review', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 905}), Document(page_content='abstract: Despite achievements of modern science and clinical practice, a frequency of complications including fatality are still at a high level in Coronavirus Disease Data on a spectrum of complications of COVID-19 is permanently updated In this article three cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in patients with COVID-19 are analyzed This syndrome itself is a very rare neurological pathology accompanied by frequent disability and the mortality of patients Несмотря на достижения современной науки и клинической практики, частота осложнений, включая и летальные исходы, при новой коронавирусной инфекции остается на высоком уровне Данные о спектре осложнений COVID-19 постоянно обновляются В настоящей статье анализируются три случая развития синдрома Гийена - Баpре (СГБ) у пациентов с COVID-19 Указанный синдром сам по себе является достаточно редкой неврологической формой патологии, сопровождающийся частой инвалидизацией и смертностью пациентов\\ntitle: Complication of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by Guillain-Barré syndrome', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 906}), Document(page_content='abstract: Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy is an autoimmune peripheral-nerve and/or nerve-root disorder known to usually respond to intravenous immunoglobulin-G treatment. Benefit can involve any combination of motor-nerve fibers and large and small sensory-nerve fibers responsible for a progressively crippling, unbalancing, discomforting or painful disorder. \"Diabetic neuropathy\" is commonly considered untreatable. However, 81% of my 48 recently-summarized type-2 diabetes patients with polyneuropathy, adequately-treated with intravenous immunoglobulin-G, off-label, were relieved, sometimes completely, of various motor and sensory symptoms, including pain, thereby resembling Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy. Spinal fluid protein in them is often elevated, higher values seeming to auger a better intravenous immunoglobulin-G response. Continuing the improvement requires continuing the intravenous immunoglobulin-G treatment, indicating both intravenous immunoglobulin-G responsiveness and dependency. The intravenous immunoglobulin-G responsive type-2 diabetes polyneuropathy usually is dysschwannian, sometimes mainly dysneuronal intravenous immunoglobulin-G, the most beneficial and safest treatment, is costly, but if intravenous immunoglobulin-G-treatability of a dysimmune component of type-2 diabetes neuropathy is overlooked, dismissed or rejected, as commonly happens, other costs are high regarding the patient\\'s worsening morbidity and disability, and resultant need for increased medical care. A novel intravenous immunoglobulin-G regimen effective for fragile patients is Two Non-Consecutive-Days Every Week, using 0.4 gm/kg body wt/day. Possible molecular mechanisms of intravenous immunoglobulin-G benefit are discussed. I propose that a) there is a higher incidence of Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy-like neuropathy in type-2 diabetes patients and in patients with a strong family history of type-2 diabetes, and b) the intravenous immunoglobulin-G-treatable neuropathy in type-2 diabetes can be brought on by the genetico-diabetoid-2 state. The genetic-metabolic milieu (but not necessarily glucose dysmetabolism per se.) of type-2 diabetes putatively predisposes to the presumably-dysimmune intravenous immunoglobulin-G-responsive polyneuropathy. In some of our patients, especially ones having a strong type-2 diabetes genetic background, the intravenous immunoglobulin-G-responsive neuropathy preceded the diagnosis of type-2 diabetes by 5-10 years. Accordingly, Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy patients having a strong type-2 diabetes genetic background are designated \"genetico-diabetoid-2 neuropathy\" prior to their manifesting type-2 diabetes.

METHODS Eligible patients included OCTAVE Induction 1&2 non-responders and OCTAVE Sustain completers/treatment failures. Patients in remission at OCTAVE Open baseline received tofacitinib 5 mg b.d.; all others received 10 mg b.d. Incidence rates (unique patients with events/100 patient-years) for adverse events of special interest were calculated; ≤7.0 years of observation. Efficacy endpoints derived from Mayo score were reported ≤36 months (last scheduled endoscopy visit). RESULTS In OCTAVE Open, 769 of 944 patients (81.5%) initially received tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. Among all patients (2440.8 patient-years of exposure), incidence rates (IRs; 95% confidence intervals) for deaths and adverse events of special interest were: deaths, 0.25 (0.09-0.54); serious infections, 1.61 (1.14-2.20); herpes zoster (non-serious and serious), 3.16 (2.47-3.97); opportunistic infections, 0.87 (0.54-1.33); major adverse cardiovascular events, 0.16 (0.04-0.42); malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), 1.03 (0.67-1.52); non-melanoma skin cancer, 0.75 (0.45-1.19); deep vein thrombosis, 0.04 (0.00-0.23); pulmonary embolism, 0.21 (0.07-0.48). At Month 36, 66.9% and 40.3% showed clinical response, 64.6% and 37.1% had endoscopic improvement, and 58.9% and 33.7% maintained or achieved remission, with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg b.d. respectively.

Pregnant women are more at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their weakened immune system. Studies demonstrate that COVID-19 is an immune condition which is marked by reduced lymphocytes and elevated selected proinflammatory cytokines. Similar immune expression has been demonstrated in pregnancy by several studies. In addition, the placenta has been shown to possess ACE2 receptors on the villous cytotrophoblast and the syncytiotrophoblast and findings suggest that the coronavirus enters the host cells via these ACE2 receptors. The immune response in pregnancy increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. Both normal pregnancy and COVID-19 are marked by decreased lymphocytes, NKG2A inhibitory receptors, and increased ACE2, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 it therefore safer to conclude that pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 development. Furthermore, the presence of the ACE2 receptors in the placenta may increase the risk of mother to baby transmission of the virus. Therefore, more studies investigating the link between pregnancy and COVID-19 are needed.\\ntitle: Is pregnancy a risk factor of COVID-19?', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 911}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: The SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) outbreak adversely affected medical school education and drastically reduced in‐person learning, specifically affecting gross anatomy laboratory dissection. Depending on the academic calendar schedule, some schools were interrupted in the middle of anatomy teaching while others had more lead time to prepare but schools suddenly faced an imposed demand for a transition to distance learning. SUNY Downstate had its anatomy education interrupted due to the Covid‐19 shut down. To gap the previous laboratory experience of students and complete the semester anatomy curriculum, a series of dissected abdominal videos were created and distributed to all first‐year medical students (n=208). The video‐based curriculum and the current student experience taking anatomy without cadaveric dissections were assessed via pre/post‐tests and a five‐question survey. A paired single tailed t‐test comparing student responses (n=164) in the pre‐ versus post‐test was statistically significant (P < 0.002) while 92% of students (n=136) reported that their previous time dissecting prepared them to learn through videos without the benefit of hands‐on dissection. Icahn School of Medicine adopted digital Grant's Dissector utilizing their accompanying narrated videos. Faculty voiced over the narration, however, permitting emphasis of material, directing pacing of course, and tying content to lecture and physical exams. Complete anatomy was used to augment the experience, with 3D virtual dissections and enhance the visualization of the structures, however the videos remained as the driver of content delivery. Weill Cornell Medicine created, and customized anatomy prosected material videotaping the show and tell sessions integrating powerpoint slides to tie in lecture content and clinical correlates. Results from all three schools highlight the technical success of implementing an anatomy video‐based curriculum in response to COVID‐19. Survey findings describe a unique cohort of students who were compelled to participate in a video‐based curriculum after having learned anatomy in a donor body laboratory environment and student performance on summative exams in general equaled or exceeded scores from previous years. Overall, anatomy education through videos, digital platforms, and apps can offer a reliable stop‐gap solution in the absence of traditional cadaveric dissection in a short‐term, provisional model. However, the experience of learning anatomy from a human body in laboratory is irreplaceable and the future now seems to point to a combination of these modalities, and others, such as virtual reality or augmented reality, yet to be adapted and customized to our educational settings.\\ntitle: Discovering the Value of Anatomy Laboratory Education During the COVID‐19 Pandemic from The Perspective of Three Medical Schools’ Experience\", metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 912}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: The δ- and λ-variants of COVID-19 are blowing to globle economy, human life and health.

It has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality around the world. The respiratory system is the main system invaded by the virus involved in COVID-19. In addition to typical respiratory manifestations, a certain proportion of severe COVID-19 cases present with evidence of myocardial injury, which is associated with excessive mortality. With availability of an increasing amount of imaging data, right ventricular (RV) damage is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury, while left ventricular damage is relatively rare and lacks specificity. The mechanisms of RV damage may be due to increased RV afterload and decreased RV contractility caused by various factors, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary thrombosis, direct viral injury, hypoxia, inflammatory response and autoimmune injury. RV dysfunction usually indicates a poor clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19. Timely and effective treatment is of vital importance to save patients' lives as well as improve prognosis. By use of echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance, doctors can find RV dilatation and dysfunction early. By illustrating the phenomenon of RV damage and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms, we will guide doctors to give timely medical treatments (e.g., anticoagulants, diuretics, cardiotonic), and device-assisted therapy (e.g., mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) when necessary for these patients.

The goal of this study was to identify trajectories between adult children’s transnational caregiving for their parents and caregivers’ wellness in Japanese Americans before and during the pandemic. We conducted semi-structured interviews with Japanese Americans 40 to 59 years of age (N=20) in California before the lockdown and during the increasing number of patients infected with the Delta variant. The qualitative data analysis showed some Japanese Americans periodically returned to Japan to provide caregiving for their parents before the pandemic, while others didn’t. However, the former group currently relied on their families in their home country more than before. The limitations led to not only distress over uncertainty but also release from a strong sense of reciprocity and filial responsibility, by changing from physical support to emotional and financial support via online. They also enhanced cultural identity as Japanese Americans, by thriving from discrimination against Asian Americans.

Blood mononuclear cell count, LDH, and plasma D-dimer were obtained. To evaluate the utility of biomarker levels in differentiating viral pneumonia from other pneumonia, ROC curves were developed to analyze the AUC. The optimal cut-off thresholds, specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values were assessed using the Youden index. The added value of the multi-marker approach was delineated using IDI and Reclassification analyses using NRI;IDI and NRI values were examined with 95% CI.

Here, we utilize integrative analysis of a baboon diurnal transcriptome atlas to characterize the properties of gene networks under circadian control. We found that 53.4% (8,120) of baboon genes are rhythmically expressed body-wide. In addition, >30% of gene-gene interactions exhibit periodic co-expression patterns, with core circadian genes more cyclically co-expressed than others. Moreover, two basic network modes were observed at the systems level: daytime and nighttime mode. Daytime networks were enriched for genes involved in metabolism, while nighttime networks were enriched for genes associated with growth and cellular signaling. A substantial number of diseases only form significant disease modules at either daytime or nighttime. In addition, we found that 216 of 313 genes encoding products that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are rhythmically expressed throughout the body. Importantly, more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 related genes enriched modules are rhythmically expressed, and have significant network proximities with circadian regulators.

Materials and Methods: Population health survey (2010–2018) data were used to characterize dietary habits in women of reproductive age. Additionally, 129 pregnant women in the first trimester were recruited; they completed a questionnaire and were tested for thyroid function, urinary iodine concentration (UIC), and serum selenium and selenoprotein P levels. Results: The use of some dietary sources of iodine (e.g., milk and dairy products) and selenium (e.g., bread) has decreased in recent years. Less than 10% of respondents reported the use of iodized salt. The use of supplements has become more common (reported by almost 50% of respondents in 2018). Dietary habits were similar in pregnant women, but the use of supplements was even higher (almost 70%). Nevertheless, most supplements used in pregnancy had insufficient contents of iodine and selenium. Thyroid function was euthyreotic in all women, but 13.9% of participants had a thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) level above 60 IU/mL.

Other factors that played a significant role for student success were faculty empathy, flexibility, and willingness to adjust teaching strategies. All students who completed the courses (without withdrawing) earned grades of C or better. Over a total of 12 physics class sections, grade distributions in Fall 2020 were better than those of Fall 2019. Only a handful of students received incomplete grades because they were directly or indirectly affected by the COVID virus.

Given that, it is important for the Emergency Physician to remember that a SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory failure can be caused not only by the pulmonary parenchymal inflammation that characterizes the pneumonia, but also by an associated pulmonary thromboembolism. Case report: A healthy 73-years old woman admitted to the ED for dyspnea, fever and thoracic pain. Cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiogram and clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of cardiogenic obstructive shock due to acute pulmonary embolism, successfully treated with thrombolysis. A CT angiography confirmed the pulmonary embolism (EP) diagnosis and showed bilateral pneumonia, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The proportion of people who reduced their physical activity was greater among those who were very active than those who were active (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 0.65 [confidence interval (CI): 0.52–0.80]) or insufficiently active [aPR: 0.39 (0.18–0.82)]. The proportion of people who reduced their physical activity was greater among those who received a salary less than minimum wage (MW) than those who received a salary between three to six times minimum wage [(aPR: 0.50 (CI 0.35–0.70)] or more than 6 MW [(aPR: 0.56 (CI 0.40–0.79)]. Conclusions: A higher prevalence of Brazilians residing in the city of São Paulo reduced their physical activity who had a vigorous level of physical activity prior to the pandemic and who received less than a MW.\\ntitle: Factors Associated with Reduction in Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic in São Paulo, Brazil: An Internet-Based Survey Conducted in June 2020', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 924}), Document(page_content='abstract: Objective The outbreak of COVID-19 in South Kivu (DRC) raised the fear of added morbidity and mortality. Updating these indicators before a second wave seems essential to prepare for additional help. Methods From mid-May to mid-December 2020, weekly surveys in sampled streets from ten Health Areas quantified the application of barrier measures and analyzed questionnaires about sickness and death cases in interviewees’ households. Crude death rates (CDRs) were estimated. Results Little or no masking was observed in at least half of the streets. From May to December, the number of people presumably sick with Covid-19 increased sixfold (p < 0.05). Within 30 days before the interviews, 20% of deaths were presumably due to COVID-19. The monthly CDR at the beginning and end of the study were respectively close to 5 and 25 per 1000 people (p < 0.05); that is, annual CDRs of 60 and 260 per 1000, respectively. Thus, during the first epidemic wave, the estimated mortality rate increased by 50% vs. previous years and, by the end of 2020, it would have increased fourfold or more. Conclusion Despite possible overestimations, the excess mortality in South Kivu is extremely concerning.

Improvement in diagnostic testing is an area of current research. During diagnostic evaluation of PCD we observed ciliated conical protrusions from part of the apical surface of ciliated cells in those diagnosed with PCD. The aim of this study was to investigate if this abnormality was specific to PCD. METHODS: Epithelial edges from 67 consecutively diagnosed PCD patients, 67 patients consecutively referred for PCD diagnostic testing in whom PCD was excluded, 22 with asthma and 18 with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) were studied retrospectively in a blinded manner using light microscopy. RESULTS: Forty six out of 67 patients with PCD had ciliated conical epithelial protrusions, whereas none were seen in patients where PCD was excluded, or in patients with asthma or CF. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the presence of the ciliated conical protrusions to predict a diagnosis of PCD were 76.5, 100, 100 and 77% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristic ciliated conical protrusions from ciliated epithelial cells maybe a useful pointer to the diagnosis of PCD. However, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of PCD.

METHOD: SGMY (n = 138; M age = 22.44) were allocated to immediate 8-week AFFIRM intervention delivered at 12 community-based organisations or an 8-week waitlisted control. At baseline, post-intervention or post-waitlist, participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, hope, coping, and stress appraisal. Implementation outcomes of feasibility and acceptability were also assessed. RESULTS: Compared to waitlist, SGMY in the intervention condition significantly reduced their depressive symptoms (b = − 5.79, p = .001) as well as increased reports of hope (agency: b = 0.84, p = .001; pathway: b = 0.79, p = .001), and coping by emotional support (b = 0.59, p < .001), instrumental support (b = 0.67, p < .001), positive framing (b = 0.59, p < .001), humour (b = 0.36, p = .014), planning (b = 0.49, p < .001) as well as reflective coping (b = 0.27, p = .009). Intervention participants were also less likely to perceive stress as a threat (b = − 0.43, p = .001), and more likely to perceive stress as challenge (b = 0.67, p < .001) and have the resources to deal with that stress (b = 0.38, p = .016) in comparison to waitlisted control participants. All outcomes had medium to large effect sizes. AFFIRM participants reported low attrition (8.5%) and high levels of engagement and acceptability (e.g. 99% agreed intervention was relevant to their lives). Over 63% of the community organizations that participated in the training hosted AFFIRM at least once during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate efficacy for the community-based implementation of an affirmative clinical intervention designed for SGMY to address depression and foster coping with universal and minority stressors.

The nasopharyngeal region could be a potent carrier of long-term bioaerosol exposure agents. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of swine workers and the swine barns bioaerosol biodiversity. Methods: Air samples from eight swine barns as well as nasopharyngeal swabs from pig workers (n = 25) and from a non-exposed control group (n = 29) were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Wastewater treatment plants were used as the industrial, low-dust, non-agricultural environment control to validate the microbial link between the bioaerosol content (air) and the nasopharynxes of workers. Results: A multivariate analysis showed air samples and nasopharyngeal flora of pig workers cluster together, compared to the non-exposed control group. The significance was confirmed with the PERMANOVA statistical test (p-value of 0.0001). Unlike the farm environment, nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers did not cluster with air samples from wastewater treatment plants. The difference in the microbial community of nasopharynx of swine workers and a control group suggest that swine workers are carriers of germs found in bioaerosols.

Methods: • A/R information sheet outlining reason for using FGMS and sharing data agreement via Libre View. • Video consultation with Dietitian/CF Diabetes Nurse to discuss and support insertion of Libre sensor and link to sharing data. • Patients completed 2 weeks of daily scanning and food diary. • 2 weekly CFRD MDT data analysis, using the Brompton CGM criteria for CFRD diagnosis (see table 1). [Table presented] Results: • Good uptake of CFRD screening process. • 13 patients screened with FGMS (see table 2). • Monitoring of glucose against timely food diary, using Libre View App. • FGMS has identified patients with impaired glucose handling that may have been missed on OGTT. • Patients able to observe effect of food on blood glucose levels. [Table presented] Conclusion: Using the FGMS has enhanced patient's compliance with A/R screening for CFRD. The FGMS has identified early diagnosis of patients with CFRD and patients with delayed insulin response leading to effective insulin treatment and appropriate dietary changes. Feedback to the patient following A/R has been quicker and more efficient due to video consultations and the sharing of glucose results and food diary via the App and Libre View sharing agreement.

The total trial consisted of 16 clusters randomized into 8 intervention and 8 control clusters to assess the impact of an mCDMSS on neonatal mortality in Ghana. We evaluated health workers' adherence (expressed as percentages) to birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice and cord sepsis protocols by reviewing medical records of neonatal in-patients using a checklist. Differences in adherence to neonatal health protocols within and between the study arms were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and permutation tests for each morbidity type. In addition, we tracked concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the clusters during the 18-month intervention period. RESULTS: In the intervention arm, mean adherence was 35.2% (SD = 5.8%) and 43.6% (SD = 27.5%) for asphyxia; 25.0% (SD = 14.8%) and 39.3% (SD = 27.7%) for jaundice; 52.0% (SD = 11.0%) and 75.0% (SD = 21.2%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. In the control arm, mean adherence was 52.9% (SD = 16.4%) and 74.5% (SD = 14.7%) for asphyxia; 45.1% (SD = 12.8%) and 64.6% (SD = 8.2%) for jaundice; 53.8% (SD = 16.0%) and 60.8% (SD = 11.7%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively.

First, there are some gaps and defects in the labor and social security laws in terms of their scope and applicability to flexible workers. Second, there were limitations in the support and protection policies for flexible workers at the early stages of the pandemic. Although the government implemented measures soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, their role is still constrained by the legal lacunae in protecting flexible workers. As flexible employment will continue to play a significant role in China's labor market, the State Council issued a far-reaching official document in July 28, 2020 to support it. This document indicates the directions for providing better legal protection for flexible workers, which contains expanding the legal scope and enriching the legal protection.

At that time, the conventional medical system was grappling to cope with the rapidly spreading pandemic. The potential of Ayurveda, one of the branches of traditional Indian medicine (TIM), with a 5000 year old history, employing medicines derived from plants and other natural sources, against COVID-19 has been explored through a comparative retrospective open-label study. Methods: Reported here are the remedial effects of Ayurvedic medicines alone or in combination with Allopathic treatment on 59 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients, across multiple COVID-19 care centers in Ahmedabad, India. The patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection through RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. With informed consents from the patients, the sourced data was divided into 'Allopathic and Ayurvedic' [AlloAyur] (n = 41) and 'Ayurvedic only'[Ayur] (n = 18) groups, based on the type of treatment the patients decided to receive, that is Ayurvedic medicines with Allopathic treatment or Ayurvedic medicines alone, respectively. Ayurvedic medicines included oral doses and nasal drops; the dosage and regime were decided based on the recommendations from Ayurvedic texts. The Allopathic medicines included Azithromycin, Vitamin-C and anti-histamines. Acetaminophen was also administered when necessary, by the attending physician. The patients were observed for symptomatic improvement. Results: Primary outcome of this study was the symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Data collected over a period of two months, showed that more patients exhibited symptomatic relief in Ayur goup (83.33%) than in the AlloAyur group (48.78%) within the first 13 days of treatment. No visible adverse effects were observed. This indicated faster and safe symptomatic resolution among those treated with Ayurvedic medicines alone.

Due to the high risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), it is associated with prolonged infusion times. These lengthy administrations can limit clinic capacity, require split dose infusions, increase chair time, decrease patient satisfaction, and create access barriers in the era of COVID-19. Recently, a fixed-dose subcutaneous (SC) formulation of daratumumab was approved for the treatment of MM, and the safety-run in results (N=28 patients) from a phase III, randomized trial in AL amyloidosis using the SC formulation were published. The SC formulation has the potential to mitigate some of the setbacks from IV formulation and help improve efficiency in the era of COVID-19, where most clinics are faced with limiting and spreading out volume due to space constraints and social distancing requirements. We present real world evidence from a large academic center's experience with adoption of SC formulation to help overcome current challenges. Methods We prospectively reviewed all patients being treated with IV daratumumab for MM and/or AL amyloidosis at Boston Medical Center Health System (a 500+ bed integrated delivery network) that would be candidates for the SC formulation. A protocol was designed to switch patients that were currently on IV daratumumab as well as patients newly initiating daratumumab to the SC formulation. Patients deemed eligible were switched to the SC formulation under pharmacy benefit (pending insurance authorization by a pharmacy liaison) at their next scheduled infusion visit. Rationale for switching patients to pharmacy benefit was to support home administration during future surge from COVID-19, using our specialty pharmacy travel RN program. Patients that were naïve to daratumumab, started their first dose as a SC injection. Patients were monitored for 30 minutes following the first SC dose and were pre-medicated with oral acetaminophen, dexamethasone, and diphenhydramine. Patient and nursing satisfaction were assessed after switching to SC daratumumab, using internally developed surveys. Using wholesale acquisition cost, cost analysis was performed between the two formulations. Infusion chair time, improvement in clinic efficiency (using our standard infusion time of 90 minutes for IV daratumumab infusions after the 2nd dose), and safety were assessed and compared. Results A total of 26 patients were treated with daratumumab for MM and AL amyloidosis from June 1, 2020 to August 1, 2020. 85% (22/26) of patients were administered the SC formulation. Of these 22 patients, 68% of patients were switched from the IV formulation (15/22) and 32% (7/22) were naïve to daratumumab. The majority (14/22) of SC administrations were patients receiving daratumumab monotherapy for relapsed MM. A breakdown of patient regimens and insurance type is seen in table 1. IRRs were reported in 0 patients starting [or transitioning to] SC daratumumab. Injection site reactions were not reported in any patient. One patient had facial and neck swelling 2 days after administration of SC daratumumab (with no other symptoms) but resolved within 24 hours of an additional dose of dexamethasone and did not recur upon re-challenge of SC daratumumab. Severe neutropenia (ANC less than 500) was reported in 9% of patients (2/22), both patients in the group naïve to daratumumab. Febrile neutropenia was not seen. One patient was being treated with concomitant pomalidomide and the second was treated with lenalidomide and had a baseline ANC of 500 prior to initiation of therapy. Adoption of SC daratumumab led to elimination of 133 hours of chair time and nursing time, or 1260 hours annualized for the year. Cost savings with the elimination of nursing time translates to approximately $100,000 to the institution and approximately $230,000 to the payer. The results compiled from patient and nursing satisfaction surveys are being analyzed and will be presented. Conclusion We report a successful conversion and adoption of SC daratumumab at our ambulatory hematology/oncology clinic. Insurance authorization does not appear to limit the adoption of this therapy in clinic irrespective of diagnosis or regimen used. Furthermore, the reduction in chair time and patient convenience was largely beneficial in light of COVID-19 to minimize patient exposure in clinic.

The PVP-SD model is represented with five classes-based ODEs systems for the interaction between insects and plants. The nonlinear PVP-SD model governs with five populations: S(t) susceptible plants, I(t) infected plants, X(t) susceptible insect vectors, Y(t) infected insect vectors and P(t) predators. Adams numerical procedure is adopted to generate the reference solutions of the nonlinear PVP-SD model based on the variety of cases by varying the plants bite rate due to vectors, vector bite rate due to plants, plant’s recovery rate, predator contact rate with healthy insects, predator contact rate with infected insects and death rate caused by insecticides. The approximate solutions of the nonlinear PVP-SD model are determined by executing the designed NNs-BBRS through different target and inputs arbitrary selected samples for the training and testing data. Validation of the consistent precision and convergence of the designed NNs-BBRS is efficaciously substantiated through exhaustive simulations and analyses on mean square error-based merit function, index of regression and error histogram illustrations.\\ntitle: Artificial intelligence knacks-based stochastic paradigm to study the dynamics of plant virus propagation model with impact of seasonality and delays', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 943}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Data for frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited and whether personal protective equipment (PPE) mitigates this risk is unknown. We evaluated risk for COVID-19 among frontline HCWs compared to the general community and the influence of PPE. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of the general community, including frontline HCWs, who reported information through the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application beginning on March 24 (United Kingdom, U.K.) and March 29 (United States, U.S.) through April 23, 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive COVID-19 test. FINDINGS: Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34,435,272 person-days. Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 11·6 (95% CI: 10·9 to 12·3) for reporting a positive test. The corresponding aHR was 3·40 (95% CI: 3·37 to 3·43) using an inverse probability weighted Cox model adjusting for the likelihood of receiving a test. A symptom-based classifier of predicted COVID-19 yielded similar risk estimates. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE, the aHRs for reporting a positive test were 1·46 (95% CI: 1·21 to 1·76) for those reporting PPE reuse and 1·31 (95% CI: 1·10 to 1·56) for reporting inadequate PPE. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE who did not care for COVID-19 patients, HCWs caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had aHRs for a positive test of 4·83 (95% CI: 3·99 to 5·85) if they had adequate PPE, 5·06 (95% CI: 3·90 to 6·57) for reused PPE, and 5·91 (95% CI: 4·53 to 7·71) for inadequate PPE. INTERPRETATION: Frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 infection, highest among HCWs who reused PPE or had inadequate access to PPE. However, adequate supplies of PPE did not completely mitigate high-risk exposures.

However, hemorrhagic complications occur frequently during ECMO support, and this has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Thus, this study aimed to identify the risk factors for hemorrhage in patients receiving ECMO. Methods: Our retrospective study included 60 patients, who were admitted to the Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China from February 2017 to October 2020. About 18 patients developed hemorrhagic complications, and 42 patients did not demonstrate such complications. Data regarding patient demography, laboratory tests, and clinical manifestations prior to ECMO were collected to analyze their clinical features. Univariable and multivariable logistic analyses were used to explore the risk factors for hemorrhage in adults on ECMO. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the binary logistic model. The amount of blood transfusions was compared between the two groups, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet count, and hemoglobin level before the initiation of ECMO. Results: Logistic analysis showed that a longer duration of ECMO support, higher APTT, and lower platelet count prior to ECMO were independent risk factors for hemorrhage in adults on ECMO. In addition, we found that the cannula site was the most common bleeding site. Most bleeding events occurred within the first 3 days of ECMO therapy. After the ECMO initiation, APTT was prolonged while the platelet count and hemoglobin levels were decreased. The amount of blood transfusion was significantly higher in the hemorrhage group than in the non-hemorrhage group. Conclusions: Clinicians should evaluate the risk of hemorrhage based on the coagulation function of patients, underlying disease, and the duration of ECMO support. In the first 3 days during ECMO support, special attention should be given to the cannula site, mucosal, and dermal regions, and digestive tract to detect any signs of hemorrhage. Moreover, increasing the platelet count transfusion threshold and accurately determining the amount of blood transfusion required may prevent bleeding events.\\ntitle: Clinical Features and Risk Factors Analysis for Hemorrhage in Adults on ECMO', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 947}), Document(page_content='abstract: This article was migrated.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective antiviral agent. To date, considerable research has been conducted to develop different approaches to COVID-19 therapy. In addition to early observational studies, which could be limited by study design, small sample size, non-randomized design, or different timings of treatment, an increasing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of antiviral agents are being carried out. This study reviews the updated findings of RCTs regarding the clinical efficacy of eight antiviral agents against COVID-19, including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, darunavir/cobicistat, and their combinations. Treatment with remdesivir could accelerate clinical improvement; however, it lacked additional survival benefits. Moreover, 5-day regimen of remdesivir might show adequate effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Favipiravir was only marginally effective regarding clinical improvement and virological assessment based on the results of small RCTs. The present evidence suggests that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. However, the sample sizes for analysis were relatively small, and all studies were exclusively conducted in Iran. Further larger RCTs in other countries are warranted to support these findings. In contrast, the present findings of limited RCTs did not indicate the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, and darunavir/cobicistat in the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\\ntitle: Clinical efficacy of antiviral agents against coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 952}), Document(page_content='abstract: Parental empowerment has been related to their well-being and self-efficacy.

The study is based on self-report surveys administered to parents in primary health care and hospital settings. The risk of CM and related worrying factors were measured by the Brief Child Abuse Potential Inventory (BCAP) from 453 parents. Family empowerment was measured by The Generic Family Empowerment Scale (G-FES). Parents expressed worries such as loneliness and distress (20%), feelings of persecution (9%), family conflict (17%), rigidity (21%) and financial insecurity (4%). The BCAP found 27 parents with increased risk. Parents with CM risk expressed more empowerment in connection to services for their child and family. It is crucial to discuss worries in child and family services before they raise the risk level. Tools such as the BCAP are useful in systematically identifying the child maltreatment risk and parental worries under discussion, offering possibilities for preventing child maltreatment and increasing well-being of children.\\ntitle: Parental Worries, Child Maltreatment Risk and Empowerment: How Are They Noticed in Child and Family Services?', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 953}), Document(page_content='abstract: Attenuated DNA repair leads to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy.\\ntitle: L ARP7 Is a BRCA1 Ubiquitinase Substrate and Regulates Genome Stability and Tumorigenesis.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 954}), Document(page_content='abstract: Null.\\ntitle: Experience with Hemodialysis Patients in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sakarya, Turkey.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 955}), Document(page_content='abstract: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract illnesses.

Using various measures of occupational risks based on European Union labor force survey data, we find that immigrant workers, especially those from lower‐income member countries in Eastern Europe or from outside the EU, face greater exposure than their native‐born peers to both income and health‐shocks related to COVID‐19. We also show that native workers living in regions with a higher concentration of immigrants are less exposed to some of the income and health risks associated with the pandemic. To assess whether this relationship is causal, we use a Bartik‐type shift‐share instrument to control for potential bias and unobservable factors that would lead migrants to self‐select into more vulnerable occupations across regions. The results show that the presence of immigrant workers has a causal effect in reducing the exposure of native workers to various risks by enabling the native‐born workers to move into jobs that could be undertaken from the safety of their homes or with lower face‐to‐face interactions. The effects on the native‐born population are more pronounced for high‐skilled workers than for low‐skilled workers, and for women than for men.

This methodology was transferred to research institutes, public hospitals and academic laboratories all around the country, creating a COVID-19 diagnostic lab network. Uruguay also implemented active epidemiological surveillance following the Test, Trace and Isolate (TETRIS) strategy coupled to real-time genomic epidemiology. Results: Three months after the first cases were detected, the number of positive individuals reached 826 (23 deaths, 112 active cases and 691 recovered). The Uruguayan strategy was based in a close synergy established between the national health authorities and the scientific community. In turn, academia rapidly responded to develop national RT-qPCR tests. Consequently, Uruguay was able to perform ~1,000 molecular tests per day in a matter of weeks. The COVID-19 diagnostic lab network performed more than 54% of the molecular tests in the country.

However, whether SGLT2 inhibitors affect the tissue characteristics of the human arterial wall remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tofogliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, on the tissue characteristics of the human arterial wall in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without apparent cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS The present study was a post hoc analysis based on data obtained from the Using Tofogliflozin for Possible Better Intervention against Atherosclerosis for Type 2 Diabetes Patients (UTOPIA) trial, which was a multicenter prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tofogliflozin in preventing the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. We evaluated the longitudinal change in the ultrasonic tissue characteristics of the carotid wall using gray-scale median (GSM), an established index of ultrasonic tissue characteristics. The right and left intima-medial areas were delineated, and the GSM values were evaluated (right GSM-CCA and left GSM-CCA). The average values of the right and left carotid arteries were defined as \"mean GSM-CCA value.\" RESULTS In a mixed-effects model for repeated measures, mean GSM-CCA, along with the right and left GSM-CCA values, did not significantly change in either the tofogliflozin (n = 168) or conventional treatment group (n = 169). In addition, the tofogliflozin and conventional treatment groups did not significantly differ regarding the change of the mean GSM-CCA (mean difference [95% CI] - 1.24[- 3.87, 1.38], P = 0.35), along with the right (mean difference [95% CI] - 2.33[- 5.70, 1.05], P = 0.18) and the left GSM-CCA (mean difference [95% CI] - 0.29 [- 3.53, 2.95], P = 0.86) values. Similar findings were obtained even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and/or the administration of drugs at baseline. CONCLUSIONS The tissue characteristics of the carotid arterial wall did not change in either the tofogliflozin or conventional treatment group during the 104-week treatment period, and there was no significant difference between the treatment groups.

We aim to evaluate the economic and healthcare impact of lung perfusion scintigraphy (LPS) used in patients with suspected APE, in the event of non-conclusive or contraindicated computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We considered two alternative healthcare processes for APE diagnosis, with and without LPS. We performed a cost analysis with the aim of evaluating the average direct healthcare costs for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of APE. We used data from a monocentric trial. Our economic model showed that the strategy with LPS was preferable in terms of costs. The average per-patient costs for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute phase of PE in low-risk patients with a non-conclusive or not-executable CTPA, with and without LPS, are EUR 2145.25 and EUR 4912.45, respectively. LPS is a simple, quick, and economic examination, useful in this setting of patients not only for an early diagnosis but also to exclude APE, demonstrating an advantage in terms of healthcare resources. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the economic and healthcare impact of the use of LPS in the diagnostic pathway of suspected APE.\\ntitle: Healthcare and Economic Impact of Lung Perfusion Scintigraphy in Patients Affected by Acute Pulmonary Embolism', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 967}), Document(page_content='abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide new insight into the modern slavery threat and to enhance its detection in supply chains by understanding and addressing barriers to whistleblowing A broad definition of a whistle-blower is adopted, which includes any witness internal or external to an organisation Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper that includes using news reports and other secondary data sources on a recent modern slavery scandal in garment factories in Leicester, UK and the lens of the bystander effect from the social psychology literature The core focus is on whistleblowing by members of the local community in which an operation or supply chain is embedded Findings: The phenomenon of modern slavery being an “open secret” within the local community is highlighted But rather than the case being characterised by widespread whistleblowing, the problem only came into full focus when poor working conditions and forced labour during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions contributed to the spread of the virus It is argued that overcoming this “bystander effect” can lead to the greater mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing Research limitations/implications: Two sets of propositions and a conceptual model are provided and seven future research suggestions are outlined, including extending the present study to whistleblowing by victims and other internal members of an organisation or supply chain Practical implications: If it can be mobilised, then whistleblowing has the potential to be an important part of detecting modern slavery, either temporarily replacing audits where they are not possible due to social distancing restrictions or directing the use of limited auditing resources to high-risk factories In this way, combinations of practices can be effectively used to tackle the threat Social implications: This contributes to addressing an important societal problem and one of the grandest challenges facing modern-day supply chains This, it has been argued, is an even bigger problem now than ever before given the economic and market conditions created by the COVID-19 global pandemic Originality/value: This is the first paper to focus on operationalising the practice of whistleblowing as a source of greater supply chain intelligence to aid modern slavery detection Causes of the bystander effect include the perceived low-emergency threat of modern slavery, the high-ambiguity environment, a low bystander responsibility and low assistance/intervention incentive Countermeasures include elevating the emergency status of modern slavery, creating a shared sense of responsibility for tackling the problem, having clear reporting channels and taking swift and consistent action when instances of modern slavery are detected © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited\\ntitle: Hidden in plain sight: the bystander effect and the mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 968}), Document(page_content=\"abstract: OBJECTIVE to reflect on the psychosocial risks and their impacts on the health of health workers in light of the Brazilian economic context and Labor Reform.

Despite this increase in testing, many pediatric hematology–oncology (PHO) providers are not confident interpreting or utilizing tumor or germline genomic results to care for their patients. METHODS: We developed and delivered a needs assessment survey to PHO program directors, attendings, and fellows in the United States to understand this deficiency, gather data on existing cancer genomics educational initiatives, and query preferences for creating a future curriculum. RESULTS: The survey includes 31 (41%) of 74 invited PHO program directors, 110 (11%) of 1032 invited attendings, and 79 fellows. The majority of attending physicians and fellows responding to the survey agree that understanding tumor (95% attending physicians; 95% fellows) and germline (86% attending physicians; 94% fellows) genomic information is essential for their practice. However, only 9 of 31 (29%) responding programs report that they have an existing cancer genomics curriculum. Most program directors indicated that the ideal genomics curriculum would occur during the first year of fellowship and incorporate direct patient care, online modules, and problem‐based learning. Attending physicians and fellows identified that addressing indications for ordering tumor and germline genomic testing, counseling about the risks and benefits of such testing, and interpreting and individualizing clinical management based on tumor and germline results should be included in a future curriculum.

CT is a heterohexameric protein complex with a 240-residue A subunit and a pentameric B subunit of identical 103-residue B polypeptides. The A subunit is proteolytically cleaved within a disulfide-linked loop to generate the A1 and A2 fragments. The B subunit of wild-type (wt) CT binds 5 cell surface ganglioside GM(1) (GM(1)) molecules, and the toxin-GM(1) complex traffics from the plasma membrane (PM) retrograde through endosomes and the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, the enzymatic A1 fragment retrotranslocates to the cytosol to cause disease. Clustering of GM(1) by multivalent toxin binding can structurally remodel cell membranes in ways that may assist toxin uptake and retrograde trafficking. We have recently found, however, that CT may traffic from the PM to the ER by exploiting an endogenous glycosphingolipid pathway (A. A. Wolf et al., Infect. Immun. 76:1476–1484, 2008, and D. J. F. Chinnapen et al., Dev. Cell 23:573–586, 2012), suggesting that multivalent binding to GM(1) is dispensable. Here we formally tested this idea by creating homogenous chimeric holotoxins with defined numbers of native GM(1) binding sites from zero (nonbinding) to five (wild type). We found that a single GM(1) binding site is sufficient for activity of the holotoxin. Therefore, remodeling of cell membranes by mechanisms that involve multivalent binding of toxin to GM(1) receptors is not essential for toxicity of CT.\\ntitle: A Single Native Ganglioside GM(1)-Binding Site Is Sufficient for Cholera Toxin To Bind to Cells and Complete the Intoxication Pathway', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 973}), Document(page_content='abstract: Between 10 May and 10 June 2020, the author conducted a mixed online survey amongst Venezuelan refugees and migrants currently living in Trinidad and Tobago, to assess the impact of local COVID-19 measures on their livelihoods and food security.

Most often, local corticosteroids are used to treat these processes, although their use requires caution due to the risk of activating secondary infection (herpetic bacterial, fungal), which often develops as a result of immunodeficiency caused both by COVID-19 and the massive corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy employed when the course of the disease is severe.

We outline our deployment of a virtual tabletop simulation (TTS) method in primary care (PC) clinics across Alberta, Canada. We summarise the quality and safety improvements from this method and report end users' perspectives on key elements. Methods: Our virtual TTS used teleconferencing software alongside digital whiteboards to walk clinic stakeholders through patient scenarios. Participants reviewed and rehearsed their workflows and care practices. The goal was for staff to take ownership over gaps and codesigned solutions. After simulation sessions, follow-up interviews were conducted to collect feedback. Results: These sessions helped PC staff identify and codesign solutions for clinical hazards and threats. These included the flow of patients through clinics, communications, redesignation of physical spaces, and adaptation of guidance for cleaning and personal protective equipment use. End users reported sessions provided neutral spaces to discuss practice changes and built confidence in delivering safe care during the pandemic. Discussion: TTS has not been extensively deployed to improve clinical practice in outpatient environments. We show how virtual TTS can bridge gaps between knowledge and practice by offering a guided space to rehearse clinical changes. We show that virtual TTS can be used in multiple contexts to help identify hazards, improve safety and build confidence in professional teams adapting to rapid changes in both policies and practices. While our sessions were conducted in Alberta, our results suggest this method may be deployed in other contexts, including low-resource settings. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

METHODS: The target population was all Iranian people aged 6 years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28 314 people from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias and sampling design. RESULTS: Of the 28 314 Iranians selected, 11 256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until 20 August 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval 13.3%–15.2%), which was equal to 11 958 346 (95% CI 11 211 011–12 746 776) individuals.

We report the thermodynamics of conformational changes in mutant spike protein with respect to the wildtype from the distributions of the dihedral angles obtained from the equilibrium configurations generated via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the mutation causes the increase in distance between N-terminal domain and receptor binding domain leading to an obtuse angle cosine θ distribution in the trimeric structure in spike protein. Thus, increase in open-state is conferred to the more infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2. The thermodynamically destabilized and disordered residues of receptor binding motif among the mutant variants of spike protein are proposed to serve as better binding sites for host factor.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study employed a projective quantitative research design. SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis was used to map ARS internal competencies towards external contexts, and potential opportunities and risks in the robotic market. The ARS purchase and procedural costs were evaluated in two different scenarios. RESULTS: In the first scenario, setting the purchase cost of the Avatera at around $1.3–1.5 million, a total $400 procedural cost reduction compared to the RAS performed with the da Vinci Xi can be calculated. In the second scenario, with a purchase cos of the ARS of $700.000–800.000 and considering a 5-year period with an annual ARS volume of 500 procedures, only an additional $300 will be attributed to the robot itself. Our projections revealed that for an effective competition the purchase cost of ARS should range between $700.000 and $800.000 during the initial phase of market entry. The marketing strategy of the ARS should be oriented towards countries without any robotic system in operational use, followed by countries where the competition intensity in the marketplace is low.

Hospitalized children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as hypoxia or tachypnea) were randomly assigned to receive either 2 units (or pediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care (P+S), versus standard care alone (S), and were followed for 28 days. The primary endpoint was time to normalization of patients’ respiratory status (respiratory rate of ≤ 20 for adults or age defined thresholds of 20–38 for children), and a room air saturation of oxygen ≥ 93%.

Early studies have yielded scoring rubrics focused heavily on hospitalized populations including the critically ill. Operator characteristics of this novel technology in non-critically ill, ambulatory COVID patients has not been described and is an important consideration for dissemination. The purpose of our study was to determine to the inter-rater reliability of an L-POCUS scoring rubric in a population of non-oxygen dependent patients. Methods: This was a cross sectional study design of patients at three academic institutions in the Northeast, Midwest, and West. We included subjects with respiratory complaints who tested positive for COVID-19 and maintained oxygen saturation ≥92% for two hours after presentation to the emergency department as part of a larger project focused on describing L-POCUS prognostic characteristics in a non-critically ill COVID pneumonia population. L-POCUS was performed on seven lung windows on each side of the chest: two anterior, two lateral, and three posterior. All clips were obtained with a curvilinear probe or a linear probe using machine settings to enhance lung findings (\"nerve\" or \"lung\"). The scoring rubric ranged from 0 to 6 for each lung field with 0 being normal lung and 6 indicating severe lung pathology from COVID. We divided lung findings into pleural and parenchymal with the score per lung field representing the sum of the two parts. Pleural findings included normal (0 points), blurring, indenting, or thickening (1 point), and discontinuity (2 points). Parenchymal findings included normal (0 points), B lines (1-3 B lines equaled 1 point, &gt;3 B lines equaled 2 points, coalescing or “waterfall” B lines equaled 3 points), and subpleural consolidation (4 points). As discontinuous pleura necessarily accompanies subpleural consolidations per definition, lung fields with subpleural consolidations automatically scored 6 points. Clips, collected and scored at bedside by an expert sonologist, were randomly selected for scoring by other operators of differing experiences: a resident, a faculty member without ultrasound fellowship training, an ultrasound fellow, and a second expert. Scores were then analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using the R package “ICC” to determine inter-rater reliability between the initial expert rater and all other raters. Results: A total of 50 clips lasting 6 seconds each were chosen for scoring, 49 with the culvilinear probe and 1 with the linear probe. The calculated Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for expert raters was 0.71 (0.55, 0.83, p&lt;0.0001) 0.83). Moderate agreement between all raters was found with an ICC of 0.72 (0.62, 0.81). The faculty member without ultrasound fellowship training and the fellow disagreed the most from the group and resulted in the highest variability. A Loess graph demonstrates less variability at low scores than high scores. Conclusion: The L-POCUS rubric for scoring lungs infected with COVID in an ambulatory population revealed moderate to good agreement among a diverse group of operators. Greater variation at higher scores reveals ambiguity in definitions of lung pathology in COVID. This warrants future studies refining criteria for lung findings and correlating to clinical implications.

Despite previous data suggestive of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in urine, we were unable to identify any traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in our group. Both COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, OR = 23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89–67.57, P < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) history (OR = 7.17, CI 2.09–24.47, P = 0.002) were associated with the AKI rate. SUMMARY: AKI is a relatively frequent condition for patients with COVID-19 and is normally correlated with the severity of the disease and the patient's history of CKD. The available data fail to address whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is present in urine, whereas our prospective trial data suggest that mRNA is undetectable in urine irrespective of the severity of the disease.\\ntitle: Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: are kidneys the target or just collateral damage?

We report the complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of an isolate (BJ01) of the coronavirus that has been recognized as a pathogen for SARS. The genome is 29725 nt in size and has 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames). It is composed of a stable region encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (composed of 2 ORFs) and a variable region representing 4 CDSs (coding sequences) for viral structural genes (the S, E, M, N proteins) and 5 PUPs (putative uncharacterized proteins). Its gene order is identical to that of other known coronaviruses. The sequence alignment with all known RNA viruses places this virus as a member in the family of Coronaviridae. Thirty putative substitutions have been identified by comparative analysis of the 5 SARS-associated virus genome sequences in GenBank. Fifteen of them lead to possible amino acid changes (non-synonymous mutations) in the proteins. Three amino acid changes, with predicted alteration of physical and chemical features, have been detected in the S protein that is postulated to be involved in the immunoreactions between the virus and its host. Two amino acid changes have been detected in the M protein, which could be related to viral envelope formation. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the possibility of non-human origin of the SARS-associated viruses but provides no evidence that they are man-made. Further efforts should focus on identifying the etiology of the SARS-associated virus and ruling out conclusively the existence of other possible SARS-related pathogen(s).\\ntitle: A complete sequence and comparative analysis of a SARS-associated virus (Isolate BJ01)', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 990}), Document(page_content='abstract: OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of caffeine on diaphragmatic activity, tidal volume (Vt), and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) in preterm infants. STUDY DESIGN Using transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG), we measured diaphragmatic activity from 30 minutes before (baseline) to 3 hours after administration of an intravenous caffeine-base loading dose in 30 spontaneously breathing preterm infants (mean gestational age, 29.1 ± 1.3 weeks), most of whom were on noninvasive respiratory support. Diaphragmatic activity was expressed as the percentage change in dEMG amplitude, area under the curve, respiratory rate, and inspiratory and expiratory times. Using respiratory inductive plethysmography, we measured changes in Vt and EELV from baseline. These outcome variables were calculated at 8 fixed time points after caffeine administration (5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes) and compared with baseline. RESULTS Caffeine administration resulted in rapid (within 5 minutes) increases in dEMG amplitude (median, 43%; IQR, 24%-63%; P < .001) and area under the curve (median, 28%; IQR, 14%-48%; P < .001). Vt also increased by a median of 30% (IQR, 7%-48%), and this change was significantly correlated with the change in dEMG amplitude (r = 0.67; P < .001). These effects were relatively stable until 120 minutes after caffeine administration. Caffeine did not consistently impact EELV, respiratory rate, or inspiratory and expiratory times. CONCLUSION Caffeine treatment results in a rapid and sustained increase in diaphragmatic activity and Vt in preterm infants.\\ntitle: The Effect of Caffeine on Diaphragmatic Activity and Tidal Volume in Preterm Infants.', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 991}), Document(page_content='abstract: Zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV), in particular the genotype (GT) 3 and GT4 strains, constitutes a major one health issue. Swine serves as an important reservoir and the processed pork products essentially contribute to foodborne transmission. This study comprehensively estimated HEV prevalence in domestic pigs, wild boars, and pork products. At global level, we found nearly 60% domestic pigs and 27% wild boars have ever encountered HEV infection based seroprevalence rate. Nearly 13% domestic and 9.5% wild swine are actively infected based on HEV RNA positivity. Importantly, about 10% of commercial pork products are HEV RNA positive, although available data are limited in this respect. Our results indicate the high prevalence rate of HEV infection in pigs and widespread contamination in pork products, although there are substantial variations at regional and country levels. These findings are important for better understanding the global epidemiology and clinical burden of HEV infection in human population related to zoonotic transmission.\\ntitle: Estimating the global prevalence of hepatitis E virus in swine and pork products', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 992}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Children seem relatively protected from serious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related disease, but little is known about children living in settings with high tuberculosis and HIV burden. This study reflects clinical data on South African children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We collected clinical data of children aged younger than 13 years with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 presenting to Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town between 17th of April and 24th of July 2020. RESULTS: Hundred and fifty-nine children (median age 48·0 months (interquartile range, IQR 12·0-106·0)) were included. Hospitalized children (n=62), median age of 13·5 months (IQR 1·8-43·5) were younger than children not admitted (n=97), median age 81·0 months (IQR 34·5-120·5, p< 0·01). Thirty-three of 159 (20·8%) children had pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty-one of 62 (82·3%) hospitalized children were symptomatic; lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 21/51 (41·2%) and 11/16 (68·8%) children younger than 3 months of age. Respiratory support was required in 25/51 (49·0%) children; 13/25 (52·0%) children were younger than 3 months. One child was HIV infected and 11/51 (21·2%) were HIV exposed uninfected and 7/51 (13·7%) children had a recent or new diagnosis of tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Children less than 1 year of age hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Cape Town frequently required respiratory support, the access to oxygen may be limited in some LMICs which could potentially drive morbidity and mortality. HIV infection was uncommon but a relationship between HIV exposure, tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 should be explored.\\ntitle: Clinical experience with SARS CoV-2 related illness in children - hospital experience in Cape Town, South Africa', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 993}), Document(page_content='abstract: Although great advances have been made on large-scale manufacturing of vaccines and antiviral-based drugs, viruses persist as the major cause of human diseases nowadays.

Herein, we narrated the different tactics of using biopeptides as antiviral molecules that could be used as an interesting alternative to treat COVID-19 patients. The number of peptides with antiviral effects is still low, but such peptides already displayed huge potentials to become pharmaceutically obtainable as antiviral medications. Studies showed that animal venoms, mammals, plant, and artificial sources are the main sources of antiviral peptides, when bioinformatics tools are used. This review spotlights bioactive peptides with antiviral activities against human viruses, especially the coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2 or SARS-nCOV19). We also showed the data about well-recognized peptides that are still under investigations, while presenting the most potent ones that may become medications for clinical use.\\ntitle: Potential “biopeptidal” therapeutics for severe respiratory syndrome coronaviruses: a review of antiviral peptides, viral mechanisms, and prospective needs', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 994}), Document(page_content='abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found that human mobility restrictions could not only prevent the spread of COVID-19, but also improve the air quality because of the reduction of industrial production, transportation and traffic. It is noteworthy that air quality is also closely related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we aimed to assess the mediating role of air quality on the association between human mobility and the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: We collected daily confirmed cases, human mobility data, air quality data and meteorological variables in 120 cities from China between January 23, 2020 and February 29, 2020. We applied the generalized additive model to examine the association of human mobility index with COVID-19 confirmed cases, and to assess the mediating effects of air quality index and each pollutant. RESULTS: We observed a significant positive relationship between human mobility index and the daily counts of COVID-19 confirmed cases. A unit increase in human mobility index (lag0–14) was associated with a 6.45% increase in daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, and air quality index significantly mediated 19.47% of this association. We also observed a positive relationship between human mobility index and air quality index. In the pollutant level analyses, we found significant mediating effects of PM(2.5), PM(10), and NO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that limiting human movements could reduce COVID-19 cases by improving air quality besides decreasing social contact.\\ntitle: The mediating effect of air quality on the association between human mobility and COVID-19 infection in China', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 995}), Document(page_content='abstract: Current COVID-19 predictive models primarily focus on predicting the risk of mortality, and rely on COVID-19 specific medical data such as chest imaging after COVID-19 diagnosis.

In particular, we developed unique and effective data processing algorithms, including data cleaning, initial feature screening, vector representation. Then we trained models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies combined with different parameter settings. Based on routinely collected EHR, our machine learning pipeline not only consistently outperformed those developed by other research groups using the same set of data, but also achieved similar accuracy as those trained on medical data that were only available after COVID-19 diagnosis.

The human to human transmission of this virus has also been established. Untill now the virus has infected more than seven thousand people and has spread to fifteen countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared 2019-nCoV as global health emergency due to its outburst well beyond China. There is need to develop some vaccines or therapeutics to control or prevent 2019-nCoV infections. The bottleneck with current conventional approaches is that these require longer time for vaccine development. However, computer assisted approaches help us to produce effective vaccine in short time compared with conventional methods. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was used to predict B cell and T cell epitopes of surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV that could be suitable to trigger significant immune response. The sequence of surface glycoprotein was collected from the database and analyzed to identify the immunogenic epitope. Both B cell and T cell epitopes were analyzed so the predicted epitopes can stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. We predicted 13 B cell and 05 T cell epitopes that later on were joined with GPGPG linker to make a single peptide. This computational approach to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against emerging 2019-nCoV allows us to find novel immunogenic epitopes against the antigen targets of surface 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. This multi epitope peptide vaccine may prove effective to combat 2019-nCoV infections.\\ntitle: In Silico Identification of Novel B Cell and T Cell Epitopes of Wuhan Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) for Effective Multi Epitope-Based Peptide Vaccine Production', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 997}), Document(page_content='abstract: Multi-system involvement and rapid clinical deterioration are hallmarks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related mortality. The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID-19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolar-parenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O2 supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics. Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles. Overwhelming immune response associated with \"cytokine storms\" could activate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in consumption of nitric oxide (NO), a critical vasodilation regulator. In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase (MPO) in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O2 at heme binding sites, decreasing O2 saturation. Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption. Connecting these reactions in a multi-hit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to develop therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.\\ntitle: A Multiple-Hit Hypothesis Involving Reactive Oxygen Species and Myeloperoxidase Explains Clinical Deterioration and Fatality in COVID-19', metadata={'source': 'data/sample_1000.csv', 'row': 998}), Document(page_content='abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China, and has spread quickly to 72 countries to date.
